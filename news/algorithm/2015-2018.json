          "bodyText": "In my salad days, a boutique was a chichi independent clothes shop, as to be found the length and breadth of London’s King’s Road. Heave a half brick in any direction and you could guarantee to bean a loon-panted young groover hellbent on setting the fashion world alight. But no longer. “Boutique” has become the prefix de nos jours for altogether different outfits. Boutique hotels are 10 a penny, boutique spas are also available should you so wish, while boutique banks are also in our midst, though the meaning of the word when applied to the latter is quite beyond me. Equally bewildering are boutique butchers and bakers. Enough already. Talking of finance, I was overjoyed to read the following: “The Bank for International Settlement said in its quarterly report that the CCPs could cause ‘a destabilising feedback loop, amplifying stress’.” You can say that again. Far more thrilling matters are to be found in the work of the Pentagon’s Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team. Its mission statement makes glorious reading. “The AWCFT will initially provide computer vision algorithms for object detection, classification and alerts for FMV PED. Further sprints will incorporate more advanced computer vision technology. “After successful sprints in support of Intelligence, Surveillance Reconnaissance, the AWCFT will prioritise the integration of similar technologies into other defence intelligence mission areas. AWCFT will also consolidate existing algorithm-based technology initiatives related to mission areas of the Defence Intelligence Enterprise.” Good stuff, I’m sure you’ll agree, what with all that sprinting and all those initiatives, and I think we can now sleep soundly in our beds knowing that the Pentagon is up to speed on defending the free world, especially if that bed is in a boutique hotel. •Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"

          "bodyText": "Billion Surprise Toys Johny Johny Yes Papa If you look at the most popular YouTube videos of all time, a surprising number are badly rendered 3D cartoon nursery rhymes. Their success begets hundreds of copycat videos all of which seem to be created by algorithm rather human intervention. Perhaps that is how we arrived with this surrealist masterpiece, a kind of Vic &amp; Bob meets Adult Swim netherworld but more wonderful because it’s aimed at children. The video combines another meme, the Baby Shark song, with an old nursery rhyme Johny Johny Yes Papa in a 3D animation where a father accuses his child of lying while dancing like David Brent. Frank Ocean Moon River In the same way that Fred Armisen can say anything and make it funny, Ocean could sing the Sidebar of Shame and imbue it with a sense of late-capitalist ennui. Here, he turns his lattice-like overdubbed vocals towards the old standard Moon River and makes it feel like a weird King Krule demo recorded in a south London underpass. Nicholas Brittel Succession Main Title The theme from HBO’s Succession, with its tumbling piano runs and discordant lunges, perfectly mirrored the backstabbing and bitching of the family-run media empire portrayed in the show. Admittedly, they did somewhat overuse it in the series – it re-emerges nine times an episode – but to listen to this on its own is to place yourself on the top floor of a New York skyscraper, furiously masturbating over your own sense of importance. Ariana Grande Them Changes The story goes that Grande wasn’t keen on doing any covers in this album cycle, but Radio 1 gave her a total free pick. So unlike most Live Lounge performances, which have to be of current Top 40 singles, she ended up doing a three-year-old Thundercat song. The result is a flip-reverse of the normal Live Lounge equilibrium: instead of a trendy band covering a big pop song you got the biggest artist of the year gliding through Thundercat’s cosmic funk like a Maglev train heading to a party in the bad part of town. Adam Buxton Like and Subscribe So many fantastic Buxton-penned songs on his podcast this year that it’s difficult to pick one, but for me Like and Subscribe just about edges it. Perhaps it’s the way it descends into a late-90s Aphex Twin bubblescape while still conveying an important message about liking and indeed subscribing. 10/10."

          "bodyText": "﻿Luxor 2-4 players, 30-45 minutes, £29.99 This family-friendly game of rival archaeologists sees players racing to explore an ancient Egyptian tomb, uncovering priceless artefacts as they make their way along a twisting underground passage. At first glance it resembles roll-and-move games such as Monopoly or Ludo. But where those traditional family favourites rely heavily on luck, Luxor is more tactical. It uses clever card play to determine how you progress along its subterranean track, emphasising smart decisions rather than chance. As you delve deeper into the tomb you will discover an assortment of treasures that boost your score and gain new, more powerful cards that let you carve out advantages over your opponents. It is an addictive blend of fast and thoughtful gameplay and, while its grave-robbing theme may not be culturally sensitive, it is quick, elegant and accessible – an ideal option for anyone dipping their toes into modern board games for the first time. Word Slam 3+ players, 30-45 minutes, £28 For many families, a post-turkey game of charades is a Christmas staple, and the festive season would not feel quite complete without watching uncle Fred turning purple with rage while trying to mime “The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe”. This team-based game of clever communication aims to create the same kind of feel, but rather than making you wildly gesticulate, it challenges you to convey messages to your teammates using a vocabulary of just 105 words printed on cards. This turns out to be trickier than you might think. You could end up expressing “Super Mario” as: “Play with red blue jump man,” or “hedgehog” as: “Small brown not fast animal.” With such a small pool of words at your disposal, you will have to be creative to get your meaning across, and if it is difficult for the player coming up with the message, it is just as tough for the other members of their team trying to decipher it. With both sides simultaneously attempting to guess the same word, there is real competitive tension. And if you are playing with kids, the game comes with a selection of difficulty levels, letting you tailor its setup to players of all ages. Blue Lagoon 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes, £29.99 This deceptively simple game casts players as the leaders of Polynesian tribes vying to explore and settle a cluster of tropical islands. On each turn you will place one of your tribespeople on the board, claiming areas of land and water. The aim is to spread your people as widely as you can across the map, but also to control the islands by having more members of your tribe on them than your opponents. Along the way, you will also boost your score by picking up resources such as bamboo and coconuts. With multiple ways to earn points, you will face some tricky decisions as you try to work out the best ways to place your people. And even once you have come up with a plan, you will need to seize vital sections of the board before your rivals. The result is that, in spite of its sunny artwork and idyllic island theme, Blue Lagoon reveals a brutal competitive streak as you cut your opponents off from the territories they most need. It is enough to spark some intense grudges, and it is impressive just how much antagonism and strategy the game squeezes out of some very straightforward rules. Troll &amp; Dragon 2-5 players, 10-20 minutes, £17.99 Troll &amp; Dragon, a child-friendly game of courageous treasure hunters, sees players sneaking through caverns guarded by ferocious monsters, helping themselves to as much loot as they can carry in the process. Each turn starts by rolling and re-rolling dice in an effort to accumulate diamonds. But each time you do it, you risk attracting the attention of an angry troll, dropping your treasure as you flee. From there you will move on to a dragon’s cave, where things become more heated. Once again you will roll dice, this time aiming to grab precious golden nuggets. But as you do, your opponents will also roll a set of red dragon dice, attempting to wake the slumbering beast and chase you off empty-handed. The result is a fast-paced and frantic scramble. To escape with your ill-gotten goodies you will have to judge when to push your luck and when to turn and run. It takes some quick-thinking analysis of risks and rewards, and watching young players trying to find that balance can be hilarious, making for riotous fun for grown ups as well as kids. Gizmos 2-4 players, 40-50 minutes, £32.99 The first thing that strikes you about this game of strange contraptions and eccentric engineers is the giant cardboard structure it deposits in the middle of your table. It is a container full of coloured marbles with a chute-like mechanism that lets them slide out as you play, and it looks a bit like something Wile E Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation. Look beyond this physical gimmick, though, and you will find a slick and streamlined game about inventors trying to claim the top prize in a prestigious science fair. You will battle to build machines that impress the judges, harvesting different types of energy – represented by those shiny marbles – and spending it to add new components to your growing creation. You will unlock new abilities, generate extra power and make ever-more dramatic plays as you fight to establish your scientific supremacy. There is a powerful sense of progression as you incrementally augment your machine, and it is deeply satisfying seeing its parts starting to work together. But with players taking just a single action on each of their turns, it never gets bogged down in complexity, and as soon as one game is over, you will be itching to start another. Keyforge: Call of the Archons 2 players, 30-45 minutes, from £8.99 In 1993, the designer Richard Garfield released Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that cast players as powerful mages doing battle in a fantasy universe. It became a smash hit, with players building collections of cards and using them to create custom decks, all fine-tuned for different strategies. But it also led to the growth of a secondary market, with powerful cards sometimes changing hands for hundreds of pounds online. Garfield’s latest game aims to side-step this collector mania. Like Magic, Keyforge sees players command armies of beasts and warriors in card-based conflict. But rather than building your own deck, you will buy a pre-constructed one assembled by a computer algorithm. It is a novel approach, and it makes Keyforge much cheaper to get into than other card battlers. But it is also a fascinating game in its own right, with plenty of interesting tactical decisions and clever card combinations to discover. The game goes out of its way to ensure you have something interesting to do on almost every turn, and contests swing back and forth as players deploy their troops, clash in combat and exploit an array of special powers and abilities. It makes for some dramatic and unpredictable moments as the fight for supremacy plays out on your kitchen table. Wildlands 2-4 players, 30-60 minutes, £59.99 Miniature battle games have a reputation for complexity. But Wildlands, a fantasy skirmish game that sees players command squads of warriors in fast and furious combat, aims to make things quicker, simpler and infinitely more approachable. It hands players command of an assortment of sword fighters, archers and magically-powered automatons, throwing them into a frantic struggle for survival. The aim is to outsmart and overpower your opponents, gaining points for killing off enemy troops and collecting magic crystals scattered around the board. In the process, you will come up with clever plans and react to your rivals’ plays, picking off your foes with well-placed crossbow bolts or charging headlong into hand-to-hand combat. The result is a game full of twists, turns and dramatic moments, where lone soldiers put up heroic last stands against multiple assailants, fleet-footed rogues dive out of the path of volleys of arrows, and grizzled sorcerers lob fireballs at one another across darkened corridors. What is most impressive is that Wildlands conjures so much action and drama with so little mechanical clunkiness. Everything in the game revolves around simple sets of symbols on cards, and it combines real tactical depth with pick-up-and-play simplicity. It also comes with four different factions to command, and a double-sided board giving you either a ruined city or a subterranean dungeon to battle over, ensuring your clashes have plenty of variety.

          "bodyText": "The Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what’s happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you’re not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe. To tech-bros, your pregnancy is an advertising opportunity Silicon Valley has a woman problem. The tech industry is notorious for its gender disparity and despite lots of talk about “diversity”, companies like Google and Facebook have made little progress in stamping out gender bias, nor in recruiting and retaining more female engineers. This affects all of us every single day. When the algorithms that govern increasingly large parts of our lives have been designed almost exclusively by young bro-grammers with homogeneous experiences and worldviews, those algorithms are going to fail significant sections of society. A heartbreaking example of this is Gillian Brockell’s experience of continuing to get targeted by pregnancy-related ads on Facebook after the stillbirth of her son. Brockell, a Washington Post journalist, recently made headlines when she tweeted an open letter to big tech companies, imploring them to think more carefully about how they target parenting ads. “Please, Tech Companies,” she wrote. “If you’re smart enough to realize that I’m pregnant, that I’ve given birth, then surely you’re smart enough to realize that my baby died, and can advertise to me accordingly, or maybe, just maybe, not at all.” After Brockell’s letter went viral, Facebook’s vice-president of advertising, Rob Goldman, apologized to Brockell on Twitter. He also patronizingly pointed out that she could have avoided the situation if only she’d taken the time to navigate Facebook’s ever-changing settings and tweaked her ad preferences. “We have a setting available that can block ads about some topics people may find painful – including parenting,” he explained. Brockell, it should be noted, did go on to block parenting ads … and immediately started getting ads from adoption agencies. (“And no, I have not been googling about adoption,” she tweeted. “I am miles away from anything but grieving.”) Goldman’s interactions with Brockell on Twitter make clear he sees her painful experience as the sad result of an isolated “bug”. “I would like to debug how this ad was shown,” he told her, “so we can improve the way this control works.” But, of course, it’s not an isolated bug or flawed algorithm that is responsible: it’s Silicon Valley’s ethics-free, male-centric culture. It doesn’t matter how sophisticated your algorithms are, when you treat pregnancy as an advertising event, an opportunity to be monetized, you will get situations like this. When your engineers consist largely of twentysomething dudes, you will get situations like this. When you think about your users as data-points rather than thinking, feeling, complex human beings, you will get situations like this. Facebook is always going on about connecting people; bringing people closer together. But as Brockell’s experience makes abundantly clear, it seems to have very little understanding of people at all. Japanese medical schools excluded female applicants A government investigation has found that at least nine Japanese medical schools manipulated exam results in favour of male candidates. Juntendo University said that they did this for purely benevolent reasons. “Women mature faster mentally than men, and their communication ability is also higher by the time they take the university exam,” the dean told reporters. “In some ways, this was a measure to help male applicants.” Ah, that’s OK then. Putting a price on rape Jacob Walter Anderson, a former fraternity president at Baylor University accused of rape, will not face any jail time after accepting a plea deal. Anderson, who was charged with four counts of sexual assault, after a 19-year-old student accused him of assaulting her at a fraternity party, will have to pay a $400 fine and go to counselling. His light sentence has provoked outrage, and sparked renewed conversation about how difficult it is to prosecute sexual assault cases. Women make movies $$$ Movies with a female lead perform better at the box office than those lacking the xx factor, according to a new study by Creative Artists Agency’s digital strategy firm, shift7. The study also found that films that passed the Bechdel test do better at the box office than those that don’t. A feminist proposal If Pinterest is anything to go by (and it probably isn’t) a lot of women are going to be proposing to their partners this engagement season. Searches for “Women propose to men ideas” are apparently up 336% this year. And searches for “unique lesbian proposals” are up 1,352%. Weekend reads What would a city that is safe for women look like? asks the Guardian, in an interesting piece that looks at the intersection of feminism and urban planning. “Failing to acknowledge women’s part in sustaining white supremacy is not just sexist; it’s a dangerous mistake,” writes Glenna Gordon in a piece about American Women of the Far Right, for the New York Review of Books. Gordon provides a fascinating profile of some frightening figures. Do women have better sex under socialism? Vox interviews anthropologist Kristen Ghodsee about her new book, which argues socialist policies are good for society and our sex lives. It’s an interesting way of reframing how capitalism disproportionately harms caregivers."

          "headline": "New Zealand courts banned naming Grace Millane’s accused killer. Google just emailed it out",
          "bodyText": "Imagine if a media company told you the name of the man accused of killing Grace Millane. Imagine if, in defiance of a very clear court ruling of interim name suppression, that company told you his name in an email – spelling it out, even, in the subject header. Unthinkable? That’s exactly what happened in the early hours of Tuesday. The media company wasn’t (New Zealand’s) the Herald or Stuff. It wasn’t TVNZ or Newshub or RNZ. New Zealand media outlets, from the hobbyist bloggers to the biggest broadcasters, respected the proscription on naming the accused. Of course they did: they understand consequences for breaching such an order, and in fact spend significant time and resource policing their social media channels to ensure their audience doesn’t breach suppression either. Not just because the courts would take action against them for doing so. They understand, too, that it would be morally odious to do so: it could risk damaging the course of justice in an appalling murder that has left a family distraught and sent waves of grief and upset through the country. The company that paid precisely zero heed to all that is a media and technology corporation from Silicon Valley. A global colossus against which all of New Zealand’s media companies combined amount to a dim pixel. The company is Google. Shortly after midnight on Tuesday this week, it delivered to everyone signed up to its “what’s trending in New Zealand” email the name of the 26-year-old accused of the most headlined crime in this country in 2018. Yesterday the minister of justice, Andrew Little, castigated offshore media companies that had, outside New Zealand’s jurisdiction, chosen to name the accused. In the main, those outlets have at least geoblocked these stories, meaning they’re not immediately accessible from New Zealand. Little also added his voice to repeated pleas from the police for social media users not to post the name of the accused. Over recent years we’ve grown used to angry, vengeful or attention-seeking social media users posting suppressed names. The digital titans’ typical response has been to throw their arms in the air. We’re impotent! We’ll do something if you alert us to it! Maybe! But this is next-level. You didn’t have to go searching to find the name on the internet. Google put it right in your inbox. You didn’t even need to click to open the email. His name was in the subject field. Shouldn’t Google then be hauled before the courts? What did they have to say for themselves – was this defensible, and what processes did they have in place to stop this sort of thing happening? A spokesperson for Google in New Zealand (based in Australia) responded to those questions by saying, “we wouldn’t comment on specifics”. That’s a no-comment on the specific fact that they dispatched an email with the name of the accused – information unequivocally suppressed by NZ courts – in the headline. They directed me, however, to Google’s “legal removal requests” page, where users can submit material they believe “may violate the law” so that the company might “consider blocking, removing or restricting access to it”. Quite how they might block or remove an email sent several hours earlier was not clear. In rationalising such a reactive, wild-west approach on questions like these, companies such as Google and Facebook like to plead that they are not in the business of censorship, that they embrace the “open internet”, and that – hey – they’re tech companies, all of this is automated. What can we do, they protest, issuing a quick shrug before returning to the important task of counting the money. After all you can hardly haul an algorithm before a judge, can you? An algorithm is intangible, untouchable! And that’s true, you can’t put an algorithm in the stocks, even if that’s a theatrically appealing thought. But you can bring to heel companies that are having a malign impact on your democracy. Google and Facebook may revel in their tech-utopian borderless-world waffle, but they are not beyond regulation. It’s a miracle, really, that they’ve so successfully evaded any meaningful regulation for so long. Around the world, governments are waking up to this. In examples such as Europe’s “right to be forgotten” rules, it’s dawning on lawmakers that Google and Facebook and the rest are not Gods or weather. Like the rest of us they must adhere to the laws of nation states in which they operate. If you doubt that they operate in New Zealand, consider the millions of public money poured into them – money which once would have fed back into systems which generated local journalism. New Zealand is slowly beginning to scrutinise these digital giants – Facebook sent emissaries from Sydney to Wellington yesterday to speak to government officials about “privacy, content governance and site integrity” – but we’re still well off the pace. There was no New Zealand presence among the representatives of eight parliaments who gathered in London for an “international grand committee on disinformation and fake news”, spurred by the urgent concern about the social media giant’s impact on elections and democracy more generally. Mark Zuckerberg was invited, over and over again. He failed to show, so they empty-chaired him. In Australia they’re waking up, too. This week its competition regulator called for the creation of a new regulator to check the extraordinary and disproportionate dominance of Facebook and Google, demanding more transparency around the hallowed algorithm and emphasising its impact on the public good that is journalism. “When you get to a certain stage and you get market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities and that means, also, additional scrutiny,” said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman. The most extraordinary thing of all is that such a statement of the bleedingly obvious could be extraordinary. Facebook and Google continue to get away with it in part because they perpetuate a residual image of the original digital iconoclasts, the techbro disruptors, sticking it to The Man. But this is breathtaking bullshit, the finest Jedi mind trick of our day. They are The Man. These companies have a combined value of well over a trillion US dollars. The freewheeling techbros have grown into arrogant, avaricious, suppurating Leviathans. They preach the open internet on the back of the most opaque machines in big business. They’ve released a wrecking ball into traditional media, and so the public square, and so democracy. They’re brilliant and addictive, and staffed by some of the cleverest people in the world. It’s hard to imagine life without them. And they’ve hoovered up all the revenue and none of the responsibility. No longer are these anything like the anti-establishment hackers who vow “don’t be evil” – Google ditched that motto years ago. They wield a kind of power that we’ve never before seen. And they wield it with something close to impunity. They know things about you that you don’t even know yourself. They just sent out an email to an unknown number of New Zealanders that defied a court ruling by naming the man accused of murder in our country’s most infamous crime of 2018. But it’s a small country somewhere down the arse end of the world. How much does it matter to them? They have no comment. This article was first published in The Spinoff.

As Tumblr began the task of removing the type of adult content it had become synonymous with ahead of the outright ban, users took to Twitter to migrate and preserve their posts, but also to ridicule the platform’s bizarre new judgment calls. Art depicting a vomiting unicorn, a photo of Joe Biden, a raw chicken labelled “Patrick”, and a man hugging a lion all became #TooSexyForTumblr as its algorithm incorrectly flagged them as inappropriate. “Tumblr’s AI is basically a stoned 13-year-old boy,” one user said. “Everything looks like a butt.” Tumblr’s decision to remove all adult content was provoked by an incident last month involving child pornography, which was discovered on the site after its moderation systems failed to detect it. The platform was swiftly removed from the Apple App Store, which has a strict no-adult-content policy. But preventing the spread of child pornography is something many other platforms seem to handle just fine without the drastic removal of all adult content. It’s arguable that Tumblr’s decision has less to do with a desire to “[lay] the foundation for a better Tumblr”, as CEO Jeff D’Onofrio said, than with a need to bow to the pressures exerted on it by Apple’s growing control over online content via its App store. In fact, along with wearing black turtlenecks and dropping acid, one of the unfortunate postures Steve Jobs made ubiquitous in the tech sector is prudery towards adult content. Apple has been consistent in its resistance against it, with Jobs famously saying that “users who want porn can get an android phone”. As a consequence, fewer and fewer services support adult content due to the moral policing carried out by Apple. The increasing crackdown on porn in the tech community is nothing new (see Craigslist losing its personals section this year), but Tumblr’s decision is particularly distressing in that the platform had evolved over the years into a sanctuary for non-normative and female-centric sexuality. Since the announcement, the adult content community and users have been mourning the vacuum it leaves. It was arguably the last place where feminist, kink, queer, and gender non-normative adult content flourished online. Accounts were carefully curated over years, and offered a sense of commonality to people with even the most niche interests or predilections. It is (or was) a space infinitely more tolerant and diverse than the rest of the porn world. It received praise as a space for gender transition stories as well as a place for queer sexual identities. In 2015 more mainstream websites such as Bustle and Refinery29, and even the Telegraph, began writing about female-friendly porn Tumblrs. They read like porn-101 guides, pushing adult Tumblrs into the mainstream and bringing them to young women who were perhaps struggling to find adult content that wasn’t at worst disturbing, or at best simply a turn-off. In a survey carried out by Marie Claire in 2015, 56% of women said they felt uncomfortable with the portrayal of women in mainstream porn. Tumblr represented an outwardly feminist and even ethical alternative. Its carefully curated content offered a more positive vision of sex to these women, one predicated on body positivity, diversity, female pleasure, and often intimacy. It became the place you went to enjoy porn by women for women – looped footage focusing on female gratification; photographs depicting women with relatable body types; writing and art closer to the sensual than the explicit; fan art drawing on female sexual fantasies; diverse representations of desirable hetero men; and a sense of humour. In his blog post about the ban, D’Onofrio attempted to acknowledge Tumblr’s significance as an outlet for marginalised groups. “We recognise Tumblr is also a place to speak freely about topics like art, sex positivity, your relationships, your sexuality, and your personal journey” – but, he added: “Bottom line: There are [sic] no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them.” D’Onofrio failed to recognise how the disappearance of Tumblr porn in particular strips women and female-identifying people of a space they had claimed for female experience and feminist expression that was also, importantly, free! And while alternative sites are available and gaining traction, the reality is that in the current anti-porn climate, and the ubiquity of the Apple App Store, it will be difficult to have the same widespread impact as Tumblr had. This capitulation exposes what was already known: that the non-normative adult community is at odds with the heteronormative values of Silicon Valley – what’s more, this particularly targets women. Tumblr’s new revised guidelines prohibit “female-presenting nipples” and state that “written content such as erotica, nudity related to political or newsworthy speech, and nudity found in art, such as sculptures and illustrations, are also stuff that can be freely posted”. Who is to decide what is “political or newsworthy speech”? What is going to classify exactly as “art”? And where do we draw the line between “erotica” and porn? Making that call is not simply a matter of standards but rather arbitrary, and can involve politically charged decisions with very specific cultural repercussions. When tech companies leverage their power to police what is sexually acceptable, it should be seen for what it is – a bid to control our most intimate lives and personal connections alongside everything else they now control in the public sphere. As our romantic and sexual lives become increasingly intertwined with our online lives, the adult content available in the digital commons is an important frontier where narratives can be negotiated and reframed, particularly those of women and gender non-normative people. We should not allow tech companies with paternalistic and puritanical attitudes towards porn to take control of that narrative or to have the last word. • Roisin Agnew is an Irish journalist and screenwriter"

          "bodyText": "Spoiler warning: deaths up to the end of season seven of Game of Thrones discussed herein. Researchers in Australia have calculated the key indicators of survival in the final season of HBO’s Game of Thrones, based on a study of the cause of death of all 186 characters that met their fate in the first seven seasons of the show. The study, published in the journal Injury Epidemiology on Monday and available online, found that characters with the greatest chance of survival were prominent characters who had switched allegiance at least once, with lesser determining factors being that both female characters and characters that were highborn tended to live longer. That would put Cersei Lannister, currently installed on the Iron Throne, in a good position to survive the series. It also, says co-author Reidar Lystad, a research fellow with the Australian Institute of Health Innovation at Macquarie University in Sydney, applies to sisters Sansa and Arya Stark, although some fans would object to the suggestion Arya ever truly switched allegiances. Daenerys Targaryen, the one with the dragons, has not switched allegiances and therefore stands a higher likelihood of dying in season eight. Jon Snow switched allegiances to Daenerys in season seven, slightly reducing his chance of dying, although he has already died once. Bran Stark could be said to have switched allegiances to become the Three-Eyed Raven. Jaime Lannister, last seen abandoning his sister/lover and riding north, could also see his chances of survival going up, and Tyrion Lannister was already a turncoat. To compile the data, Lystad and his co-author Ben Brown, a fellow Macquarie University academic, rewatched all 67 episodes of the first seven seasons of the show and noted the number of important characters, when they were introduced, whether they died, how they died and how much time they spent on screen before dying. They were then demographically categorised as high or lowborn, “silk collar workers” versus “boiled leather collar workers”, and by their stated religion. The probability of dying within the first hour after being introduced was 14%. An important character was defined as a human (no White Walkers or direwolves) listed in either the opening or closing credits who did not appear only in a flashback. Non-credited characters were bumped up to important characters if they interacted with another character in an important way. They identified 330 important characters, of which 186, or 56.4%, had died by the end of season seven. Of those deaths 63% were caused by assault, 24.4% by operations of war, 11.8% by burns, and 4.8% by poisoning. Only one is listed to have died in a “sports and athletics arena” or of a “crushing injury of head” (RIP Oberyn). About a third died in their home. The shortest-lived character was Olly’s father, who was shot dead by Ygritte just 11 seconds after first appearing on screen in season four, episode three. His death motivated his son, Olly, to kill Ygritte and later join in the fatal stabbing of Jon. Ygritte is included in the death data as one of 11 killed by assault by other specified sharp object, in this case an arrow. Jon Snow’s death was not counted because it didn’t stick. According to an algorithm created by students at the Technical University of Munich in 2016, he should never have died at all. “What we did with these characters that have been resurrected – and Jon Snow is just one of them – is if they come back to life and feature in the show, then we have not counted them as being actually or really dead,” Lystad said. “So they fall in the alive category, at least for now.” The longest surviving characters are Jon Snow and Bran Stark, who have been alive for 57 hours and 15 minutes. Lystad and Brown included several tips for the showrunners to decrease the rate of violent deaths in the show based on real-world historical factors that are linked to declining death rate, including focus on commerce over conflict, increased investment in institutions that improve public health and wellbeing like schools and hospitals, improving the built environment, and developing evidence-based violence prevention policies. But Lystad admitted that would not necessarily make for an exciting show. “I don’t think they will take me up on that,” he said. Game of Thrones season eight will air on HBO in April 2019."

          "headline": "Technologist Vivienne Ming: 'AI is a human right'",
          "bodyText": "There is a surefire way to make Vivienne Ming flinch. It is a reaction she has to the bullish claims that big tech firms like to make. As federal investigations hit Facebook and global protests plague Google, the mantra remains. Artificial intelligence will make all our lives better. Poverty, mental health, climate change, inequality? All can be solved with AI. As a Silicon Valley technologist, entrepreneur and theoretical neuroscientist, Ming might easily have fallen under the same spell as her tech firm counterparts. She is a firm believer that AI will become an ever more powerful tool, after all. And what could be more west coast than a Human Potential Maximiser? But Ming’s take is different and perhaps life experience is why. Vivienne Ming was once Evan Smith, a wretched, troubled student at the University of California, San Diego, who dropped out, became homeless, and then clawed his way back to glittering success. It would be simplistic to call Ming an arch sceptic, but not unreasonable. What bothers her is not AI. What makes her flinch are the people behind it. “We are entrusting some of the most profound problems in the history of human experience to a bunch of very young men who have never solved a problem in their lives,” she says. “They have never done anything from scratch to make someone’s life better.” Evan Smith pulled his life around in his 20s. Having lived in his car in Mountain View, battling demons he struggled to understand, he was admitted to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh where he studied neuroscience. There he met his future wife, Norma Chang, who stuck with him when he confessed his wish to be a woman. The couple, who use the mash-up surname Ming, have two children. After a career spent setting up companies and organisations to take on problems in education, health and the workplace, the couple founded the thinktank Socos in Berkeley, California, where they now work together. Ming calls the work “mad science”, but it is far from mad. She does consultancy for startups, American states, public institutions and the United Nations. They call her in for advice on the use of AI and neuroscience to steer hiring practices, the treatment of employees, and better ways to support students. On Tuesday evening Ming will join a panel of world-leading AI thinkers at the Barbican in London for the Royal Society’s final event in its You and AI series. Chaired by Brian Cox, a physicist and TV presenter, the panel will take questions on the impact AI will have on jobs; the risks it may pose to society, and its ability, perhaps, to make moral and ethical decisions. At the heart of the problem that troubles Ming is the training that computer engineers receive and their uncritical faith in AI. Too often, she says, their approach to a problem is to train a neural network on a mass of data and expect the result to work fine. She berates companies for failing to engage with the problem first – applying what is already known about good employees and successful students, for example – before applying the AI. “These are very smart men. They are not malicious. But we are asking them who should I hire, how should we deal with mental illness, who should go to prison and for how long, and they have no idea how to solve these problems. AI is a genuinely powerful tool for solving problems, but if you can’t work out the solution to a problem yourself, an AI will not work it out for you.“ Amazon is a case in point. Ming says the tech firm once tried to recruit her as a chief scientist. The company would soon have a million employees, she was told, and it would be her job to make their lives better. “It became very clear that Jeff Bezos’s idea of better was very different to mine,” she says. The company’s invention of a wristband that buzzed when factory staff reached for the wrong package did not meet with her approval. It didn’t end there. Ming heard about the firm’s hopes to build an algorithm that could automate the hiring process, an idea she says she criticised at the time. In October, news broke that the firm had scrapped the project because it was biased against women. The algorithm scoured applicants’ CVs and ranked them on a five star scale. But because it trained on Amazon data, it learned that male applicants fared best in the workplace. It penalised those with the word “women’s” on their CVs, as in “women’s rowing champion”, and downgraded graduates from women’s colleges. “They thought they could throw an algorithm at the problem and it would figure it out,” says Ming. “But if a company doesn’t know how to solve the problem of bias, an AI will not solve the problem for them. After a couple of years working on it they dragged it out behind the barn and shot it in the back of the head.” Ming, who says she turned down offers from Uber and Netflix, took a different tack at a startup called Gild. The firm found that traits like resilience and what Ming calls a “growth mindset” – the flexibility to learn from one’s failures – predicted better software engineers, as rated by human coders. So the firm built small AIs to crawl blogs, LinkedIn and social media feeds for the best candidates, whether they were job hunting or not. Sometimes, a lone tweet carried enormous weight. One read: “Celery is awesome.” Out of context it sounds “like someone who is fundamentally wrong about a gross food,” says Ming. But “celery” was a reference to an obscure job queue tool written in the programming language, Python. The tweet, and the passion it contained, was a “huge predictor” of the candidate’s coding skills. To get back on track we need an AI revolution, Ming says, one that moves beyond correlation to causality. Throw a neural network at a pile of data and it will find patterns that can predict a person’s grades, their job prospects, or the odds they will reoffend. But correlations can hide the most appalling biases, the sort that rank black men at a higher risk for reoffending. We need AIs that know the real causes of what makes someone a reoffender, a great employee, a grade-A student. “We need that knowledge built in, and I am routinely shocked at how infrequently it is done in AI,” she says. It is not the only problem. The benefits of AI flow disproportionately to the rich. Take educational apps. “The whole reason you build these systems is to help kids who are struggling, but the biggest market is getting an extra couple of points on the Sats for the elite performers, because in the end, that is where the market is,” says Ming. “Almost every technology is inequality increasing because the people who are best able to make use of it are those who need it least: 99.999% of the world’s population has no say in how any of this is used. We need to think of AI as a human right, the same way we think of judicial review and access to vaccines.” Every year, swarms of freshly minted PhD graduates pour into tech firms without the faintest idea how to solve real-world problems. That will not change any time soon. A thorough grounding in ethics will help, but Ming believes it takes more than learning the rules from a book. “Ethics is like resilience, you get good at it by failing. To act ethically you have to understand all of the consequences of the solution you are proposing,” she says. With big tech so dominated by young, largely white men, it may be women and other marginalised people who drive the revolution Ming says is needed. “I think it’s incredibly valuable for people who have suffered in some way to have a voice in this. If you come from a background like mine, you are sceptical. You realise that technology increases inequality and it only gets better if we take active steps to avoid that.”"

          "headline": "World watches as Australian regulator rules on Facebook and Google",
          "bodyText": "A titanic struggle is taking place between some of the world’s largest corporations. In one corner is Google and Facebook. In the other is News Corporation. It’s not alone. It stands with most of the established media companies which have watched with growing horror as their advertising revenues have migrated into the coffers of the digital behemoths. Alphabet, Google’s parent, reported worldwide revenues of US$33bn in the third quarter and is on track to top US$120bn in 2018, mostly from advertising. Facebook’s revenues topped US$40bn in 2017 and have continued to grow during 2018. In just 10 years, the platforms have gone from nothing to hoovering up the majority of advertising dollars in Australia. In contrast, News Corporation and most media companies have seen their revenues draining way. It began with what used to be known as print media, but are probably now better described as news media sites. Now the conflagration has spread to free to air television, which depends on advertising for their existence. Their content is often republished on sites such as Facebook and YouTube without compensation, diverting eyeballs and diminishing their value to advertisers. According to the journalists’ union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the media sector has lost about 3,000 journalist positions since the growth of digital platforms escalated about 10 years ago. The loss in the newspaper sector has been the most severe, down from 23,472 employees in 2010-11 to just 14,678 by June 2017. Some new digital jobs have been created but the impact is a net loss. The beef the media companies have is that they invest in the journalism while the digital platforms simply take their output and republish it on people’s feeds and within their own news products. It’s a complicated relationship: on the one hand the news media companies acknowledge they need Google and Facebook to reach younger audiences, who don’t read newspapers, visit websites or watch broadcast television. On the other hand, the financial benefit of their hard work is going straight to these multinationals, and now threatens their very existence. A year ago the government, after intensive lobbying from the big Australian media companies, asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate whether these multinational digital services have an unfair advantage in the market, and whether they are abusing their market power. This week we will get the preliminary view of the ACCC. Chairman Rod Sims’ approach will have far reaching effects on the Australian media in the future. It will be important globally. His views will be studied by regulators around the world, all of whom are grappling with whether and how to ensure Google, Facebook et al don’t lead to the death of important and much loved media in their local communities. Here’s some of the suggestions that have been floated. Break up Google One of the biggest complaints about Google is that it is vertically integrated and uses its businesses to keep people within the Google ecosystem. In its latest submission, News Corp Australia argues that a separate ad-free Google News site was merely a tool to drive more traffic to Google search so it could monetise its services through mining user browsing data and then targeting ads to those users. “Google makes every effort to keep the user within its own ecosystem, by including snippets of news that allow users to effectively read the key points without clicking through to the full article,” News says in its latest submission. It’s also both the gateway to the internet and news content and an “intermediator” between readers and publishers through the provision of its Google News service, News says, and it uses these dual roles to generate revenue for Google at the expense of publishers. Google disputes this and denies it misuses “snippets of news articles” so that users do not click on links of news websites. “Google has no financial incentive to prevent users from clicking on links to news articles in response to their queries on Google Search and Google News. Because advertisers decide which search queries their ads will appear against, very few of them elect to advertise against queries that relate to news information,” it says. Then there are Google businesses like Double Click. In order to obtain a reliable audience and advertising data relating to content featured, News argues publishers must pay for Google Analytics, and cannot use third party analytics software. Google says it has been working with news publishers to address changing consumer behaviour, by sharing at least 70 per cent of ad revenue when they display ads from Google, and partnering with publishers to promote quality journalism online through the Google News Initiative and Google News Lab. Fairfax Media has been part of the Google News Initiative and is generally supportive. However, it said “we see substantially less progress in commercial partnership opportunities with Facebook. It is our view that Facebook’s commercial interests are largely served by keeping users within Facebook’s environment.” Ditto some of the smaller platforms such as Snapchat. “A clear preferred pathway is for publishers and platforms to explore and implement commercial, market-based solutions to the challenges presented by the current operating environment,” Fairfax said. A carriage fee Making Google, Facebook and Apple pay for news content that they push out in news feeds and on their own news services was floated by Rupert Murdoch in a statement on News Corp’s website in January. “There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism,” he said. “The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize ‘trusted’ publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,” he said. Others have echoed the call for digital platforms to pay up. Foxtel says in its submission to the ACCC: “Our ability to attract subscribers and advertisers, and in turn obtain a return on our investment in content, is being seriously undermined by platforms which host our content without our permission, make it available for free to our entire potential subscriber base, and use that content to attract advertisers away from our platform.” Nine put it this way: “A fundamental issue is that there is no equitable remuneration for the use of publisher content on digital platforms, and the digital platforms are extracting advertising dollars from the engagement with that content.” Exactly how a carriage fee would work is not clear. Google has partly acknowledged that it is benefiting from the journalistic effort of others, with its Google News Initiative. An algorithm review board News and others have backed an “algorithm review board” to investigate how Google prioritises news organisations in its search results and to ensure it is acting fairly. Search engines, like Google, use algorithms to decide the order they display links to web pages in a search. This is immensely important to media companies in generating traffic to their sites. The algorithms take into account several factors including relevance, the reputation of the page and popularity to decide who to rank higher. But it is not transparent and Google regularly makes changes to the algorithm, which are also not public. News Corp has claimed that Google downgrades companies that have paywalls on their material, something Google has disputed in its submissions. (News has hard paywalls on most of its masthead sites, but none on news.com.au.) Despite often railing against additional regulation, News Corp has proposed a review board to oversee the algorithms and make sure they are fair. Free TV has set out the type of information it believes Google and Facebook should be making public such as what causes upgrades and downgrades. It also wants one month’s notice of changes to the algorithms. Google told the ACCC: “Certain comments suggest that Google does not provide enough information about how its algorithms work. These comments do not recognise that Google is constantly engaged in finding the right balance between providing transparency about how search works while playing a cat and mouse game against sites that try to ‘game’ Google’s algorithms without providing any benefit to users.” Fairer regulation in relation to advertising and content From the free to air television industry’s perspective, the key changes the industry wants to see is some balancing up of the relatively heavy-handed regulation applying to television compared with the non-existent regulation of the digital platforms. Nine Entertainment Co, which has just taken over Fairfax, calls it “regulatory disparity”. “Nine is subject to strict regulatory requirements and licence conditions, including in relation to the standard and composition of its content, while the digital platforms prefer to be characterised as “tech companies” that do not have responsibility for the content they distribute, or require media regulation,” it says. In relation to advertising, for example, television, radio and pay TV are subject to an election advertising blackout three days before an election. Digital platforms are not, with the result that political parties direct a deluge of money into Google ads in the last days of the campaign. Once upon a time that money would have gone into print – but no more. In the days before the Wentworth byelection, anyone using Google search from their computer or phone in the Wentworth electorate, or searching a story about the byelection, was bombarded by ads for the Liberal candidate, Dave Sharma, or Kerryn Phelps, the independent. There are wildy different rules that apply on sensitive advertising like gambling ads. That doesn’t necessarily mean that free to air wants digital platforms to be subject to the same rules as them. They would be just as happy, perhaps, with a reduction in regulation across the board. The bigger issue of Australian content is arguably outside the scope of this ACCC inquiry, which said at the outset it was focussing on news and journalism. But it may be tempted. Most of the television networks and Foxtel have made reference to the free ride that digital streaming services such as Netflix, Stan and Amazon get under the Australian content rules. The screen industry wants the popular on-demand platforms to spend at least 10 per cent of their programming on Australian content. Currently, they have no requirement to spend on local programs, unlike the free-to-air networks which must meet local programming quotas, and pay TV, which must spend 10 per cent of its programming on local drama. Fast take-down mechanisms Another big gripe is that the digital platforms, particularly YouTube, are slow to act on requests from the networks and other copyright holders to remove material posted by users in breach of copyright. Free TV, the industry group, is arguing for a swift response mechanism when copyright is infringed. Verification of ad claims by digital platforms One of the other gripes of the existing media industry is that they are expected to make verifiable claims about the advertising reach of particular channels, publications or websites, but the digital platforms are not. The television industry funds OzTam which measures audiences. The digital platforms rely on their internal information to sell ads, which admittedly is more easily measured online. The ACCC report is expected this week. There will then be a second round of submissions before a final report comes out next year. The ACCC can potentially make orders about the structure of the industry if it considers there are serious breaches of the competition rules occurring. But issues such as Australian content rules would require legislation."

In the picture, taken at the Thanksgiving table, she was gripping a large turkey leg, her mouth open, her eyes, well, I don’t want to say rabid, but, not un-rabid, as she seemingly battled to get it in her mouth whole. She gave the impression of a person whose family had been killed by turkeys and, after embarking on a long and bloody journey of revenge, had murdered the turkey’s son and was eating his flesh as their village burned around her. I said yes. It was sweet of her to ask. The exchange, though, made me consider more closely one of today’s favourite anxieties: “sharenting”, the practice of posting pictures of your children online. Last week, it was alleged that American celebrities Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kim Kardashian (both of whom regularly post pictures of their children on the internet) appeared to have… enhanced recent photos of their daughters, aged four and five. Their stomachs had been slimmed, their skin had been smoothed, and it was claimed (by gotcha account @Celebface) that Zolciak-Biermann had changed the shape of her daughter’s nose, and lifted her buttocks. This isn’t the first time either has been accused of editing their kids, and though they posted them on Instagram (Kardashian with a picture of her baby with her head slightly shrunken, and Zolciak-Biermann with one of her twins slimmed down) both say they found the pictures already pre-Photoshopped online. And OK, this is the thin end of the wedge, but it’s a wedge that many of us straddle daily, taking picnics there, dangling our feet off the side and admiring the view. So (sexualisation of children and the passing on of body dysmorphia as if a beloved family heirloom aside, not a sentence I ever expected to write, but fine, onwards!) I can almost understand the impulse. When your career lives and dies on cartoon-like perfection, it makes sense that all images will thoughtlessly be Facetuned so the same rules apply, regardless of who’s in the picture. But of course, ripples ripple. That’s what they do. It’s perhaps more interesting to look at, rather than famous parents, those who have become famous through being parents – the “influencers” who have turned their families into brands. While they rarely edit their children to make their bodies look more attractive, it could be argued (in fact, screw it, I’m arguing) that the filter is irrelevant – the filter is in the choice of picture, of activity, of clothing and mood. While the famous Kims were accused of something that’s easy to condemn, it’s far trickier to unpick the edited world of a professional sharent, whose job success balances on a fine combination of monetised honesty about the effects of exhaustion, and well-lit interiors. Perhaps a puppy. And yet, I get it. There are few jobs that allow a parent to spend time with their child and also make loads of cash. It is monetised homemaking. But the idea that this job should be considered a glamorous one, something all parents should strive for, makes me slightly itchy. We’re yet to see the children of sharents grow up, but, whoo, that summer’s going to be a scorcher. In an Instagram post last Monday (since deleted), one mummy blogger wished her son a happy sixth birthday and invited followers to like his picture. It’s rare that a single Instagram caption so naively and accurately sticks a pin in where we are today – this intersection of technological unease and late-capitalist culture, this dystopian scramble. “Guys I am gonna be perfectly honest… Instagram never liked my Munchkin and it killed me inside. His photos never got as many likes. Never got comments. From a statistical point of view, he wasn’t as popular [as her other children] with everyone out there,” she wrote. Was it algorithm bias, she wondered, or that he had squinty eyes that was keeping him from success? And yet, she added: “One day he will see the numbers, and have to learn his value is not in online approval.” I imagined the dinner table meetings, a laptop with performance projections: “BE 40% CUTER THIS WEEK FREDERICK, OR NO YOUTUBE.” There is much we don’t know about the effect of broadcasting our kids, as we send our families off down the internet like canaries. But what’s clear, glancing at this week’s sharenting attempts, is that it’s not all about the picture: it’s about the intention of the person posting it. If a parent has edited the photo to make their audience believe in an unrealistic body or life, the child will likely learn their body or life is flawed. If a parent is putting it online to get likes, the child will see their job involves seeking validation from strangers. I’m suspicious of any advice to keep kids offline. Instead we should be looking at our own impulses and objectives, the things that propel our thumbs to share, because while we have no idea what privacy will look like in 10 years time, we know for sure our children are learning from our choices today. And if that involves showing them at war with a turkey leg, then so be it. One more thing… Having finally read Hanya Yanagihara’s first novel The People in the Trees, the memoirs of a fictional Nobel-prizewinning paedophile who discovers (thus decimating) the secrets of a Micronesian island tribe, I’ve been learning about the North Sentinel Island tribespeople who killed a trespassing missionary with fascination. For the past month, a small church in the Hague has been conducting round-the-clock services to protect an Armenian refugee family from deportation - by law, police in the Netherlands are not allowed to enter places of worship during religious services. If anything could convince me to pray… The fabulous Jameela Jamil tweeted about the dodgy ads for weight loss teas featuring stars such as Cardi B. All they do, she said, is ‘give you diarrhoea’. So she hopes ‘all these celebrities shit their pants in public’. Fun! Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman"

          "headline": "Study suggests rate of foetal alcohol syndrome disorder higher than thought",
          "bodyText": "Up to 17% of children could have the symptoms of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) because their mothers drank during pregnancy, according to a new study, whose findings were criticised for potentially causing pregnant women to panic and seek an abortion. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is diagnosed from a collection of mental and physical problems in a child, including some distinctive facial features, such as a small head, small eyes and a thin upper lip. It can be associated with learning difficulties and mood problems. Until now, it was estimated that between 2% and 5% of children in the UK had the disorder as a result of their mother’s alcohol intake while she was pregnant. The NHS says alcohol crosses the placenta to the growing baby, who cannot process it well, resulting in damage to cells in the brain and body. But the UK has one of the highest reported rates of drinking in pregnancy, at just over 40%, only exceeded by Ireland, Belarus and Denmark, leading some to question the prevalence figure. The new study, published in the journal Preventive Medicine, was carried out by researchers at Bristol and Cardiff Universities, looking into the records of nearly 13,500 children born in the 1990s whose families had signed up to a major, ongoing study. They developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with FASD. They found that 79% of mothers had drunk any alcohol at all when they were pregnant. Between 6% and 17% of the children in the study had symptoms, depending on the exact way in which the researchers did the screening. Dr Cheryl McQuire, researcher in epidemiology and alcohol-related outcomes at the University of Bristol, who led the research, said this sort of screening “is not the same as a formal diagnosis. “Nevertheless, the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and FASD-relevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that FASD is likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK.” It was important to have better figures, so that children affected could get the help they needed, she said. However, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) disputed the figures and warned that women who are pregnant could panic and consider abortion if the results were miscommunicated. “We advise real caution over the interpretation and communication of these findings,” said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the charity, which sees over 70,000 women each year for pregnancy counselling and abortion care. “This study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety. “Many women have drunk before finding out they are pregnant, and messaging around pregnancy drinking which overstates risk or distorts the available evidence can lead some women to consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy, or spend that pregnancy wracked with guilt and anxiety. This does not benefit anyone.” Campaigners welcomed the findings, however. “These figures should raise alarm bells throughout Westminster and wake up everyone in the NHS and the Department of Health, who for decades have been keeping their heads in the sand about this largely avoidable public health crisis,” said Sandra Butcher, chief executive of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK. She and other support groups hail the advice of the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, in 2016, who said it was safest for women who were pregnant or trying to conceive not to drink at all. But they said the government needs a strategy for diagnosing children and supporting the families. Dr Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said many cases remained undiagnosed and that screening studies of children are needed. “FASD remains the most common and potentially preventable cause of learning and behavioural difficulties in the world,” he said. “While we incorporated expert clinical judgment in our algorithm specification and validation process, it was not feasible to conduct individualised assessments of FASD.”"

          "bodyText": "Businesses using fingerprint scanners to monitor their workforce can legally sack employees who refuse to hand over biometric information on privacy grounds, the Fair Work Commission has ruled. The ruling, which will be appealed, was made in the case of Jeremy Lee, a Queensland sawmill worker who refused to comply with a new fingerprint scanning policy introduced at his work in Imbil, north of the Sunshine Coast, late last year. Fingerprint scanning was used to monitor the clock-on and clock-off times of about 150 sawmill workers at two sites and was preferred to swipe cards because it prevented workers from fraudulently signing in on behalf of their colleagues to mask absences. The company, Superior Woods, had no privacy policy covering workers and failed to comply with a requirement to properly notify individuals about how and why their data was being collected and used. The biometric data was stored on servers located off-site, in space leased from a third party. Lee argued the business had never sought its workers’ consent to use fingerprint scanning, and feared his biometric data would be accessed by unknown groups and individuals. “I am unwilling to consent to have my fingerprints scanned because I regard my biometric data as personal and private,” Lee wrote to his employer last November. “Information technology companies gather as much information/data on people as they can. “Whether they admit to it or not. (See Edward Snowden) Such information is used as currency between corporations.” Lee was neither antagonistic or belligerent in his refusals, according to evidence before the commission. He simply declined to have his fingerprints scanned and continued using a physical sign-in booklet to record his attendance. He had not missed a shift in more than three years. The employer warned him about his stance repeatedly, and claimed the fingerprint scanner did not actually record a fingerprint, but rather “a set of data measurements which is processed via an algorithm”. The employer told Lee there was no way the data could be “converted or used as a finger print”, and would only be used to link to his payroll number to his clock-on and clock-off time. It said the fingerprint scanners were also needed for workplace safety, to accurately identify which workers were on site in the event of an accident. Lee was given a final warning in January, and responded that he valued his job a “great deal” and wanted to find an alternative way to record his attendance. “I would love to continue to work for Superior Wood as it is a good, reliable place to work,” he wrote to his employer. “However, I do not consent to my biometric data being taken. The reason for writing this letter is to impress upon you that I am in earnest and hope there is a way we can negotiate a satisfactory outcome.” Lee was sacked in February, and lodged an unfair dismissal claim in the Fair Work Commission. He argued he was sacked for failing to comply with an unreasonable direction, because the fingerprint scanning was in breach of Australian privacy laws. His biometric information was sent to a separate corporate entity that was not his employer, Lee argued. His employer had no privacy policy in place at the time, and he argued it had failed to issue a privacy collection notice to its employees, as required by law. Lee argued the company had effectively breached the privacy of its 150 workers twice a day, every day since fingerprint scanning was introduced. But the unfair dismissal claim failed. The Fair Work Commission found the site attendance policy that Lee had breached was lawful. It found that although the company may have breached privacy laws, the site-attendance policy was not automatically rendered unlawful as it related to Lee. “While there may have been a breach of the Privacy Act relevant to the notice given to employees, the private and sensitive information was not collected and would never be collected relevant to Mr Lee because of his steadfast refusal,” the commission found. “The policy itself is not unlawful, simply the manner in which the employer went about trying to obtain consent may have constituted a breach of the Privacy Act.” Lee told Guardian Australia he planned to appeal. He said the ruling implied that Australians only owned their biometric data until an employer demanded it, at which point they could be sacked if they refused to consent. “My biometric data is inherently mine and inseparable from me,” Lee said. “My employer can’t demand it or sack me for refusing to give it.” “It’s not about this particular employer. Ownership to me means that I can refuse consent without being sacked.”"

          "bodyText": "This blog has wrapped up. We’ll have a story on the day’s developments very shortly. Thanks for reading. Facebook has said it has already investigated claims of Russian activity discussed during today’s hearing and found there was no concerns. Collins quoted an email seized from software company Six4Three alleging that a Facebook engineer had notified the company in October 2014 that Russian IP addresses were accessing “three billion data points a day” on the network. “If Russian IP addresses were pulling down a huge amount of data from the platform was that reported or was that just kept, as so often seems to be the case, within the family and not talked about,” he asked. Facebook’s Richard Allan said the claim was misleading and taken out of context. Facebook has now issued a statement confirming the issue was looked into and told the Guardian “the engineers who had flagged these initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity” And with that, Collins closes the committee, until 3:30, when it will take evidence from the information commissioner. And finally, Charlie Angus, Canada’s representative, brings up Facebook’s inflated video metrics, overstated for two years. “I would consider that corporate fraud, on a massive scale,” he says, “and the best fix is anti-trust. The simplest form of regulation would be to break facebook up, or treat it as a utility, so that we can all be sure that we’re counting metrics that are accurate or true. To allow you to gobble up all the competition is not good.” Allan says, “it depends on the problem we’re trying to solve,” and Angus counters that “the problem is Facebook, everything else is just a symptom.” Allan: “Unless you’re going to turn off the internet, I’m not sure people would be better off in doing without Facebook offering the services it’s spent 15 years perfecting how to offer.” France’s Morin-Desailly asks how Facebook can restore trust. Is Facebook prepared to re-found its economic model? Allan says that the company really will be sharing information with academics, in an attempt to help them prove that it’s trustworthy. He adds that, on the business model, it would be nice if the company could just charge people the cost of doing business, but that in practice people like to use things for free, and advertising is the best way to do that. Latvia’s Inese Lībiņa-Egnere asks how Facebook can help countries like Latvia, that face specific threats from Russia. Allan says that Facebook is partnering with the Atlantic Council, which monitors that sort of threat; and says that the company is extending its own language capabilities, because currently Facebook’s AIs don’t understand Latvian, and so can’t spot problems as they happen. “We need to move from this being an election issue to this being an all-year-round issue.” Brazil’s Alessandro Molon makes a brief statement, asking for internet companies and social media companies to work with governments to preserve democracy. He then asks what Facebook is doing to prevent improper manipulation of its algorithms to prevent illegal manipulation of elections. Allan cites a previous post by Zuckerberg, which says that Facebook is trying to stop its algorithm rewarding sensationalist content; and highlight’s Facebook’s partnership with third-party fact checkers, which sees content suppressed if it’s marked as false. Molon asks further about how anyone can be sure Facebook has deeper commitment to democracy than to profit, and again brings up WhatsApp, “which was widely used to spread manipulated content”. The service, he says, banned more than 100,000 accounts in Brazil during the election. Allan says “we are now building WhatsApp into our thinking around election integrity.” The company acquired WhatsApp four years ago. “There are some novel challenges to look at,” Allan says, but “we don’t think that sort of manipulative behaviour is in anyone’s interest.” Argentina’s Leopoldo Moreau asks his question in Spanish (and Allan briefly responds fluently, before asking for the translator to continue for the benefit of the committee), and asks why Facebook’s Argentinian office didn’t engage with the country’s parliament. Allan apologises (in English), and says that the company has a large presence in Argentina and that they should be engaging better. Moreau asks about WhatsApp campaigning: the company, wholly owned by Facebook, allows for encrypted communications that facebook cannot oversee. Allan says that WhatsApp is “intended as a person to person messaging service; it should not be used for spamming people.” The Argentinian delegation counters that WhatsApp does have business APIs, that do allow for bulk mailing. Allan says that “if shadowy companies are promising to circulate on WhatsApp information through lists of numbers, that should stop. We will be offering proper business communication, but that we can oversee.” “Where we were made aware of it, we did take action. We’re building WhatsApp into those election task forces I mentioned.” Singapore’s Pritam Singh asks if Facebook would be willing to remove a post that could be skewing an election if it were ordered to by the authorities, and Allan says it would be eager to, because it wants to work with authorities. Lijnen asks about Facebook’s tracking of users. “It may be that the EU decides to limit that, but it will have profound implications,” Allan says, on the ability of the publishing industry to advertise. For the data of non-users, Allan again repeats the two categories of data the company stores: log files of non-users, and contact data uploaded by users. Lijnen says that she thinks that’s not GDPR compliant, but Allan disagrees. Nele Lijnen from Belgium says that “sending your cat” is a Flemish expression meaning not showing up. Making Allan Mark Zuckerberg’s cat? Lijnen clarifies that Allan is merely sitting next to Zuckerberg’s cat. Julie Elliott asks how Facebook defines political advertising. Allan: “This is one of the areas where we would really appreciate a discussion with policymakers. At the moment, in the UK, we say if you’re talking about a party or a candidate, or an issue in front of the legislature.” Elliott asks how Facebook monitors that. Allan describes the current system, which requires people to register as political advertisers if they’re found running political adverts. Elliott asks what percentage of Facebook’s budget is being spent on this effort; Allan says it’s a major effort, but that he can’t tell the committee the percentage. Elliott asks “what other checks and balances” Facebook is applying to the money that is funding the advertising. Facebook gets the money from the person who is paying it, Alan says, but thinks that the best way to explore further up the chain is with regulators like the Electoral Commission. Singapore’s Edwin Tong asks about Facebook’s policy on hate speech, and quotes from a Mark Zuckerberg statement saying that the company has always taken down such content. Tong then brings up a post made in Sri Lanka, calling for the murder of Muslims. “It was put up at a time when there were significant tensions between Sri Lankan Muslims… that eventually resulted in a state of emergency. “In that context, wouldn’t such a post inflame tensions?” Allan agrees it would. Tong asks why, then, that post is not down. Allan says it should be, and that there must have been a mistake; Tong quotes from Facebook’s response, which says that no policy has been broken, and Allan repeats that it’s a mistake. “Would you agree that Facebook cannot be trusted to choose what goes on its platform,” Tong asks. Allan disagrees, and says “the best way to resolve this is a dictionary of hate speech terms in Sinhalese that gets surfaced to a Sinhalese reviewer.” “We make mistakes; our job is to reduce the number of mistakes. We should be accountable for our mistake to you and your colleagues, to every parliament that’s sat round the table today.” Sun asks if it’s possible that future elections will be interfered with through methods that will only be discovered after the fact. Allan says it’s possible, because “as long as we have an internet, it’s unreasonable to think that we’ll be able to stop all of this.” Would more be achieved, Sun asks, if Facebook works with relevant authorities to take down false content? Allan says he thinks its important to work within a judicial process: if someone claims a politician is false, he says, the best person to check is the judiciary of the country. Sun asks if he agrees that falsehoods can cause harm to society, and Allan says he does. Sun Xueling from Singapore asks how Facebook is policing the setting up and shutting down of fake accounts and their networks. “The shutting down of fake accounts is an ongoing battle that we have,” Allan says. “Most fake accounts are created with commercial intent … but they’re taken down within minutes. “Then there are people who are careful, create one or two accounts, and act as though they are a normal Facebook user. The issue in the US, with the Internet Research Agency, was that.” Allan says that “low-quality information” has reduced by over 50% on the site, according to a study from a French research institute. But, he says, those people who curate individual fake accounts are the hardest to catch. Zimmer quotes again from the New York Times story two weeks ago: “Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg stumbled … and sought to conceal warning signs from public view.” Allan says he doesn’t think that’s true. “Issues have come up, and been debated fully and thoroughly.” Zimmer notes that Facebook’s quarterly profit is $13bn. “What do you say to the 400 million constituents we represent that shows you’re taking this seriously? There are other bigger issues involving election campaigns … but you’re still downplaying the role that Facebook has in this situation. That’s a huge player on the global scene, and you still don’t seem to get a grasp on how much influence you have on global election campaigns.” Allan says: “We now have a world-leading security team, who are finding those people and taking them down. We tell you, and you ask how did they get on the site. There will be problems, but we will catch most of them, and our goal is that the Canadian elections should not be unduly influenced through online activity on our platform.” Canada’s Bob Zimmer asks whether Allan thinks Canada’s democracy is at risk if the country doesn’t change its laws to deal with ‘surveillance capitalism’. Allan says there are a number of vectors that are problematic: foreign interference, the ability for others to project their views into the country; but also domestic issues, allowing people inside the country to do dirty tricks campaigns. After a brief interruption from Ireland’s Eamon Ryan, and a quip about missing his gavel from Zimmer, the Canadian asks about Zuckerberg’s dismissal of the idea that Facebook affected the US election as a “crazy idea”. Allan concedes it was “not elegantly said”, but says that “in an election campaign there is a huge amount of legitimate activity carried out by all the parties … We did spot this activity that was wrong, shouldn’t have happened, but we think that if you look at what changed the outcome, it’s the main point.” “They’re both problems, but if you ask my why that statement was made, I’m trying to describe to you the thinking behind it.” The UK’s Brendan O’Hara reiterates the irritation with Facebook’s decision not to send Zuckerberg, and asks if Allan was sent to answer questions or defend the company. “Were you sent because you, in the entire Facebook empire, are the best person to answer all these questions, or because you’re best placed to defend the company?” Allan says he thinks it’s the former, and reminds O’Hara that Mike Schroepfer, the company’s chief technical officer, had previously come and not satisfied the committee. He says he volunteered to speak to the committee: “I said, ‘I believe that I have the knowledge that this group needs.’” “To be precise, both for the issues that you want to raise as the UK commitee, and, I now work on election issues globally… this is the stuff I work on. Our working assumption was that’s what you want to discuss.” O’Hara complains about how many times Allan is promising to write with answers after the commitee, and asks Allan what light he thinks he’s shone on the issue that has provided greater clarity than Zuckerberg could have. “I think I’ve given you insights around the way we think about regulation–” he is cut off by Collins, who hands over to the next questioner. Pow turns to Facebook’s decision to challenge a £500,000 fine from the Information Commissioner’s Office. Allan says there’s a problem about how you assign blame between a first party and a third party in the case of a breach here. “Some of the language here suggests that if I have an email, and share it with a third party, that that could be a breach. That’s the sort of question we have to answer.” Pow suggests that the appeal shows that Facebook actually doesn’t like regulation. Allan says “we are pleased about the right kind of regulation. Let’s get to the point where you agree that we’re doing the right kind of job, and can hold us to account if we’re not.” POw says it feels like Facebook priortised its business and the value of its shares over public safety. Allan says: “We have a mission. We want our service to be good, to be useful and to be safe.” Pow cites Allan’s claim that the Facebook platform was “win win win,” and says it now seems to be “lose lose lose”. Allan says that that’s only true for a small set of specific issues. Pow: “Mr Zuckerberg said that much of the criticism of Facebook over the last 18 months had been fair and important; would you agree with that?” Allan: “Yes.” Pow: “But in another article, he said that much of the criticism had been untrue and unfair.” Allan says that some specific points are “quite personal attacks, which we don’t recognise. I work with these people, and I don’t recognise the mischaracterisation of these individuals.” The plummeting trust in the company is, he says “a major concern. We recognise that we’re not in a good place in terms of trust.” The UK’s Rebecca Pow next, who wants to make some “quite general points”. She cites a New York Times article saying that Facebook “ignored warning signs” about the negative impacts of its social network. Allan says “the article mischaracterised discussions and people over the last few years. We are careful about how we release public information, about how they land. There’s no point in releasing security information if everyone’s going to declare it as partisan and dismiss it.” Canada’s Nathaniel Eskine-Smith quotes from Zuckerberg’s statement apologising for Facebook’s failures, and notes that he wasn’t sorry enough to show up. He then reels off a list of specific failures, from enabling the Rohingya genocide to allowing people to advertise to white supremacists and asks Allan if Facebook would do differently today. He then follows up by asking if those failures were malicious or negligence. Allan isn’t happy with the binary. Erskine-Smith then begins to ask questions that seem drawn from the Six4Three emails: did Facebook limit API access to apps that buy mobile adverts; did Mark Zuckerberg ever cancel an announcement to implement API restrictions. Allan begins to protest that the questions are based on the emails, but both Erskine-Smith and Collins deny that any of the contents of the Six4Three emails were shared outside the DCMS committee. Allan then says he doesn’t know the answers, and Erskine-Smith argues that Mark Zuckerberg would, which is why he should have shown up. Erskine-Smith then asks whether Allan believes a user’s failure to uncheck a box about sharing data with app developers counts as “meaningful consent” under Canadian law; Allan says he does, prompting a laugh from Erskine-Smith. Ireland’s Hildegarde Naughton asks about Facebook’s advertising ban during the country’s abortion referendum. “We’re not comfortable making that decision”, Allan says, but when there’s no clear laws, sometimes the company is forced to act. The concern, he says, is that there was political interference from overseas. Naughton brings up two private member’s bills running through Ireland’s parliament, and asks if Allan accepts that Facebook needs to be regulated. “Yes,” he says. “Many of the laws on political advertising were drafted pre-internet. We’ve seen many interesting developments; in Brazil, for instance, the responsibility is put on the political actor, so that they can only use services with transparency tools. To the extent that this is all clarified, and we have a simple playbook, that would be extraordinarily helpful.” “I have now tens of thousands of colleagues who are deeply committed to protecting the safety of our users. The best way that we can ensure safety is when we’re able to be very open about the problems we’re seeing; some of the problems are on our platform, and we can just throw them off, but some of them need regulation. If someone’s a threat to children, for instance, we don’t want to throw them off the platform and have them go somewhere else.” Farrelly turns to “Mainstream Network”, which was running adverts opposing the Chequers deal. Allan says the company has stopped running those adverts, but adds that “as of this week, any company that wants to run ads like that will have to provide a disclaimer saying how it’s funded”. (That’s the first public confirmation of when Facebook is planning on launching the second half of its transparency tools in the UK, which were delayed earlier this month.) Farrelly suggests that the Six4Three emails – which we still haven’t seen – show that Facebook is potentially breaching the US Rico act, which is intended to crack down on organised crime. He asks if Facebook has ever taken advice on how to defend against a Rico case. Allan says it has not, and that such a comparison is unfair. Farrelly asks if it’s fair to ask what Facebook has to hide. Allan: “I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to share all our discussions with the public… in terms of what we did, we’ve got nothing to hide, in terms of all our internal discussions, having those treated as our company’s positions, I don’t think that’s fair.” The UK’s Paul Farrelly again turns to Six4Three. “What’s their beef with you?” Allan: “Their beef rests on us making the changes that you all want us to change. When we changed the API, they lost access to the friends data, and they launched a series of lawsuits. “Their app – I was not a user – promised to help you find photos of your friends wearing bikinis.” Farrelly notes that it’s “ironic”, because of the way Facebook started (as a website allowing users to compare the hotness of Harvard students). Allan notes the irony, but points out that “Facemash” did not include bikini pictures. Allan says that the change in API terms happened around the time that Facebook transferred to being a mobile-focused company from being a website, and that that explains some emails apparently contained in the seized Six4Three cache. “All companies at that time discussed what the new business models look like … I suspect you may have, in the record, some partial discussions about potential new business models.” Clive Efford asks Allan about his joint role as a member of the House of Lords, and how it looks that he’s making excuses for Zuckerberg’s failure to show. “Not good,” Allan admits. “But I also have a role supporting my company as it tries to grapple with the issues it faces today. I am proud of the fact that we have answered thousands of questions and appeared in front of many committee hearings around the world.” Efford asks Allan to describe the founding principles of the Facebook platform. Allan says that the company’s 2 billion users are better served by allowing third-party developers to provide services to those users that Facebook itself won’t build. Efford asks about “PS12N”, a term that Allan doesn’t recognise. Efford says it “seems to have been a way of selecting which apps can access which services on the API.” Allan describes the platform as being open-access, but offering particular status to those big brands that can bring special value to the site. “There are people who show up, meet the terms and conditions, sign up, and are allowed on the platform. Then there are large companies, who may have specific terms, but provide services that are more valuable than the run of the mill service, and may also have more infrastructure. They are, for instance, companies that themselves have significant data protection infrastructure, and can thus be trusted to hold data.” Efford asks if one of those new requirements is the ability to buy large amounts of mobile advertising; Allan says it was not. Efford asks further whether Facebook has ever targeted a developer to close down its operations so that Facebook can move in to that area and make money; Allan again denies it. Efford says that this shows that the committee needs to speak to Zuckerberg, because Allan doesn’t know enough about these decisions. Stevens turns to the non-user data Facebook holds. Allan: “I’ve uploaded contact data; when a non-user joins the platform, that lets them be recommended to their friends. “We also keep a log of where people come to us from, that helps us [with] security.” Allan says Facebook makes no money from that data, because no adverts are served on it. The UK’s Jo Stevens asks about November 2009, when Facebook had a “central privacy page”, that let users “control who sees you profile and personal information”. That was the basis of a 2012 Federal Trade Commission complaint, which alleged that developers were given access to information beyond those controls. Allan: “My understanding of the FTC settlement is that it objected to the idea that data may have been accessed without consent, without permission. We were confident that the controls we implemented did count as consent. “The notion at the time was something like a calendar with your friends’ birthdays on would be useful as a third-party application; that would require access to the birthdays of your friends. The idea behind this was not malicious, it was intended to add value.” Stevens: “If I set my own custom privacy settings, that didn’t matter, because Facebook just overrode them?” Allan: “No, because there was a separate setting that allowed users to opt-out of sharing their information with developers.” Ryan finally asks whether Facebook is still applying GDPR around the world, and Allan says that it is. Ryan brings up Facebook’s new transparency tools around political advertising, now launched in the US, UK and Brazil. “Why can we not have such transparency immediately, now?” Allan says the company has a team working on deployment now. “There are three elements. The first is that you can go to a page now and see all ads being run. Second is authorisation, that’s where we check that you live in the country – ‘know your customer’. The third is an ad archive: if you run ads as a political advertiser, they go in the archive. “That’s challenging; doing the authorisation is difficult. And then, for the archives, one of the things you need is for people to declare who they are, who they’re campaigning for. We found people tried to game the system, putting false information in, so we built up a team checking the information.” Ireland’s Eamon Ryan asks: “The Irish data protection commissioner in 2012 was looking for an end to the possibility of developers accessing friends’ data. They considered taking a legal challenge, but said they thought it would take too long. We didn’t get a clear answer why Facebook decided to fight that recommendation. Where was that decision made? By whom in the company? And in 2015, when this misuse was discovered, at what level was it decided not to notify the Irish data protection commission?” Allan says the view was that Ireland was giving “strong advice” but not declaring it “illegal”; “there was a view that the platform was working well at the time … and so the decision was taken with the data protection team to say ‘if we’re not compelled to make this change, we’re not going to make this change’”. Ryan asks whether the decision was made in Europe or California; Allan says it was made by Facebook Ireland. France’s Catherine Morin-Desailly asks Allan to “repeat Facebook’s decision on access controls that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal”. Allan says that Facebook’s platform, which dates back to 2007, was used by Aleksandr Kogan to gather data from a large number of people. Morin-Desailly asks whether users were warned; Allan concedes it is a matter for debate but says Facebook believes they were given sufficient notice, but says that the specific usage of the data was abusive. “It was something that we do believe people were aware of at the time.” Morin-Desailly turns to “shadow profiles”, Facebook’s apparent policy of creating profiles for non-users. Allan denies creating such profiles: “there are not shadow profiles, there is a certain amount of non-user data that sits on Facebook servers. That can come from two sources: if you upload your contacts, that sits on our servers; and there is a certain amount of data that comes from browsing the web with sites that have Facebook plugins.” Collins moves on, asking if Facebook created a “whitelist” of developers that continued to have full access to user data after the company changed its policy in 2014. Allan explains that “some developers needed additional time, and we gave them that time where we thought it was justified”. “When somebody had chosen to install an application under version one [of the terms], they could choose to give access to broader data. The API was never like a ‘firehose’ of data … If you agreed to it, and agreed to certain permissions, developers could access some friends’ data; in version two, that access was removed.” Collins asks if Facebook had a reciprocity agreement, offering access to its data if they gave their own data back. Allan says that this only meant that Facebook developers had to offer the ability to users to share content back to Facebook. “Otherwise it’s simply taking data out, extractive, there’s no value back to the Facebook community.” Collins says Facebook has a “consistent pattern” of failing to disclose relevant information to public hearings, citing, the fact that the company didn’t tell parliament about Russian activity when it asked, leaving parliament to find out through media reports. Allan: “Once we’ve investigated, and confirmed, such reports, we publish them. Over the last few months, we’ve published several reports about attempts by Russian and Iranian operatives to spread false information on Facebook.” Collins brings up the Six4Three documents that parliament has received, but says that “we don’t intend to publish them today”. He does, however, quote from them a claim that Facebook had discovered in 2013 that a Russian entity had been pulling information from the site using an API. He asks if that is true, but Allan responds by attacking Six4Three as a “hostile litigant”. Collins again asks what Facebook actually did about that breach, and whether it had reported it. Allan says the information is “at best partial”, but says he will “come back to” Collins about whether Facebook actually knew about Russian activity. The DCMS committee has released an image of Mark Zuckerberg’s empty chair, just to hammer home the CEO’s absence. Allan argues that the intention of Facebook with its app platform is to provide a “win win win”: Facebook gets more features for free, Facebook users get to do things that Facebook doesn’t normally provide, and developers get access to a large customer base. Lucas again asks for one specific example of a business banned by Facebook for sharing information, and again Allan cannot provide one, but promises to do so after. If you want to watch the hearing yourself, you can see it here: Lucas turns to Joseph Chancellor, a co-founder of GSR (the Cambridge University affiliated firm that provided Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica) and former employee of Facebook. He asks what action Facebook took against Chancellor, and Allan says he is not aware of any action. “Isn’t it true you don’t take any action against developers,” asks Lucas. Allan says “we will prevent access to our platform” for any apps that breach its terms, but Lucas again says there are no specific examples. Next up is the UK’s Ian Lucas, who asks whether Facebook first learned about the GSR data incident (the root of the Cambridge Analytica scandal) from the press in 2015. Allan says he, at least, learned about it then, and that he believes that Zuckerberg did not discover it then. But Lucas pushes for a precise answer. Allan: “We have provided written answers; my belief is that it was in March 2018, when this round of stories was published, that he learned about them.” Lucas asks for other apps that were banned. Allan cannot name a specific app, and promises to follow up with a written answer; Lucas notes that that promise was also made by Zuckerberg in front of the US Congress, but that no such written answer was provided. “We still do not know any company that was banned by Facebook on that basis.” Angus brings up the fact that Facebook hired Washington DC political consultants Definers, who smeared Facebook critics as members of a George Soros-funded conspiracy to take down the site. Allan: “I”m not going to disagree with you that we’ve damaged public trust with some of the actions we’ve taken. Mr Zuckerberg said himself that was not what he expected of us; Elliot Schrage said he was publicly responsible, and Mr Zuckerberg has given us instructions to look at all relationships we have.” Angus says he’s not asking Facebook to be “perfect”, but to be “accountable.” “Once again, ‘Mr Zuckerberg is looking into this’; we don’t know that he is, because he’s refusing to show up to parliaments around the world.” Collins turns to Canada’s Charlie Angus, who says he is “deeply disappointed” at Zuckerberg’s decision to “blow off this meeting”, and asks Allan “who gave Mr Zuckerberg the advice to ignore this committee.” Allan: “Our intent is to be there to answer the questions you have of us,” but that doesn’t always involve Zuckerberg. Angus: “Mr Zuckerberg’s decision to not appear here speaks volumes … when he says that the plan was, to move fast and break things, and that breaking may have involved our democratic institutions, does he not think or not believe that parliamentarians will push back?” Allan: “As we sit here today, there are reviews of Facebook’s engineering product going on that he is leading.” We’re off! Collins proudly proclaims this as the first time the House of Commons has held such a multi-parliament hearing since 1933. “This shows just how seriously we take these issues, as do our colleagues from other parliaments.” Richard Allan is sat next to an empty chair set for Mark Zuckerberg. “We were rather hoping your boss would appear,” Collins says. Naturally, representatives from other parliaments can’t sit on a British parliamentary committee, so they appear to have instead been recorded as witnesses. Appearing are: Leopoldo Moreau, chair, Freedom of Expression Commission, Chamber of Deputies, Argentina. Alessandro Molon, member of the Chamber of Deputies, Brazil. Bob Zimmer, chair, and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Charlie Angus, vice-chairs, standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics, House of Commons, Canada. Hildegarde Naughton, chair, and Eamon Ryan, member, joint committee on communications, climate action and environment, parliament of Ireland. Dr Inese Lībiņa-Egnere, deputy speaker, parliament of Latvia. Pritam Singh, Edwin Tong and Sun Xuelin, members, select committee on deliberate online falsehoods, parliament of Singapore. Karine Lalieux, hair, committee on infrastructure, communications and public enterprises, parliament of Belgium. Catherine Morin-Desailly, standing committee on culture, education and media, French Senate. And representing Facebook: Richard Allan, vice president of policy solutions. Correction: Belgium is represented by Nele Lijnen, not Karine Lalieux. Chaired by Damian Collins MP, the head of the UK parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee, the “grand committee” also includes representatives from Singapore, Brazil, Argentina, Ireland, Canada, Belgium, France and Latvia. It is expected to open with a bang, thanks to a cache of documents seized by Collins at the weekend from Six4Three, a US-based app developer that is suing the social network in California. Six4Three had obtained the documents as part of the legal discovery process, but they were sealed under a court order. Collins invoked a rarely used parliamentary power to compel Six4Three’s founder, who was in the UK for business purposes, to hand over the information anyway. “This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation,” Collins told the Observer on Sunday. “We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest.” Today, a “grand committee” comprised of representatives from nine parliaments around the world is due to face Facebook, holding the company to account for its failure to police its own platform in nations as diverse as Singapore, France and Brazil. The company is represented in the hearings, which kick off at 11.30am, by its European policy chief, Richard Allan, after Facebook declined repeated requests to send its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. Allan is no stranger to the British parliament: he’s a member of the House of Lords, as Lord Allan of Hallam, and was the Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam before then. Curiously, Allan’s successor as Sheffield Hallam MP was Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now, again, Allan’s boss as the new head of Facebook’s worldwide communications."

          "headline": "The Ex-Boyfriend Yard Sale: can you put a price on sentimental value?",
          "bodyText": "Imagine an episode of The Antiques Roadshow where the objects are all gifts from your old partners and a price is put on their sentimental value. What might that faded T-shirt or once-loved mixtape be worth in cash terms? In her performance The Ex-Boyfriend Yard Sale, currently at Camden People’s theatre in London, Haley McGee invites audiences to evaluate several presents from her exes. A coffeepot, a vintage typewriter, a guitar and a necklace are among the items displayed on plinths on the stage. When McGee reveals more intimate information about each relationship, we raise or lower our valuations accordingly. It all starts to feel like an alarmingly personal version of The Price Is Right. The show, McGee says, was partly inspired by a £10,000 Visa bill she needed to clear after she moved to the UK from Canada. Looking around her home, she wondered what she could earn from selling off the old gifts and asked herself how much they meant to her and whether she could create a kind of algorithm to measure sentimental value. Working with mathematician Melanie Phillips, who also makes interactive games, she established a dizzyingly complex formula that is outlined in the show. Part of the formula, the “relationship index”, measures her time with each ex on a scale of one to 10, including “how hard they made you laugh, the ratio of fun-to-misery and how good the sex was”. There was one caveat: the number seven was not allowed because it was deemed a non-committal, “copout” number, she says, quoting the self-help author Tim Ferriss. The audience’s perception of how much each item is worth is affected by other details that McGee shares such as how long the relationship lasted, who broke up with who, and how long it took her to get over it. When she reads from her teenage diary, it makes us re-evaluate an object in a new light. Along the way McGee asks a host of intriguing questions about emotions and economics. Why should tradition dictate that an engagement ring cost three months’ salary? At one point she uses a sticker gun to put a price on her face and sits on a plinth herself. She later wraps herself up as a precious object in a scene involving several metres of bubblewrap, some elaborate choreography and a Tom Waits song. When making the show, McGee got in touch with each of the exes. “I was mostly very moved by how open and generous they were,” she recalls. “I hadn’t really talked to some of them for a long time … A lot of them thought it was a cool idea and were supportive of it. One or two were less impressed and thought it was silly or self-indulgent.” In the show, we hear snippets of her interviews with past boyfriends and, gradually, some of the objects are anthropomorphised. The coffeepot’s lid becomes a mouth and we start to attribute certain characteristics to each boyfriend based on the look and feel of the objects. The identity of each ex is protected and they are referred to by the name of the item. It’s a way of “being a little bit cheeky and reducing them to an object”, she explains. “I tried to have pseudonyms for them but then some of my exes chose their pseudonyms. Typewriter wanted to call himself Perry and Bicycle wanted to call himself Gary.” A couple of her old boyfriends donated to McGee’s crowdfunding campaign but none of them have watched the show yet. Bizarrely, one of her exes’ other exes has already been to see it. McGee describes herself as a “third-generation yard-show aficionado” and says her mother, a molecular biologist, “forced me to take maths until I was 18 because she thought it was very important”. But she says she doesn’t have an intuitive feel for numbers. “I’m a pretty emotional person, so using logic for the first time to look at feelings of worthlessness was really compelling.” The show charts how love and money intersect on various scales. In one episode, a grumble about splitting a bill for brunch seems to become a barometer for a failing relationship. McGee says that, in an earlier draft, she was also interested in “the way that money can be used as a weapon at the end of a relationship”, such as in a divorce. A previous incarnation of the show, staged in a space at Euston Station, which is near Camden People’s theatre, was an installation that McGee imagined as an “art gallery, auction house and yard sale smashed into each other”. Visitors listened to interviews with her exes and answered questions about their own relationships. As part of the project she crowdsourced a list of songs that people listened to on repeat after a break-up. The playlist – available online – is 472 songs long and growing. The Ex-Boyfriend Yard Sale reveals McGee to be a funny and assured performer and it’s easy to imagine her hosting a popular television version of the show. She has several ideas on how to develop that; meanwhile, her stage version includes a salient figure about art and economics. In one of her many calculations scrawled on the wall of the theatre she reveals that the show designed to clear a £10,000 debt has so far made a loss of £7,627. • The Ex-Boyfriend Yard Sale is at Camden People’s theatre, London, until 8 December."

          "headline": "Who is the real Nigel Farage... and why won't he answer my questions?",
          "bodyText": "The first time I call Nigel Farage live on air on his LBC radio show, I give my real name. It’s Sunday 10 June 2018, the day the Observer reports that Arron Banks, the main funder of Farage’s Leave.EU campaign, had not one (as he had claimed), but several meetings with the Russian ambassador in the run-up to the EU referendum. “What do you want to say to Nigel?” the producer asks. “I want to talk about how the funder of his campaign has systematically lied about his relationship with the Russian government,” I say. “I can’t put you through,” the producer says, an edge of panic in her voice. “Come on,” I say. “You’re a journalist. You know these are important questions. “I’m standing in,” she says. “I’m not the usual producer.” She promises to speak to her editor and call me back. No one calls me back. Two days later, I try again. Banks and his business partner Andy Wigmore, the spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign, are on the show to “answer questions”. It’s an interview in the best traditions of a Stalinist show trial – the man asking them the questions is the man whose campaign they funded – but even so, they sound spooked. It’s the only occasion in my time of reporting on them that I’ve heard them so subdued and serious. There’s never been an issue with me discussing Farage on other LBC shows such as James O’Brien’s, but, again, I can’t get through. Minutes later, a friend does, and passes me the phone. Actually, I say, just as Farage has built up a head of steam about the Trump-Russia “witch hunt”, it’s Carole Cadwalladr from the Guardian and Observer. “I don’t want to talk to Carole Cadwalladr of the Guardian!” Farage says. In the video of the moment, you can see him frantically motioning his producer with his eyes. The phone line is cut. Nigel Farage is so regularly on our airwaves and quoted in the press, but he is rarely held to account. At this point I’ve been writing about him for almost two years, and I have no way of asking him questions. His PR man almost never responds to messages. Doesn’t respond to interview requests. And then on 7 September this year we finally meet. He’s on tour with a one-man show entitled An Entertaining Evening With Nigel Farage, which has just landed – somewhat bizarrely – in Melbourne, Australia. Everything is a bit different here. The day before the event, I receive a notification of a change of venue (were ticket sales perhaps not what Farage might have hoped?). The event has been moved from a mid-sized arena to the conference room of a city centre hotel. What’s more, to get in, I have to fight my way through what feels like a running street battle. In Melbourne, Farage isn’t known as the Ukip man off the radio and telly. “He’s Donald Trump’s fascist sidekick and we don’t want his type here,” claims one of the protesters. He’s holding a placard that depicts Farage as a pig. Inside, it’s different. The audience – overwhelmingly male, surprisingly young – laps up his well-rehearsed bonhomie. And afterwards, for an extra A$200 on my ticket fee, I get to hang out backstage with a select crowd drinking bad white wine. And then, here he is. Hello, Nigel, I say, and introduce myself. He blinks. But, he doesn’t flee for the exit. Not straight away. It’s been frustrating, I say, because I’ve just wanted to ask you some direct questions. Will you do a proper interview with me? “Well, I don’t know!” he says, with a flash of the trademark Farage charm. “Maybe. It depends what mood I’m in. I don’t work for you. I don’t have to do it, do I?” No, I say, but you’re a public figure. You’re funded by taxpayers. The European Union funds you. We pay taxes that pay for you. “Well, who funds you?” he says. “The Observer funds me,” I say. “George Soros, is it?” I can’t quite believe that he’s said this, apparently in all seriousness. Banks has also accused me of being funded by Soros. And I’ve heard Farage using the phrase in the European parliament. It’s a reference to George Soros, the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist, who after the fall of communism, funded democracy-building institutions and movements across eastern Europe. He became a hate figure to the Russian government, who launched a propaganda campaign portraying him as a meddling Jewish banker. What “funded by Soros” really means is: “funded by Jews”. It signals antisemitism to an audience without saying it directly. But the only audience is me. I’m gobsmacked. Could he actually believe this stuff? “George Soros doesn’t fund me!” I say. “How could George Soros fund me?” “Well I don’t know!” Farage says. “You think the Russians fund me!” And then his minder appears. I have moments to put my question, the question that kicked it all off. Why did you visit Julian Assange? I say in a hurry. “LBC organised that,” he says. “You seem to be so stuck in your sad little world. They sent me. LBC wanted the interview. You can’t seem to get that into your mind. Why would my press officer, I mean my producer, come with me?” And then he’s gone. It’s the briefest of brief encounters and yet our exchange is so instructive. Because from the Kremlin, “Soros” as a political smear spread to the likes of Hungary’s demagogue-in-training, Viktor Orbán, and was picked up a year ago by Farage. When the Electoral Commission opened an investigation into the sources of Arron Banks’s funding a year ago, Farage made a speech in the European parliament in which he blamed this development on Soros. “This is where the real international political collusion is.” From Britain, it leapfrogged to the US, where it’s been deployed by Trump supporters about the “caravans” of immigrants heading for the US border with Mexico. Last week, it descended to the final circle of this hell: Facebook. The New York Times reported that after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook hired a right-leaning opposition research firm who used accusations of “Soros funding” to smear the company’s critics. In a way, the anti-Soros propaganda illuminates everything I’ve been trying to understand about Farage’s place in today’s world: that he represents a bridge between the authoritarian far right parties of central and eastern Europe that are aligned with Russia, and Trump’s America. It all feels a long way from West Kent golf club and the undulating greens outside Farage’s childhood home. His autobiography describes his time at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982 (he left the public school with few if any O-levels – accounts vary), and how a meeting at the golf club led to his first job as a commodities trader on the London Metal Exchange with a minor City firm. For years, this has been the image that Farage has cultivated. The tweed jackets. The pints. The Little Englander who lived modestly in a Kent suburban home and spoke to Britain’s G&amp;T belt. Even in 2014, he said in an interview that he realised he must reach beyond his core base, which he describes as “very middle class, very below the M4, ex-military”. This is no longer Farage’s world. He left that world far behind some time ago. But there’s a time lag in Britain in understanding this. In understanding Farage’s relationships with the European far right. And in understanding that he’s using the same playbook as the Kremlin, Steve Bannon (Donald Trump’s former chief strategist) and Robert Mercer, who for a long time funded Bannon’s pet projects, including alt-right news site Breitbart, and Cambridge Analytica. Here in the UK, Farage is still cosy Mr Brexit. He’s been touring the country running “Leave Means Leave” rallies – I went to one in a retail park in Bolton – where talk of medicine running out and lorries backed up on the motorway was denounced as yet more “Project Fear”. He’s the man who holds fast to an ideologically pure Brexit vision untainted by the realpolitik of Theresa May’s compromises. The man who broadcasts live on LBC five times a week and pops up on the BBC. Critically, in Britain, where political coverage follows the beat of Westminster’s drum, we have yet to really catch up with Farage’s uncomfortable new position: in overlapping circles radiating from US special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Could this be why Farage is avoiding me? He has refused to answer my questions for more than 18 months, since I wrote a report for the Observer – headlined When Nigel Farage met Julian Assange – published on 23 April last year. It posed a series of questions to which there are still no clear answers. Questions that, it’s become increasingly clear, cover some of the same territory that Mueller is circling. Farage was caught tripping down the steps of the Ecuadorean embassy by a reporter from BuzzFeed. “Nigel Farage just visited the Ecuadorean embassy in London,” the headline said. And the story said: “Asked by BuzzFeed News if he’d been visiting Julian Assange, the former Ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building.” The visit had come shortly after Farage had visited Donald Trump in Washington. BuzzFeed’s story involved three individuals, Trump, Assange and Farage, who were at the centre of the political storms that had changed the world in 2016 and raised a new set of questions. Last week, 20 months after Farage’s meeting with Assange, LBC issued a statement about it: “It was an exploratory meeting to discuss the possibility of an interview for the station. This preliminary meeting amounted to nothing, which is why LBC has not previously commented on the context in which the meeting took place as this would not be customary. Whilst Nigel Farage attended the meeting, it was not set up at his instigation.” It was the timings around the visit that raised questions. Farage left the embassy around noon. BuzzFeed’s story appeared at 1.31pm. At 2.28pm WikiLeaks made an announcement: it would host a live press conference with Assange about his latest leak, “Vault 7”, about mass CIA surveillance. This was during a week when things had started to look serious for Trump. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general, had been caught lying under oath about two meetings with the Russian ambassador and recused himself from the Russia inquiry. The “Vault 7” story , which landed US tech companies in the middle of CIA cyber-espionage, erupted on to the news cycle. It blew Russia off the front pages. Later, in June 2017, the Guardian reported that Farage was a “person of interest” to the FBI. Last week Farage told the Sunday Times he had not spoken to Mueller’s team: “I’ve done nothing wrong, so why would I worry about it? I mean, it’s very funny, deranged.” We don’t know if Farage is involved in the Russian intelligence operation that Mueller is so painstakingly unpicking. The investigation is in lockdown. But we know almost certainly that Assange is involved. An FBI indictment unsealed on 13 July said that at the heart of Russia’s operation to subvert the US presidential election is “Organization 1”, widely reported to be WikiLeaks. It’s Mueller who’s identified this. It’s the FBI indictments that reveal that so many strands of the investigation run through London. The third time I call Farage at LBC is 1 November 2018, the day Arron Banks is referred to the National Crime Agency because the Electoral Commission had decided it can’t be sure of the source of Banks’s multimillion-pound donation to Farage’s Leave.EU campaign. Or even that it came from Britain. This time I’m “Claire from Ashford, Kent”. I’ve been thinking about Remembrance Sunday, I tell Farage. “It’s a real time to feel patriotic about our laws and sovereignty,” I say. “It certainly is,” says Farage. “It’s why I’m so concerned about these reports about not knowing where Arron Banks’s money comes from,” I say. “I’m not discussing spending in the referendum here and now, Claire!” says Farage. The line goes dead. Who is Nigel Farage? It’s no longer clear. When I Google “Nigel Farage” and “Soros”, I end up watching a video on the far-right conspiracy theory website InfoWars, in which Farage is being interviewed by its founder, Alex Jones. InfoWars Farage is very far from LBC Farage – even though the video is shot inside LBC’s studio, with the LBC logo behind him. This Farage talks about our shared “Judeo-Christian culture”. (Words not often heard, I can’t help thinking, in West Kent golf club.) This is Steve Bannon’s language. The language of “globalists” and what Bannon pitches as an all-out war against the “elites”, an all-out war he’s now bringing to Europe with his latest project, a pan-European far-right coalition that he calls the Movement. “Farage has always followed the money,” a Ukip insider, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells me. “He knows which side his bread is buttered. When the US alt-right and evangelicals started supporting him, he became just like them.” And when I ask Greg Lance-Watkins, another key ex-Ukiper, how he’d describe his ideology he says: “Farage’s ideology is Farage.” In the 90s, Lance-Watkins used to advise Farage before his Question Time appearances. “He’s scared of the trick question. That’s why he won’t speak to you. “He’s scared of you, because you confuse him. It’s like the old adage, don’t ask a question you don’t know the answer to. He doesn’t know what answer you’re looking for.” But then neither do I. It’s not until I sit through An Entertaining Evening With Nigel Farage in Melbourne that I realise he’s not just a seven-times failed UK parliamentary candidate, but a bona fide YouTube star. “I wouldn’t be where I am today without YouTube,” Farage tells his audience of young men. Men who, when I ask, what do you think of Nigel Farage, say: “He’s an absolute legend.” Or: “He’s the dog’s bollocks.” How did you come across him, I ask, Alex, a programmer who lives locally? “On YouTube. I was watching a Jordan Peterson video. He was recommended to me.” It’s an eye-opening moment. Jordan Peterson is the Canadian psychologist whose forthright views on women and why feminism is wrong have made him an alt-right YouTube breakout star. YouTube’s algorithm had connected him to Farage. I watch the speeches. They have titles like “Who the Hell [sic] You Think You Are? Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces.” And “Can’t Barrage the Farrage [sic].” They’ve been viewed millions upon millions of times. Richard Corbett, the leader of the Labour party in the European parliament, explains how it works. “Farage turns up once a month and often what he talks about has absolutely nothing to do with what’s being discussed. You think, what’s going on? And then you realise it’s got nothing to do with the parliament. It’s just for his social media output. Sometimes he doesn’t even hang around for the answers. Two minutes later, he’s back on the Eurostar and gone.” (Statistics for voting and attendances show Farage is ranked 738th out of 751 MEPs for productivity.) It’s these YouTube set-piece speeches, pumped via the site’s algorithm to the phones and laptops of an entirely new generation, that are Farage’s power base now. And, at the centre of this, is RT (formerly Russia Today), the Kremlin-controlled English-language broadcaster. RT made Farage a YouTube star. Much of this story, like Arron Banks’s relationship with the Russian ambassador, is hidden and covert. But there’s also much that is out in the open, like Farage’s support of pro-Russian parties in the European parliament, and his association with RT. Guillaume Chaslot, an ex-YouTuber who’s now an adviser for the Center for Humane Technology, explains RT’s all-conquering role in the YouTube ecosystem. “They’re the biggest information network on YouTube. They’ve 22 channels and they have an absolute masterful understanding of how the algorithm works. They make this incredibly effective clickbait content – disaster videos of the tsunami and so on, and they use it to suck in traffic. And when they have the eyeballs, they use their understanding of the algorithm to send people to political content that supports their foreign policy aims.” RT recognised Farage’s value way back in 2011. An ex-Ukip insider tells me how RT’s London correspondent “practically lived inside Ukip’s offices. They targeted Gerard Batten first [the current leader of Ukip] and then Farage. They loved it. RT would ask them on every week. They’d talk about anything.” Batten did not respond to the Observer’s questions about his relationship with RT. Farage is “phenomenally useful for the Russian government,” Ben Nimmo, a leading researcher into Russian online propaganda, tells me. “The thing about RT is that they are completely open about what it is. The editor-in-chief has described it as ‘information warfare’. She has said it’s as much a part of Russia’s arsenal as its ministry of defence.” All this is out in the open, but the Observer has been shown emails that reveal something new. The person who used to upload Farage’s videos to YouTube was an EU parliament staffer called Kevin Ellul Bonici. According to a Guardian report last year, sources inside the European parliament said Ellul Bonici – who did not respond to the allegations – was “a frequent visitor to the Russian embassy”, after which he would return with “a bootload of propaganda”, and was subject to an internal investigation. The new emails seen by the Observer show that Bonici was uploading content not just to the official Ukip channel but also uploading it “on a private channel” for “the many fringe websites”. There is no evidence that Farage knew about Ellul Bonici’s alleged relationship with the Russian embassy. When asked about all of the issues in this article, a spokesman for Farage said: “Mr Farage has no desire to speak to you under any circumstances.” The Observer could not reach Ellul Bonici for comment. The Observer has also learned new details about a meeting between Nigel Farage and Roger Stone. Stone is the extraordinary peroxide-blond 66-year-old dandy, a self-styled “dirty trickster” who’s played a key role in many political scandals since Watergate, and who is central to Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. On 8 August 2016, Stone told a small crowd that he’d been in touch with Assange. There would be a WikiLeaks “October surprise”, he suggested, about “the Clinton foundation”. In later comments he correctly forecast both the source of the leak and the timing of it. It is this claim to have knowledge of WikiLeaks’ material – before WikiLeaks released it – that is believed to have piqued Mueller’s intense interest. Mueller is looking at timings of all this. The timeline of who knew about WikiLeaks’ stash of emails from Democrat accounts, and when. Emails that we now know were hacked by the Russian government and that threw the presidential race into chaos just days before the US presidential election. Stone and his associates have been questioned by Mueller many times. Some of those associates of Stone are Farage’s associates too: InfoWars journalist Jerome Corsi, Steve Bannon and the controversial academic Ted Malloch, once tipped by Farage to be Trump’s ambassador to the EU. Stone makes his own appearance in the timeline. One of the film-makers behind the brilliant 2017 documentary Get Me Roger Stone, Daniel DiMauro, spoke to me about a meeting that he witnessed between Stone, Alex Jones and Farage during the Republican National Convention, 18-21 July 2016. “Stone had arranged to have dinner with Alex Jones and Nigel Farage,” he tells me. And they followed him with the camera crew. “But we got to the restaurant and Farage’s people were: ‘No, no, no! You can’t film. You can’t film.’ It was weird. Jones and Stone were totally open to it. But Farage was ‘No way’. He didn’t want any record of it. We didn’t know what to make of it. Another member of the crew told me: “It was the first time that Alex Jones, Roger Stone and Nigel Farage met face to face. We’d had a wire on Roger everywhere we went but when we turned up to meet Farage and his guy, he [Farage’s aide] was absolutely adamant. “What was so noticeable was how Alex Jones was so pumped up afterwards about the leaks that were coming. He was saying it openly on his show. And then days later, the DNC leaks dropped [on July 22] and blew apart the Democratic National Convention.” Less than two weeks later, on August 4, 2016, Roger Stone would also go on Alex Jones’s radio show and trail a new release. There would be “proof” of a scandal involving “Clinton Foundation”, a new “devastating” leak. “I think Julian Assange has that proof,” he said. In 2017, a spokesman for Farage told the American magazine Mother Jones: “Nigel met Roger Stone in a restaurant in Cleveland during the RNC purely by chance. They subsequently met each other in a hotel in Washington during Trump’s inauguration, again without planning and by chance.” If you had to pick another extraordinary story about Nigel Farage’s associates, George Cottrell would have to feature. Aged just 22, he was appointed Farage’s aide and Ukip’s chief fundraiser during the Brexit campaign. The two were at Chicago’s O’Hare airport on 22 July, 2016 – the day after the Republican convention in Cleveland at which Farage met Jones and Stone. Isabel Oakeshott, ghost writer to Arron Banks, was also at the airport. Banks’s memoir, the Bad Boys of Brexit, describes this scene: “As they were alighting from the domestic flight, five FBI officers cuffed him [Cottrell]. They swooped the minute he set foot on the gangway and if Wiggy [Andy Wigmore] hadn’t been standing right behind him, nobody would have known what had happened. All the other passengers were held back. It was swift and discreet, and he was hauled off without explanation.” Cottrell was subsequently charged with 21 offences, including money laundering, fraud, blackmail and extortion. He pleaded guilty to one of them and was released after eight months in jail. In an interview with the Telegraph, he explained how he’d learned about “the murky and complicated world of ‘shadow banking’” and had worked for “an offshore private bank” that was “under investigation by the US authorities as a foreign financial institution of primary money-laundering concern”. There is no suggestion in the charges that this was linked to Ukip. Cottrell did not respond to the Observer’s attempts to reach him. But the biggest questions are about why Farage’s team sent confidential legal documents about Cottrell’s arrest to the Russian embassy in London. In June, the Observer was shown confidential emails that revealed that Andy Wigmore emailed Cottrell’s legal documents including his federal indictment to his main contact at the embassy, the political secretary, Alexander Udod. (Udod was expelled from Britain in March this year after Sergei Skirpal’s poisoning.) According to Banks’s emails, on 17 August 2016, Banks and Wigmore were inside the Russian embassy, visiting the ambassador Alexander Yakovenko. This was also the day that Bannon took over as Trump’s campaign manager. On 25 August, Farage, Banks and Wigmore travelled to a Trump rally in Mississippi where Farage joined Trump on stage. The crowd roared. Here was “Mr Brexit,” said Trump. The election, he said, would be “Brexit plus, plus, plus.” The fourth time I call Nigel Farage’s LBC show is just a week ago. Late on Saturday night, the Observer published its latest revelations about Arron Banks and the Leave.EU campaign. An academic from Essex University, Emma Briant, had obtained emails from a Cambridge Analytica employee which revealed that Banks had sought Steve Bannon’s help in soliciting campaign donations from US funders. We have no idea if Banks went ahead and attempted to fundraise in the US. We know only that it would have been illegal for him if he had. Using foreign money in a British election campaign is against the law. But we do know the US “alt-right” played a role. On the day that Theresa May triggered article 50, 29 March 2017, a journalist from Breitbart, the rightwing news website cofounded by Steve Bannon, caught Farage with a pint of beer, outside a pub, beaming. He lifts his glass to the camera. “Well done, Bannon. Well done, Breitbart. You helped with this hugely.” In Britain, Farage is still the man with the pint. The Good Bloke. The kind of man you wouldn’t mind having a drink with. The plucky survivor of both testicular cancer and, on the day of the 2010 general election, a spectacular plane crash. And the press coverage of him – such as an interview with him in last week’s Sunday Times – still trades in Farage cliches. Partly because, as his former colleague Lance-Watkins tells me: “He is that man. He’s hail-fellow-well-met. He likes people and he has that natural bonhomie. He did so well on Question Time because it was a form that was perfectly made for him. But that’s just what’s going on, on the surface. It masks a profound insincerity.” Farage sits at the intersection of the key forces in a new world order. An order that the old formats can’t cope with. What we need to ask is whether a man closely allied to people like Bannon and supportive of Viktor Orbán should be allowed to amplify his propaganda unchallenged on our broadcast media. It’s the people who have studied the campaign most closely who are asking the most questions. Damian Collins, the Conservative MP leading parliament’s fake news and disinformation inquiry, has said that “the direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump” urgently need investigating. “We’ve got to recognise the bigger picture here,” he said recently. “This is being coordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we haven’t really seen before.” The committee has called repeatedly for a Mueller-style inquiry. The government continues to ignore it. ‘What’s your question for Nigel?” the LBC producer asks me when, last Sunday morning, I call in. This time I’m “Sarah from Weybridge”, a true-blue voter disgusted with Theresa May’s Brexit betrayal. “I’ll get you straight on,” says the producer. And he does. Actually, I tell Farage, it’s Carole Cadwalladr from the Observer. “Oh go away,” he says. “Honestly, you are a ranting lunatic.” It’s only later that I notice the date: 18 November. Exactly three years from when Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore launched Leave.EU’s campaign. The previous day in 2015 Banks had met the Russian ambassador and discussed gold deals. I’m not a ranting lunatic. I’m a journalist. Who’s been trying to ask questions for nearly two years. Nigel Farage declined to answer any questions put to him about subjects raised in this article. • This article was amended on 6 December 2018 to clarify a date and to remove an implication, mistakenly introduced during editing, that Arron Banks was present at the incident at O’Hare airport in Chicago. His ghostwriter was present."

          "bodyText": "I’m in a heavily air-conditioned studio in Surry Hills, somewhere above a line of wholesale fast fashion outlets, with some 16 other people who have decided to sacrifice their lunch break in pursuit of a greater goal. My goal right now: to pick up a 10kg medicine ball, jump forward with it as far as possible, then hurl the ball on to the concrete floor. My next goal: repeat this act. Do not pull a muscle. Do not pass out. The air conditioning is set at arctic because this is an F45 studio and, if it weren’t, we’d all be fainting. At least, that’s how it feels right now. When I walked in here I had more abstract objectives in mind – take stock of my fitness, scrutinise the trainers, try to figure out what kind of person attends an F45 class – but my scope has narrowed considerably in the 20 minutes or so since then. I’m a boxer and, by most measures, would be considered quite fit, yet I’m still sweating profusely, my quads are burning, and I’m just not sure I can throw this medicine ball again – let alone do the 90 seconds’ worth of box jumps that await me a few stations to my left. F45 is the kind of workout that makes you work. There are all kinds of ways one might choose to worship at the temple of fitness. F45 isn’t the most well-known of these or even the latest, but it’s exploding in popularity. The Australian-born brand – the F stands for “functional” and the 45 for the duration of the workout in minutes – founded in Sydney in 2011 by the equities trader-cum-entrepreneur Rob Deutsch, has since spread to 37 countries, boasting more than 1,320 franchises, with gyms in Sweden, Estonia and Wales. Deutsch claims F45 has trained more than 1 million people worldwide, and that the brand is worth, in total, some US$300m. So, what’s the appeal? My friend Gillian Bent is the first person to admit to me that she is a convert. She tells me that despite a visceral dislike for group workouts – “I don’t like being sweaty and gross in front of lots of people” – she found herself addicted after she went along to a free trial with a workmate. “I like that there’s a variety of cardio and weights, and that you can show up and do the class and leave,” she says. “There’s no faffing around trying to set up equipment, deciding what you want to do. It’s all worked out for you.” Bent struggled to find the motivation or creativity to make regular independent gym sessions much fun. To get some momentum, she forked out about $50 a session for a personal trainer, who would push her hard, but it wasn’t a realistic long-term option given her budget. As long as she was attending at least twice a week on average, F45 was a more economical choice. Plus, she says, the small group environment, being at turns supportive and competitive, is motivating. She estimates she has been going to classes between two and six times a week since April. “I would still go to a personal trainer if I liked one enough,” she says. “But I definitely exercise more than I was before.” Fitness trends have a tendency to burst into the cultural consciousness with firework intensity (remember when you discovered nearly everyone in your workplace was doing pilates?) before fading away just as rapidly (Tae Bo, anyone?). Falling somewhere between a health endeavour and a fashion accessory, they have that perplexing tendency to be both aspirational and exclusionary, suggesting that fitness is something that’s only attainable for those with the disposable income to pay for the latest, hippest studio membership, or to purchase special equipment. The longevity of these trends varies, but one of the simplest explanations for F45’s success thus far is savvy economics: an accessible (though not insignificant) price point for its target market: health-conscious professional women aged 25 to 40, who probably like a wine on the weekend – a profile my friend fits to a T, and if I’m honest, so do I. The obvious point of comparison to F45, both in structure, faddishness, and the slightly terrifying level of evangelism of its devotees, is CrossFit. Its classes are circuits-based, around a series of often explosive exercises – think box jumps, burpees, hammer swings, clean and jerk weightlifting – in high-intensity intervals. Again these are based on what the fitness industry calls “functional training” – that is, workouts based around movements of the body that support day-to-day activity. For the average punter, the difference between a “functional” and a “non-functional” workout amounts to less time in front of the mirror doing biceps curls, and more time spent on whole-body activities, such as running, jumping and lifting. “Functional training” is a loaded term in some circles, though, as it has its origins in sports physiotherapy and rehabilitation. It has made its way into the mainstream, in the way of “organic” foods and “natural” cosmetics, via appropriation by marketers and entrepreneurs who have a product to sell. The rise in the “functional training” trend loosely parallels a decline in the old-school culture of bodybuilding and physique development – which focused on working muscle groups in isolation, accompanied by supplement-heavy nutrition plans – and the corresponding rise of the wellness industry. At the same time, there has been a subtle but significant shift in the way we talk about exercise. As overt body-shaming rhetoric has become volatile territory for advertisers, slogans have taken on a vaguely empowering tone. Where once we wanted to be skinny, now we want to be strong. Nobody crash diets anymore, they “cleanse” and “alkalise”. We don’t want to get swole, we want to “sculpt” and “tone”. The objective is still to be fit, but the obvious question – fit for what, exactly? – is rarely asked. The bald truth is that the products for sale these days differ little from their predecessors. “Transformation” diets, for example, invariably cut food consumption to about 1,200 to 1,400 calories a day for women and 1,700 to 1,900 for men – at, if not below, the average person’s basal metabolic rate (that is, the amount of energy a resting body requires simply to continue basic functions like, you know, breathing and staying warm). At the same time, hawkers of such products expound the importance of “fuelling” your body with “real” food – a sentiment that is literally an order at F45, which has its own 10 commandments plastered to the wall of every gym. These don’t exactly help the gym avoid its cultish appearance, especially given that the eighth commandment is: “Thou shalt ‘high five’ after the workout.” I do a double take when I turn up for my first class and see the commandments on the wall. Then the instructor asks if she can take my photo. “What? Why?!” I splutter. “It helps us learn everyone’s names,” she says. True or not, she certainly remembers my name when she comes over to high five me when I’m collapsed on the floor at the end of the session, trying to catch my breath. “I hated the high fives at first,” says my friend when we talk about it later. “I thought it was the daggiest, most awkward, culty thing – now I freaking love it. I’m like, ‘Yeah, I freaking smashed it. Come on!’” F45’s workouts are themed around the movement patterns for specific sports, with names like Brooklyn (boxing), Quarterback (grid-iron), and Pipeline (surfing). Schedules vary, with the exception of Saturday mornings, when every gym runs a workout called Hollywood, during which a DJ is employed to come and spin tunes live in the studio. It’s the most consistently popular workout. “The energy in the room for those sessions is absolutely through the roof,” says F45’s director of fitness, Chris Barnes. He runs the Surry Hills gym I attend during my trial week. Most of the workouts are designed by Barnes and others; some are created by algorithm. In the handful of classes I attend, I realise that the “smashed it” feeling is kind of inevitable when you spend the better part of an hour hurtling full pelt through a complicated workout backed by heavy, driving bass. Speed is the order of the day: instructions are barked at participants in record time, and there’s no careful attention to form. New participants are encouraged to take it easy and ask for help, but it’s hard not to feel as though you need to keep up with the cracking pace set by the music, the timers, and the hyperactive little avatars on the TV screens dotted around the room to remind you what to do at each station. Isn’t that a recipe for disaster? Barnes believes that the instructions given are adequate, and that workouts are “scalable” depending on your capacity and fitness level. Deutsch, meanwhile, won’t give exact data on F45’s injury rates, but he says the company took lessons from its competitors, particularly CrossFit, when designing the program. “We don’t do any powerlifting, we don’t have any heavy weights in the studio,” he says. “We don’t do a lot of the exercises that we’ve seen CrossFitters break down on.” He argues that F45 has actually helped people recover from injury but accepts that there’s always going to be a level of risk. “The reality is when you’re burning something between 600 and 900 calories in 45 minutes, the potential to get injured versus walking on a treadmill is far greater. But the potential to actually get meaningful results is also far greater,.” While I am deeply sceptical about Deutsch’s estimated calorie burn – even taking into account variations of age, gender and fitness level, 900 calories in 45 minutes is exceptionally high – meaningful results in this context nevertheless mean weight loss. F45’s Challenges are all structured around this principle. An optional program runs for eight weeks, four times a year, for a fee, complete with meal plans prescribing – you guessed it – about 1,300 calories a day for women and 1,900 for men. Critically, though, the challenge is competitive: prizes varying from memberships to holidays are on offer for those who produce the most effective “transformation” over the eight-week period, compared with their fellow studio members and others worldwide. Despite the challenges and their inherent competitiveness being a key driver of membership, Barnes and Deutsch are keen to stress the sense of community in their studios. As if in demonstration of this, they both, separately, at the end of our interviews, invite me to work out with them when they’re next in town. I decline – while the few lunchtime classes I took were certainly intense, it’s not my preferred form of self-punishment. Still, I do consider going back every now and then – there are worse things one could do in a lunch break."

          "bodyText": "There is a scene in Moneyball, the story of how the Oakland A’s defied a tiny budget to come close to reaching the 2002 World Series, that neatly encapsulates the friction between gnarly, gum-chewing scouts and the newer wave of analysts who seek truths in spreadsheets. “You don’t put a team together with a computer,” the A’s scouting director, Grady Fuson, scoffs at the general manager, Billy Beane, who has begun deep-mining data to find undervalued – and thus cheap – players. “Baseball isn’t just numbers. It isn’t science … there are intangibles that only baseball people understand.” Beane’s terse response? “Adapt or die.” Times have changed – a bit – since Michael Lewis wrote Moneyball but many in sport still prefer to trust their gut over any algorithm. Which is why a tweet last week from Thomas Bjørn, Europe’s 2018 Ryder Cup captain, was so unusual. After linking to a piece titled “How analytics helped reclaim the Ryder Cup”, written by Blake Wooster of the golf consultancy 15th Club, an enthusiastic Bjørn wrote “Stick to the plan!!! These guys played a vital role. Thanks for your hard work.” Bjørn, it turned out, had embraced data and analytics as “a useful addition to his toolbox” shortly after being named captain in December 2016, when he asked 15th Club whether he should pick two, three or four wildcards. The answer? Four. Because the data showed wildcards tend to perform better than those who qualify in the last couple of automatic spots. And so began a relationship that culminated in Europe’s thumping 17½ – 10½ victory over USA in September. Analytics also helped Bjørn answer tricky questions such as how important is experience versus form in the Ryder Cup, and which factors help determine success in foursomes and fourballs. They also reassured him that picking Sergio García as a wildcard made sense because the Spaniard’s underlying performance was better than his bare results implied. 15th Club’s influence continued in Versailles, with analysts suggesting the ideal fourballs and foursomes pairings for every player based on the format, their strengths, and the course layout – which included the strong recommendation Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood should play together. Crucially they also had enough of Bjørn’s ear to reassure him and his vice-captains to “stick to the plan”’ on the first morning when Europe were about to go 3-1 down and were considering last-minute changes to the afternoon foursomes. As Wooster relates: “This was a critical moment, and one where all those months spent establishing relationships and trust came to the fore. We knew the foursomes was a very different format and our statistical simulations gave us a high level of confidence the afternoon would be ours.” Bjørn listened and stuck to the plan. Europe won the session 4-0 and never looked back. Such insight and influence is rare. Analytics in sport is increasingly mainstream – even Match of the Day shows expected goals – yet organisations guard even minor insights like diamonds. True, back in the day Sam Allardyce hailed his “fantastic four” metrics at Bolton, including the realisation that inswinging corners were much more successful than outswingers. Most teams, however, prefer to stay schtum. Anyone who has read another Lewis book, The Undoing Project, will understand how hard it can be for outsiders to convince old pros to embrace new ideas. The first chapter outlines howthe Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, a man smart enough to build statistical models to predict performances of pro basketball players, led the Rockets to the third-best record of the 30 NBA teams in his decade in charge. Yet as Morey admitted to Lewis, “there’s an intense feeling among basketball people that I don’t belong – they remain silent during periods of success and pop up when they sense weakness”. As Lewis relates, when the Rockets headed into the 2015 Western Conference finals, the former Olympic dream team player Charles Barkley dismissed Morey and analytics as “crap”, telling viewers: “All these guys who run these organisations who talk about analytics have one thing in common. They’re a bunch of guys who ain’t never played the game and they never got the girls in high school.” There are plenty of Barkleys out there. So how were 15th Club able to make such a difference? Much of it was down to Bjørn, who encouraged rigorous and open discussion and, despite being a golf professional for 25 years, was intrigued by fresh ideas. But Wooster’s team also understood that, having failed to make an impact when part of Team Europe at Hazeltine in 2016, they had to forge deeper friendships and better understand when to intervene. As he came to realise: “The strength of your models is really just one part of the jigsaw – it is as much about emotional intelligence as analytical expertise.” This speaks to a wider point. The best teams know the choice between art and science is a false one. It is a combination of the two that works best, along with the mindset to be open to new ideas, whether they come from someone with 30 years in the trenches or a PhD in advanced algebra. Incidentally this is something Beane has long recognised. Despite his differences with Fuson over analytics, he recognised the scout’s unique talents when he brought him back to Oakland to be his special assistant in 2010."

          "bodyText": "Alan Turing’s famous test of whether machines could fool us into believing they were human – “the imitation game” – has become a mundane, daily question for all of us. We are surrounded by machine voices, and think nothing of conversing with them – though each time I hear my car tell me where to turn left I am reminded of my grandmother, who having installed a telephone late in life used to routinely say goodnight to the speaking clock. We find ourselves locked into interminable text chats with breezy automated bank tellers and offer our mother’s maiden name to a variety of robotic speakers that sound plausibly alive. I’ve resisted the domestic spies of Apple and Amazon, but one or two friends jokingly describe the rapport they and their kids have built up with Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Home Hub – and they are right about that: the more you tell your virtual valet, the more you disclose of wants and desires, the more speedily it can learn and commit to memory those last few fragments of your inner life you had kept to yourself. As the line between human and digital voices blurs, our suspicions are raised: who exactly are we talking to? No online conversation or message-board spat is complete without its doubters: “Are you a bot?” Or, the contemporary door-slam: “Bot: blocked!” Those doubts will only increase. The ability of bots – a term which can describe any automated process present in a computer network – to mimic human online behaviour and language has developed sharply in the past three years. For the moment, most of us remain serenely confident that we can tell the difference between a human presence and the voices of the encoded “foot soldiers” of the internet that perform more than 50% of its tasks and contribute about 20% of all social media “conversation”. That confidence does not extend, however, to those who have devoted the last decade or so to trying to detect, and defend against, that bot invasion. Naturally, because of the scale of the task, they must enlist bots to help them find bots. The most accessible automated Turing test is the creation of Professor Emilio Ferrara, principal investigator in machine intelligence and data science at the University of Southern California. In its infancy the bot-detector “BotOrNot?” allowed you to use many of the conventional indicators of automation – abnormal account activity, repetition, generic profiles – to determine the origin of a Twitter feed. Now called the Botometer (after the original was targeted by copycat hacks), it boasts a sophisticated algorithm based on all it has learned. It’s a neat trick. You can feed it your own – or anyone else’s – Twitter name and quickly establish how bot-like your bon mots are. On a scale where zero is human and five is machine, mine scored 0.2, putting @TimAdamsWrites on a sentient level with @JeremyCorbyn, but – disturbingly – slightly more robotic than @theresa_may. Speaking to me on the phone last week, Ferrara explained how in the five years since BotOrNot has been up and running, detection has become vastly more complex. “The advance in artificial intelligence and natural language processing makes the bots better each day,” he says. The incalculable data sets that Google and others have harvested from our incessant online chatter are helping to make bots sound much more like us. The Botometer is powered by two systems. One is a “white box” that has been trained over the years to examine statistical patterns in the language, Ferrara says, “as well as the sentiment, the opinion,” of tweets. In all there are more than 1,200 weighted features that a Twitter feed is measured against to determine if it has a pulse. Alongside that, the Botometer has a “black-box model” fed with a mass of data from bots and humans, which has developed its own sets of criteria to separate man from machine. Ferrara and his team are not exactly sure what this system relies on for its judgments, but they are impressed by its accuracy. When Ferrara started on this work, he felt he had developed his own sixth sense for sniffing out artificial intelligence on Twitter. Now he is no longer so confident. “Today it is not clear to me that I interact with as many humans as I thought I did,” he says. “We look hard at some accounts, we run them through the algorithm and it is undecided. Quite often now it is a coin toss. The language seems too good to be true.” Not all bots aim to deceive; many perform routine operations. Bots were originally created to help automate repetitive tasks, saving companies money and time. Some bots help to refresh your Facebook feed, or keep you up to date with the weather. On social media, bots were originally coded to search for hashtags and keywords and retweet or amplify messages: “OMG have you seen this?!” They acted as cheerleaders for Justin Bieber or Star Wars or Taylor Swift. There were “vanity bots” which added numbers and fake “likes” to profiles to artificially enhance their status, and “traffic bots” designed to drive customers to a particular shopping site. There were also bots that acted as grammarians, making pedantic corrections to tweets, or simple gags like Robot J McCarthy, which sought out conversations using the word “communist” and replied with a nonsensical slogan. At some point political bots entered the fray, mostly on Twitter, with the intent of spreading propaganda and misinformation. Originally these seem to have been the work of individual hackers, before the techniques were adopted by organised and lavishly funded groups. These bots, Ferrara suggests, proved to be a highly efffective way to broadcast extremist viewpoints and spread conspiracy theories, but also were programmed to search out such views from other, genuine accounts by liking, sharing, retweeting and following, in order to give them disproportionate prominence. It is these bots that the social media platforms have been trying to cull in the wake of investigations into the 2016 American election by Robert Mueller and others. Twitter has taken down a reported 6m bot accounts this year. When I spoke to Ferrara he was looking at the data from the American midterm elections, examining the viral spread of fake news and the ways in which it was still being “weaponised” by battalions of automated users. “If you were an optimist you would think that the numbers look OK,” he says. “Between 10 and 11% of the users involved in conversations around the election are flagged as bots – and that is significantly less than in 2016 when it was something like 20%. The pessimistic interpretation is that our bot-detection systems are not picking up the more sophisticated bots, which look just like humans even to the eyes of the algorithms.” The unseen global army of “bot herders”, those shadowy individuals and corporations and rogue government agencies that send their bots out into the virtual world, have a couple of advantages in this latter respect. One is that they are now able to find enormous amounts of natural-language data to develop the next generation of talkative bots. The other is that these creations can exploit our tendency to ascribe trusted human characteristics to voices even if, on a rational level, we suspect that they are artificial. That psychology is as old as electronic communication itself. All modern chatbots trace their family tree back to the experiments by Joseph Weizenbaum with Eliza, named after Ms Dolittle in Pygmalion for “her” ability to master received pronunciation. In 1966, Weizenbaum, a German-American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created a prototype chatbot that searched for keywords in conversations conducted with humans typing at keyboards. The rudimentary program would pick up these words and use them in its reply. If it did not locate a useful word, it would offer a neutral response. Weizenbaum set up Eliza to mimic the tone and manner of an east coast psychotherapist, a dynamic that allowed its voice to “adopt the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world”. The professor had assumed that his bit of trickery would be a useful way of teaching his students about the structures of language and dialogue. What he discovered however, was that several of them became hooked on conversing with Eliza and telling her their troubles, opening up to the program as if it were a therapist. When Weizenbaum’s secretary asked him to leave the room one morning because she was in the middle of a session with Eliza, he became alarmed by the general willingness to be so seduced by a machine voice. He published an academic paper which included the first notable conversation between woman and machine. It went like this. Woman: Men are all alike. Eliza: In what way? W: They’re always bugging us about something or other. E: Can you think of a specific example? W: Well, my boyfriend made me come here. E: Your boyfriend made you come here? W: He says I’m depressed much of the time. E: I am sorry to hear that you are depressed. W: It’s true. I am unhappy. E: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy? W: I need some help, that much seems certain. E: What would it mean to you if you got some help? W: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother. E: Tell me more about your family. W: My mother takes care of me. E: Who else in your family takes care of you? W: My father. E: Your father? W: You are like my father in some ways. E: What resemblance do you see? W: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don’t want me to notice that. E: What makes you think I am not very aggressive? W: You don’t argue with me… Weizenbaum later became a fierce critic of the ways that human intelligence was becoming in thrall to artificial intelligence, which he viewed as a corporatised, reactionary force. He was stunned by how quickly the users of Eliza gave human agency to what was a relatively simple piece of code. It indicated to him that the brain had evolved to view all speech as meaningful, even if it came from a patently fake source. He worried, extremely presciently, about the implications of this: “The whole issue of the credibility [to humans] of machine output demands investigation,” he concluded in his paper. “Important decisions increasingly tend to be made in response to computer output. Eliza shows, if nothing else, how easy it is to create and maintain the illusion of understanding.” The many progeny of Eliza have evolved into chatbots – bits of software designed to mimic human conversation. They include recent entries into the annual Loebner prize, which offers chatbot contestants the chance to fool a panel of human judges with their intelligence. The comforting principle of telling our deepest fears to a machine is also exploited in various “therapy” platforms, marketed as a genuine alternative to conventional talking cures. Each of them trades on the idea of our fundamental desire to be listened to, the impulse which shapes social media. Lisa-Maria-Neudert is part of the computational propaganda project at Oxford University, which studies the ways in which political bots have been used to spread disinformation and distort online discourse. She argues that the seductive intimacy of chatbots will prove to be the next battleground in this ongoing war. The Oxford research team began examining the huge growth of bot activity on social media after the shooting down of the MH17 passenger plane with a Russian missile in 2014. A dizzying number of competing conspiracy theories were “seeded” and encouraged to spread by a red army of automated agents, muddying the facts of the atrocity. The more Oxford researchers looked, the more they saw how similar patterns of online activity were amplifying specific hashtags or distorting news. In the beginning, Neudert suggests, the bots would rely on volume. “For example,” she says, “in the Arab spring bots were flooding hashtags that activists were using underground in order to make the conversation useless.” Or, like Eliza, bots would respond to a keyword to get a marginal topic trending, and, often, into the news. This was an effective but blunt instrument. “If I tweet something saying ‘I hate Trump’,” Neudert explains, an old-style bot “would send me a message about Trump because it is responding to that keyword. But if I say ‘I love Trump’, it would send me the same message.” These bots were not smart enough to recognise intent, but that is changing. “The commercial companies that are using artificial intelligence and natural language processing right now are already building such technologies. What we are doing as a project is to try to find out if the political actors are already using them also.” Neudert is particularly interested in the new generation of branded chatbots that push content and initiate conversations on messaging platforms. Such chatbots – which openly declare themselves to be automated – represent a new way for businesses and news services to attract your attention, giving the impression of speaking just to you. She imagines the propaganda bots will use the same technology, but without declaring themselves. “They’ll present themselves as human users participating in online conversation in comment sections, group chats, and message boards.” At present the feasibility of a truly conversational chatbot, one that can understand the context of any conversational gambit, pick up tonal ambiguities and retain a sense of how the discussion is evolving, is still a long way off. The new generation of chatbots might be good at answering direct questions or interrupting debates, but they are ill-equipped to sustain coherence over a range of subjects. What they may soon be capable of is maintaining short bursts of plausible dialogue with a predetermined narrative. In a recent paper in the MIT Review, Neudert suggests that in the near future such “conversational bots might seek out susceptible users and approach them over private chat channels. They’ll eloquently navigate conversations and analyse a user’s data to deliver customised propaganda.” In this scenario, and judging by what is already happening, the bots will have the capacity to “point people towards extremist viewpoints, counter arguments in a conversational manner [and] attack individuals with scripted hate speech, overwhelm them with spam, or get their accounts shut down by reporting their content as abusive.” And of course all of this will be done by a voice that engages one on one, that talks just to us. There are a number of fast-growing companies that are beginning offer the kind of technology that Neudert describes, as a legitimate marketing tool. Several are official partners of Facebook in order to use its Messenger service. They include the market-leading Russian-based company Chatfuel, which has enabled thousands of organisations to build Messenger chatbots, including headline acts such as the NFL and the Labour party, and a number of smaller operations such as Berlin-based Spectrm, which has created Messenger chatbots for the likes of CNN and Red Bull. I spoke to Max Koziolek, one of the founders of Spectrm, who is (predictably) evangelical about this new way of businesses speaking “like a friend” to their users and customers. Using a combination of natural language data and human input, Spectrm has created bots that can already converse on a narrow range of subject matter. “On a specialist subject you can now get to 85% of queries pretty fast,” Koziolek says, “and then you will have the long tail, all those surprise questions which take ages to get right. But if you are making something to answer queries about Red Bull, for example, does it really need to know who is the chancellor of Germany?” One of the most successful chatbots Spectrm has created was a public health initiative to advise on the morning-after contraceptive pill. “It is one of those times when someone might prefer to speak to a bot than a human because they are a bit embarrassed,” Koziolek says. “They talk to the bot about what they should do about having had unprotected sex and it understands naturally 75% of queries, even if they are writing in a language which is not very clear.” Within a year of listening and learning, he is confident that capacity will have increased to nearly 100%. Increasingly we will become used to almost every entity in our lives “talking to us as if it is a friend”, he suggests, a relationship that will require certain rules of engagement. “If you send messages after 11pm that’s bad. And also if you send too many. I wouldn’t send more than two messages a day as a publisher, for example. It’s a very intimate space. A friend is sending me relevant information and at the right time.” Far from being a new frontier in the propaganda wars, Koziolek believes – hugely optimistically – that such direct conversation could help to clear the internet of hate speech, giving users more control over who they hear from. Does it matter whether they know that the chat is from a machine? “We don’t see big differences,” he says. “Sometimes our bots have a clear personality and sometimes they don’t. Bots which have a personality will always say goodnight, for example. Or ‘How are you?’” Do those types of bots produce longer conversations? “Different kinds of conversations. Even though you know this thing is a robot, you behave differently toward it. I would say you cannot avoid that. Even though you know it is a machine, you immediately talk to it just like it is a human.” This blurring of those lines is less welcome to observers like Ferrara, who has had a front-row seat in the changing dialogues between human and machine. I wonder, in observing at close quarters for so long if he has, anecdotally, felt the mood of conversations changing, if interactions have become angrier? He says he has. “The thing was, I was becoming increasingly concerned about all sorts of phenomena,” he says. “I worked on a variety of problems, bots was one. I also looked at radicalisation, at how Twitter was being used to recruit Isis and at how conspiracies affected people’s decision-making when it comes to public health, when it comes to vaccines and smoking. I looked at how bots and other campaigns [that] had been used to try to manipulate the stock market. There are all sorts of things that have nefarious consequences.” What aspect of this behaviour alarmed him the most? “The most striking thing to me to this day is that people are really, really bad at assessing the source of information,” he says. One thing his team have shown is that the rate at which people retweet information from bots is identical to that from humans. “That is concerning for all sorts of reasons.” Despite the revelation of such findings, he gets frustrated that people, for political purposes, still seek to dismiss the ways in which these phenomena have changed the nature of online discourse. As if the most targeted propaganda, employed on the most unregulated of mass media, had no effect on opinion or behaviour. One of his later projects has been to try to show how quickly messages can spread from, and be adopted by, targeted user groups. Last year, Ferrara’s team received permission to introduce a series of “good” health messages to Twitter via bots posing as humans. They quickly built up thousands of followers, revealing the ways in which a flood of messages, from apparently like-minded agents, can very quickly and effectively change the tone and attitude of online conversation. Unfortunately, such “good” bots are vastly outnumbered by those seeking to spread discord and disinformation. Where does he place his faith in a solution? “This is not a problem you can solve with technology alone,” he says. “You need tech, you need some system of regulation that incentivises companies to do that. It requires a lot of money. And then you need public opinion to care enough to want to do something about it.” I suggest to him that there seems to be a grain of hope in the fact that people are reaching out in greater numbers toward trusted, fact-checked news sources: subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post are up (and the Guardian and Observer just notched up a million online supporters). “It’s true,” he says. “But then I have a chart on my screen which I am looking at as I talk to you. It gives live information on the sources of things being retweeted by different groups. Way at the top is Breitbart: 31%. Second: Fox News. Then the Gateway Pundit [a far-right news site]. Looking at this,” he says, “it is like we haven’t yet learned anything from 2016.”"

          "bodyText": "For 24 hours on 15 October, 12 adults, 11 children and a baby transformed a cavernous, sunken gallery at Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art into a post-apocalyptic communist utopia, set on a Dyson sphere in the year 7231. The museum was shut to the public that day, meaning the only witnesses were eight cameras and two French artists, Fabien Giraud and Raphael Siboni, who watched as their subjects battled with the encroaching forces of time, mortality and capitalism. Dressed in ye olde costumes, the characters were directed by a computer algorithm, which determined, among other things, which of them would die each hour. Like New Australia before it, this utopia was doomed from the start. Titled 7231, the resulting film is about 16 hours long, set to hypnotic strings with eerie prose narration and projected on loop. This is part two of Giraud and Siboni’s The Unmanned: an epic, ongoing art program that continues this year at Mona. In the first season, exhibited in February, the artists grappled with a history of computation in reverse through eight films you can still watch snippets of online. With the second season, the Everted Capital – a series of films and sculptures that opened this month – they’re speculating on a history of capitalism in reverse. The sculptures are finely crafted, and the film hypnotic – but it’s a conceptually difficult show, made no more accessible by the exhibition description, which describes it using words like “peculiar”, “gruelling” and “more poetry than prose”. The artists prefer it that way. “We seem to always ask ‘why?’, and ‘what is the reasons for things?’,” Giraud says, when pressed. “More than ‘why?’, I’m interested in getting people to reflect on ‘why we ask why?’.” “Our main concern is how we can change the way we think of the future, in order to change ourselves in the present,” Giraud explains, when pressed again. “Late-stage capitalism is just working on its own eschatology. It hyperventilates on its own power to destroy.” Rather than trying to save the planet by abandoning capitalism and going backwards, the artists ask what would happen if we pushed everything further, and reclaimed the future instead. “Currency entirely changed our value system and our space. So what are we going to do to currency that will change it again?” Giraud asks. “Can we just mourn the earth, and then step forward into something else?” Each season of the Unmanned has a prologue or “axiom”, and for The Everted Capital it’s another film. For this one, the artists gathered a menagerie of non-human animals that had all, at one point, been traded (including a beetle, a snake, an ostrich, an eagle), placed them in a six-metre sphere-shaped enclosure (overseen by animal handlers, I’m assured), and filmed them with a military grade thermal imaging camera. Giraud refers to it as an “ecosystem of currency”; like the rest of the exhibition, it’s hypnotic, unsettling, and difficult to immediately wrap your head around. To get from the axiom to the main room, the visitor walks through a hole in the wall that looks like it’s been punched in by a giant. The 16-hour film is projected on the back wall, in front of which lies an enormous white plinth that holds two separate collections of sculptures; adding further complication, these sculptures comprise the “axiom” and first episode of the program’s third season, titled The Form of Not. The axiom is a set of “blades”, conceived of by artificial intelligence. The artists inputted thousands of images of man-made blades into a computer program, which used that information to design millions of its own – 24 of which were exquisitely crafted by a studio in Switzerland, who constructed the 3D versions from materials such as glass, obsidian, forged iron and prehistoric bone. The second group of sculptures, Face Value, seem to hang from a complex network of rope, and burst into (and in some cases, below) the plinth; some are props from the 16-hour film, and others have been moulded from 3D prints of ancient masks – the faces represent coinage – and cuneiforms from Mona’s own collection. The artists have incorporated wax, resin, salt and mildew into each: materials that are mined and traded in the film, as the society reverts to capitalism; and which, in real life, represent both preservation and decay. The effect is a cold one in the eerie, cavernous space, even though the sculptures are in some ways alive: some drip, others crystallise, and a few are growing over with mould. (Museums being sterile environments, the artists were only allowed to bring in spores if they sealed them with plastic. “In the end, [the gallery] won,” Giraud shrugs.) Curator Nicole During has been working with the artists on the project for “a long time”, but admits she only recently began to understand “parts of it”. “I’ll never truly understand it. That’s the thrilling thing … They’re not making work like [other artists]. They’re making their own kind of world.” (The next episode of The Everted Capital will be set in 1971, and will unfold in Japan next year.) The Unmanned launched on the same day as another Mona commission, Your Shadow Rising, from British painter and sculptor Toby Ziegler. It marks the first time six exhibitions have been held over one summer at the gallery, which is still basking in the literal glow of new wing, Pharos, and its series of astounding and immersive James Turrell installations. This flurry of activity, compounded by the major show Zero, is well-timed: a public showcase of the gallery’s tourism potential, as it attempts to win DA approval for a new on-site hotel. It’s easy to find common threads between The Unmanned and Your Shadow Rising. Ziegler’s work deals in themes of fire, trauma, time and transformation, and two of his major sculptures relied, like the sculptures in the Unmanned, on 3D modelling and printing for their creation; similarly, for his exquisite corpse video series It Will Soon Be Over, Ziegler input images into an AI – in this case, reverse image search engines – and left the technology to create its own art. He refers to his work as “a negotiation between figuration and abstraction … but ultimately you want people to have to negotiate it for themselves, as well.” Challenging the visitor, or leaving them with more questions than answers, seems to fit the ethos of Mona, which is known for its unconventional – or intentionally provocative – curation. But the idea that Mona sets out to poke the art world grates on curator Durling. “We’re not trying to do things ‘outside of the box’. … I can’t make shows any other way, we can’t work with artists any other way,” she says. And don’t get her started on the museum’s “terrible” unofficial slogan, the museum of sex and death. “It took us years to live that down,” she says, with a grimace. “I don’t know who said [it first]. We use shorthand a lot, internally … and somebody said it to somebody in the media once, and off it went.” (The slogan is not entirely un-earned: when I revisit the general collection later that day I discover two seperate pieces that depict skeletons copulating.) “[Walsh] is great at summarising, condensing, distilling [ideas] into these great grabs,” she says. “Is [Mona] a reaction to other museums that he’s seen? Possibly, yeah. But also, this is authentically him.” • Fabien Giraud and Raphaël Siboni’s The Unmanned, and Your Shadow Rising by Toby Ziegler, are open now at Mona in Hobart"

          "bodyText": "The UK government is in a state of denial about the impact of austerity policies on the poor, UN rapporteur Philip Alston’s hard-hitting report on poverty, concluded. Here are some of the main points. Austerity Alston was critical of the “mentality” behind cuts and reforms introduced in the past few years that have brought misery and torn at the social fabric. “British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited and callous approach …” Universal credit The government’s ambitious programme to simplify the benefits system was a good idea in principle but was “fast falling into universal discredit” and should be overhauled. It was gratuitously punitive in its effects. Draconian sanctions and long payment delays drove claimants into hardship, depression and despair. Brexit The most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society will take the biggest hit from Brexit, Alston said. People felt their homes, jobs and communities were at risk. “Ironically it was these very fears and insecurity that contributed significantly to the Brexit vote.” Who suffers? “Changes to taxes and benefits have taken the highest toll on those least able to bear it,” said Alston, with the costs of austerity falling disproportionately on the poor, women, ethnic minorities, children, single parents, asylum seekers and people with disabilities. Holes in the social safety net Massive cuts to council funding, alongside big rises in demand for social care, had reduced many local authorities to providing basic services only, and had heralded the closure of libraries, parks and youth clubs. This was “damaging the fabric” of British society and eroding its sense of community. Poverty Alston said the UK government had told him the social support system was working and there was no extreme poverty in the UK. But the individual testimonies he received during his visit told a different story. “There is a striking and almost complete disconnect between what I heard from the government and what I consistently heard from many people directly, across the country.” A digital welfare state The government’s embrace of digital technology and automation was especially visible in universal credit, where the digital-by-default approach excluded people with no internet access or skills. “We are witnessing the gradual disappearance of the postwar British welfare state behind a webpage and an algorithm,” Alston said."

          "bodyText": "Monday One of the more depressing signs of ageing is the frequency with which unsolicited mail offering me a first viewing of an exclusive new retirement village drops through the letterbox. Today I got one for a development in Clapham where I could “experience an independent lifestyle in a secure environment”. Needless to say, the brochure went straight in the bin but I am now starting to worry that the advertisers know something about me that I don’t, and that sooner or later a brochure will arrive and I will think, “You know what? That’s just what I’ve always wanted.” The kiss of death. Another sign of getting on a bit is that Prince Charles at 70 no longer feels so much older than me. In my 20s, Charles felt as if he was from a different species, let alone generation. Now, at just eight years older than me, he feels almost a kindred spirit; in ageing body parts, if nothing else. It must be weird reaching an age at which most people have retired and knowing that you have yet to really start your main job. The Queen’s refusal to abdicate is becoming increasingly baffling. Most people in their 90s would both fancy easing up a bit and also want their child to be fulfilled. But the Queen just plods on. There must be more to it than duty. Either she must truly believe Charles would make a hopeless king or part of her believes that without being queen she has no sense of purpose. It’s a question no royal biographer has ever satisfactorily answered. Tuesday Every cloud has a silver lining. The afternoon was shaping up to be a humiliation for the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, who had drawn the short straw of trying to argue the government’s case for why it didn’t need to provide MPs with the legal analysis of its Brexit negotiations in a binding debate brought by the Labour party. Lidington is one of the more gracious and reasonable members of Theresa May’s cabinet and it rapidly became evident that he didn’t believe a word of the case he was being asked to argue. He ended with a plaintive plea that if the opposition were just to forget the whole thing, he was sure he could find a way to let MPs see some of the legal advice at some point or other. This call was not heeded however, and with the Eurosceptic Conservatives of the European Research Group and the DUP voting with the opposition, the government and Lidington were left in a state of severe embarrassment. Then salvation. News broke that the UK and the EU had agreed a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement and Lidington’s defeat in the Commons barely got a mention. In fact things got so frenetic that Reuters accidentally reported that two government ministers had resigned and the pound promptly fell. Mind you, if it had been Chris Grayling’s resignation that had been misreported the pound would have soared. Wednesday In a counter-intuitive report, the investment firm Brewin Dolphin reports that, far from children being helped out by the Bank of Mum and Dad, more than a third of those in their 20s and 30s are offering financial support to their parents. To which I can only say, bring it on. My two children, aged 26 and 23, show no signs of feeling in any way obliged to make financial contributions to the cost of my lifestyle. There again, the fault could well lie with me and my wife for calling them the wrong names. ValueMyCV, an algorithm developed by the website Adzuna, can calculate how much you are likely to earn based on their first names. My daughter Anna can expect to make £30,522 and my son Robbie should be on £32,413. To which I again say, if only. Their prospects would have been immeasurably improved if I had called them both Ed. Eds make £61,362. The highest earning woman’s name – still only 318th on the overall list – was Liz at £38,792. I guess the Queen bumps that average up a bit. Still, Anna and Robbie could have done worse. Paiges only earn £20,190 and Reeces make £22,952. Thursday Days like these seem to be coming round ever more frequently in Westminster. There must be entropy in the air. It began with the news that a junior minister no one had heard of was quitting a job no one knew he had. Then Dominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary on the grounds that the deal the Brexit secretary had negotiated was rubbish; quickly followed by Esther McVey trying to sign on for universal credit. Good luck with that. By the end of the day, three more ministers, anonymous even to their close relatives, chose to step down. In the meantime Theresa May put in a marathon three-hour stint at the despatch box in the Commons – probably the only place she could guarantee she would still be prime minister – defending the indefensible. She knows that everyone knows her deal is worse than remaining in the EU and nothing like what she had promised the Brexit fantasists and yet she carried on trying to sell something she couldn’t even sell to at least 10 members of her cabinet. All that her deal has going for it is that it isn’t quite as bad as no deal and it’s clear there is no parliamentary majority for either. And yet she went on. And on. Most people would have needed the afternoon off after a punishment beating like that, but shortly after 5pm she was back giving a press conference in which yet again she had nothing to say. She was there because she was there. Nothing had changed. She would carry on to the bitter end. It was like the final scene from the cult film RoboCop where the anti-hero keeps going while his armour is steadily blasted away under heavy fire. There’s something almost admirable in her stubbornness, in her refusal to engage with reality. But as a strategy, it’s doomed. Friday The outgoing executive chairman of the Football Association, Richard Scudamore, has said he is “embarrassed” that the 20 Premier League clubs are so grateful to him they are each stumping up £250,000 by way of a leaving present. Though not so embarrassed that he refused to accept. Whatever happened to the usual whip-round, leaving card and a John Lewis voucher? It now seems that some people are better off leaving their jobs than actually doing them. The Persimmon boss Jeff Fairburn got his P45 after his £75m bonus became a “distraction”: a distraction from some of the other excessive payouts at the building company. And only this year, at a time when there is a massive hole in the pension pot of Royal Mail workers, the chief executive, Moya Greene, was awarded a £1.3m payout for deciding that the time had come for her to leave. Not for being sacked, just because she had had enough of doing a job for which she was already well remunerated. To add insult to injury, the Royal Mail decided Greene’s successor, Rico Back, who was already working for one of its subsidiary firms, needed a £5.8m sweetener for the pain of being promoted. So I’m putting the Guardian on notice. When I do eventually go, I’m not accepting anything under seven figures. Digested week, digested: Unity in disunity"

          "bodyText": "Call it a stay of execution. Theresa May exists on a different time scale to most ordinary people. While the rest of us try to plan weeks, months – sometimes even years – ahead, the prime minister has a much narrower focus. Minutes, hours and days. Just getting to the end of any given 24-hour period with her job still intact is cause enough for celebration. Even if the cold sweats are sure to begin again at dawn the next day. No wonder then that May seemed relieved – if mentally drained – when she eventually appeared outside Downing Street to give a brief statement. Her Brexit deal, which even she wasn’t sure she fully understood – other than it was better than no deal, worse than what the UK already had and nothing like what she had promised – had survived its first contact with her cabinet. She was still just about in the game. Not that it had been easy. Cabinet had overrun by several hours. Even Alun Cairns – who was he again? – had insisted on droning on. At length. Like all the others, pretending he knew what he was talking about. When it was clear no one did. Then Karen Bradley had needed to check on which bit was Northern Ireland and which was the republic. At which point the government cancelled the press statement only for the government to reinstate the press statement when it emerged that the government didn’t know it hadn’t cancelled the press statement. ITV had live broadcast pictures of the front door for more than five hours. Who knew chaos took quite this long? A metaphor for Brexit itself. “There had been impassioned debate,” May said, looking tight-lipped. As in severe reservations. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey might still resign, but she could live with that. Both fell under the heading of acceptable collateral damage. Come to think of it, their departures might even be an unexpected bonus as she couldn’t remember them ever having done anything useful. If only Chris Grayling would do the decent thing as well, it would be a red-letter day. All the big hitters had stayed on board, though. Dominic Raab had become a pushover ever since his geography lesson and the rest had surrendered to her logic. Her deal was every bit as bad as she had always led them to believe it would be, so if they were to storm out in a strop it would rather imply they had never grasped the details. To make it a full house, the Four Pot Plants had more or less succumbed to her argument that the best way of showing you were taking back control was to hand it all back to the EU. After all, it was consensus of a sort if Remainers and Leavers both disliked her deal. Unity through disunity. Best of all, Tony Blair had even spent the afternoon calling her draft deal ‘a capitulation’. Nobody believed a word he said these days. Not even when he was telling the truth. Prime minister’s questions had also passed off without too much damage being inflicted. It could have been better, mind. It was just typical that Jeremy Corbyn had chosen this day of all days to ask about Brexit. Normally the Labour leader could be relied upon to use his six questions to cross-examine her about bus timetables at a moment of national crisis. But though Corbyn had managed to land a couple of glancing blows on the backstop agreement and the red ink that she had put through her red lines, here had nothing to cause her much grief. Certainly nothing that her uncanny ability to find different ways of failing to answer a question directly couldn’t handle. “Let me be clear,” she had said, as she went on to explain why everyone had always known that what they were voting for in the referendum was any deal she just happened to manage to agree with the EU. Her default denial algorithm was in perfect working order. There had been one minor alarm when Iain Duncan Smith had got to his feet, but it soon turned out that all he wanted was a complete reversal of government policy on the timing of the new £2 top rates for fixed odds betting terminals. That was no bother. Throwing Philip Hammond and Jeremy Wright to the wolves was an unexpected pleasure. All that mattered was the here and now. Just breathe. She’d got all her life to live. She’d got all her love to give. She had survived. She would survive. Until tomorrow at least."

          "headline": "Cars without drivers still need a moral compass. But what kind?",
          "bodyText": "Loved by some philosophers, loathed by others, the so-called trolley problem is the quintessential moral puzzle. A runaway train is heading towards five people tied to a track. You can change a signal, diverting the train down a spur, so saving five lives. Unfortunately, one person is on the spur, and would die. What should you do? Most people – young and old, rich and poor – believe you should divert the train. But what if a runaway train is heading towards five people, again tied to the track, and you are standing on a footbridge overlooking it, next to an overweight man? Once again you can save five lives, but only by toppling the heavy-set man over the bridge: he will die, but he is large enough to slow the train to a stop. What should you do? This time, almost everyone agrees that you should not kill one person to save the five lives. I once asked the great philosopher Mary Midgley, who died last month, what she thought of the trolley problem. It was, she said, “just one more depressing example of academic philosophers’ obsession with concentrating on selected, artificial examples so as to dodge the stress of looking at real issues”. Yet the trolley problem and reality are now on their own collision course. That’s because of autonomous machines – in particular the driverless car, which may be on our streets within a decade or so. Imagine the car is faced with an unavoidable accident – it can swerve one way and hit a child, or another and plough into several adult pedestrians. What should it be programmed to do? There are tough engineering challenges for driverless cars to overcome before they are allowed to operate. But ethical issues might turn out to be the bigger obstacle. If so, that would be bad news. The driverless car will exact significant costs (lorry and taxi drivers will lose their livelihoods), but the benefits will be immense. They include social gains (think of elderly people currently isolated in their homes because they no longer feel confident driving), economic and efficiency gains (an end to all that wasted time behind the wheel) and environmental gains (there will be many fewer cars and more options to car-pool). Just as the invention of the car led to the creation of suburbs, so the driverless car will allow a re-imagination of our urban space. Above all, however, it will be directly life-saving. Around the world, more than 1 million people are killed in car accidents each year, most because of driver error. The driverless car won’t go to the pub, won’t get distracted by its mobile phone, won’t become drowsy at the wheel. So what is to be done? The crucial point is to acknowledge that trolley dilemmas are going to be extremely rare. The driverless car won’t have sluggish, human reaction times. If something unexpected occurs on the road ahead, it will almost always be able to brake in time to avoid a collision. But we still need to work out what to do in those unusual cases where an accident is unavoidable. What kind of morals should be programmed into the machine? What the original trolley problem shows is that most of us are not crude utilitarians – that is, we don’t believe that the best course of action is always to maximise happiness, or to save the maximum number of human lives. If we did, we would see no difference between diverting the train and pushing the man over the bridge. Rather, most of us have Kantian instincts – we object to humans (such as our overweight man) being used merely as a means to an end. However, I think that when it comes to machines we will be more tolerant of their making utilitarian decisions. This is borne out by a recent study that asked what people would do in various iterations of the trolley problem. It suggests that, around the world, people believe the car should save as many lives as possible, though it also revealed some variation in how people in different countries, for example, weighed a young life against an elderly one. Driverless cars are merely one example of the autonomous machines to which we will delegate ethical choices. When should the carebot call for help if a patient is not taking her pills? What degree of risk to civilian life is acceptable before the autonomous missile launches an attack? An added complication is machine-learning – as machines “learn” how to act from repeated actions, they may end up behaving in unforeseen ways. As a result, it will make less and less sense to hold humans culpable for machine action – hence, I predict, our growing preference for utilitarian solutions. If anything, the driverless car is the least problematic of these new dilemmas. Of course, we need to establish who is responsible for the ethics with which a vehicle is programmed, and what the ethical algorithm will be. It would be farcical if passengers or manufacturers were free to choose their car’s morality for themselves, so that, for example, you would select a Kantian Mini Cooper while I opted for a utilitarian Ford Focus. A much more straightforward approach would be for the government to insist upon a general “minimise loss of life” rule. We can then disregard the bizarre questions put by philosophers, variations of “would you rather save two pedestrians or a successful businessperson?” More controversially, the “minimise loss of life” code should apply even when the lives at stake include those of the passengers inside the driverless car. Although people tend to be utilitarian when it comes to the lives of others – preferring to save two strangers rather than one – they are less keen on utilitarian ethics when their own lives are in the balance. Initially, people will be reluctant to use a vehicle that would sacrifice its passengers to save a greater number of other people. If humans were rational, this initial resistance would be fleeting, since the prospect of such an eventuality occurring would be almost infinitesimally small, and overall we will all be much safer in the driverless-car environment than we are now, with fallible humans behind the wheel. In practice, because we are not entirely logical creatures, a public campaign may be required to help shift attitudes. Technology is progressing at a much faster pace than the public conversation about how it should be regulated. Never before have human beings been able to subcontract ethical decisions – including the most serious, involving life and death. We need to work out quickly what ethics should be encoded into autonomous devices, and how machine ethics should be regulated. Otherwise we will delay the arrival of technologies – such as the driverless car – and hold up all the extraordinary benefits they promise. • David Edmonds is a senior research fellow at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and the author of Would You Kill The Fat Man?"

          "bodyText": "One million thank yous to all our wonderful Guardian supporters. Where would we be without you? No, literally: where? You’re the lead in our pencil, the oil in our engine, the wind beneath our … my God, I sound like Boris Johnson. I can’t apologise enough. I will endeavour to continue writing columns that DON’T sound like Boris Johnson – though may sometimes be about him – as long as you will have me. Marina Hyde, Guardian columnist I never cease to be amazed at the loyalty, strength and passion of Guardian supporters and I want to say thank you to each and every one of you. Without your incredible support it would be that much harder to fund the painstaking work of investigations – such as the work we did recently into the treatment of rape survivors in the criminal justice system. Knowing that our readers support our work helped make that series of stories possible, and feedback from our readers gives us the motivation to keep on pushing to find out more and do our part to challenge injustice. Alexandra Topping, senior reporter Most of the time Guardian sport can feel like an extended chat with friends who love, care about and take pleasure in the same things. The rest of the time it can feel like a chat with friends who despise, with every cell of their being, your biased and wrong-headed interpretation of all the things they love, care about and take pleasure in. Sometimes it’s hard to tell which is which, or which is more fun. But the dialogue with readers is something we’ve always done on sport. It is the essence of our online coverage. Barney Ronay, football writer The long investigations I have worked on from modern slavery to corporate tax dodging are expensive in reporting time and legal work. Holding power to account in this way is still possible thanks to the independent financial backing members and supporters have given us. And when people with deep pockets use the law to try to silence us, knowing that readers are right behind us keeps us going. Felicity Lawrence, special correspondent Thanks to contributions from readers, the Guardian’s arts coverage remains proudly independent, dictated by our writers’ and editors’ taste and experience, not powerful institutions or wealthy stars. Our critics are able to travel around the country and beyond to seek out brilliance in every art form, and to investigate the stories behind the work – from funding to censorship. Alex Needham, Arts editor This has been the most intense and extraordinary period of British political upheaval in a lifetime. In little over two years, our team has covered a referendum, a leadership challenge, late-night Brexit negotiations, a snap election, a hung parliament, high-stakes summits, MP rebellions and the departure of more than a dozen ministers. In the chaotic and unpredictable months ahead, as we edge closer to the Brexit deadline in March, the support of Guardian readers is invaluable for powering our reporting. Jessica Elgot, political correspondent At a time when the world order as we know it is collapsing, and nations gaze both inwards and outwards with confusion, doubt and fear, it’s essential to tell stories without agenda and hold elites to account without anxiety. It’s only with the support of our readers, who share our values and our mission, that we’re able to do this. The Guardian isn’t just a newspaper, it’s an ethos and an identity. That’s more powerful than any press baron will ever be. Nadia Khomami, news reporter and editor The thing that surprises people most when I talk to them about Guardian Australia is that we are not owned by anyone. No one tells us what to write, what stories to report on, or who to investigate. We are truly independent. That’s what makes them interested if they have not read us before. But those who do read us – and those who increasingly support us – know the value of this independence in the media landscape in which we live. They know the value of having a free-thinking, unattached news organisation that can look into places others don’t because of commercial or proprietorial interest. They trust us, and our fantastic team pays back that trust through truly excellent and unique reporting. David Munk, deputy editor, Guardian Australia What I love most about Guardian readers is the intensity of their relationship with us. You’re there to cheer us on when we do well, support us when we are threatened, berate us when we let you down, and to remind us of our values when we forget. The intensity of that relationship has only deepened since you started supporting us financially, not just by buying the paper. In some ways it feels like an uneasy relationship, but there is also a purity to it – you’re giving money because you believe in us, not because we’re selling a product. On Telethon Day, I always come in scared, thinking I’ll muck up the donations system and be incompetent on the phone but – like everybody else – I leave the building loving you lot, feeling better about the world, and boring people to death about how we have the best readers in the world. Simon Hattenstone, features writer Our readers have been supporting in depth reporting on gun violence through our Break the Cycle project, which has enabled us to produce distinctive work in an area plagued with partisan rhetoric and political inaction. Our readers contributed more than $200,000 to make this year-long project possible. And when 17 people – students and teachers – were murdered at a high school in Parkland, Florida, earlier in the year we invited a group of teenage survivors to guest edit our website. It was an extraordinary reporting experience that prioritised both the voices of survivors and gave a platform to a group of student journalists with a unique perspective on gun violence. None of this would have been possible without reader contributions. Oliver Laughland, senior reporter, Guardian US Last year I spent months locked in a room working on what would eventually become the Paradise Papers project. It’s thanks to supporters that I get the chance to take the time I need for investigations like that, and feel free to write whatever stories are there. Hilary Osborne, reporter As someone who writes daily about the NHS – a subject of huge interest to Guardian readers – I get something of significant value in my work from them beyond the financial contributions which help fund our journalism. Because a fair number of readers work in and around the NHS, I am lucky in that I quite often receive useful tip-offs. Readers taking the time to contact me has led directly to stories, one or two of which have ended up on the front page. This ongoing soft intelligence about the NHS really helps me in my work. Denis Campbell, health policy editor Reader support allows us to have a totally unique short documentary strand on our site that’s unlike anything else you can find on a news website. We know that our readers like us to try different things and to be brave in the format of our storytelling and their support means we can have the freedom to have this ambitious film strand. Charlie Phillips, head of Guardian documentaries I really like the feeling that I can keep returning to subjects close to my heart: justice for women, because I know there is support out there to do so. Whether it’s #MeToo, Kavanaugh or writing about low convictions for rape trials, I know that there are stories we need to keep returning to, that bit by bit we continue to fight the backlash. It’s wonderful to part of that network. It means that even in the darkest of times we hold our nerve. Thank you. Suzanne Moore, Guardian columnist There’s an assumption that fashion journalism writes itself. But reporting on it in a discerning and questioning way, and with an eye on diversity and getting the angle other publications don’t, requires several things: time, resources, manpower, and with that, the chance to go out and see what people are showing, doing and actually wearing. That’s what makes fashion worth writing about. Morwenna Ferrier, fashion editor When I started work in Washington, I never expected to be branded an enemy of the people by the US president. But that fate befell what he calls the “fake news” media covering Donald Trump’s White House. Each day serves up a bombardment of norm-busting conduct, hirings and firings, Twitter distractions and the question: can he really do that? Trump has reminded us why freedom of expression and holding the powerful to account are fundamental. Amid this maelstrom, I am forever grateful for the curiosity, support and solidarity of Guardian readers. They prick the infamous Washington bubble and keep us on our toes. They remind us what’s at stake for America and the world. David Smith, Washington DC bureau chief Newspapers can’t take on long, open-ended reporting projects unless they have a well-staffed newsroom that allows reporters the time to follow their instincts and investigate issues which look like they might be important. At a time when many newspapers are struggling financially, the support from Guardian readers has been vital in helping keep the newsroom well-resourced. Amelia Gentleman, reporter Untainted by a controlling press baron or commercial proprietor, our political and social coverage is our own, with no party line, but a rainbow of views where all shades of liberal and left people meet to think, talk, write and often hotly dispute. Only our readers support keeps us intellectually free – and free online for readers everywhere. Polly Toynbee, Guardian columnist Support from Guardian readers is crucial to our investigative journalism. Readers are a source of stories, tips, feedback, ideas and enlightenment. Crucially, they offer moral and financial support for our work, at a time when reporters are under threat globally. Luke Harding, foreign correspondent In the six months since I took over as the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, I have been on the ground to cover some of the most urgent humanitarian stories in the region. None of this first-hand, people-focused reporting would have been possible without the support of our readers. And to them I say: obrigado, gracias, thank you! We could not do it without you. Tom Phillips, Latin America correspondent The only reason our project on US public lands exists is that readers believed in it. It was launched after a massive crowdfunding appeal in 2017 that raised more than $110,000. Now our reporting is being cited by US politicians and republished by newspapers across the American west. Alastair Gee, homelessness and public lands editor for Guardian US As an institutionalised lifer on the Guardian’s multiple award-winning Football Weekly podcast, I think I vouch for all involved when I say how much we appreciate the support of our listeners, whether it is those who throw a few bob in the online cyber-hat or pay actual money to come to watch us on stage as we pontificate at our regular live shows. Although you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, producing football opinion doesn’t come cheap and we appreciate the support of each and every one of our listeners. Barry Glendenning, deputy sports editor Technology companies make up seven of the ten largest in the world. They have thousands of employees dedicated to ensuring that the only stories that get told about them are the ones they approve of – and often they succeed. But with the help of Guardian supporters, we finally have the numbers on our side to take them to task: to keep an eye out for “dark adverts” on Facebook, to find out when Apple’s trying to pass off substandard products as just the odd error, or to see if YouTube’s algorithm really does tend towards extremism. Alex Hern, Technology reporter What a debt we owe to Guardian readers Funding our news and comment and leaders Helping us report on thieves and crooks Sport and science, art and books Nurturing an industry that’s close to failing With contributions and the cheques they mail in Giving us the means to relentlessly Investigate injustice and the powers that be To champion the underdog and people who need us Where would we be without Guardian readers? Mark Rice-Oxley, head of special projects For the 3.5 million or so EU citizens living in the UK to the one million or so British people living in Europe, Brexit has real and looming consequences, and many have turned to the Guardian to reflect and report on their fears and their experiences.We will remain vigilant in our reporting of them post-Brexit. Lisa O’Carroll, Brexit correspondent I’m so grateful to all the readers who support the Guardian, because they enable me to tell the stories I’ve always wanted to tell; from interviewing the father of a Sandy Hook victim to talking to Samantha Mathis, River Phoenix’s girlfriend who was with him when he died and who had never before told the story of what happened to him. Hadley Freeman, Guardian columnist It makes all the difference in the world to be pursuing journalism that is not beholden to an oligarch, a tycoon or a corporation. It is everything to know that we are being supported in what we do by people whose only demand is to try to get to the truth and understand it. My proudest moment in any interview or conversation in Washington is when I’m asked who owns the Guardian, and I can truly say that “we do”. Julian Borger, world affairs editor I am constantly humbled by how generous our readers can be. When I wrote about sharing my house in Manchester with Yasser, a Syrian refugee, we were inundated with offers of support. A teacher training charity offered him a free place on their course, a college offered him unlimited English lessons. Three years on, Yasser has been reunited with his family in Manchester and is thriving. He will not forget the generosity shown to him by Guardian readers. Helen Pidd, North of England editor Guardian supporters come to us for bold voices who can offer hope and a path forward in these dark times. Bernie Sanders and Yanis Varoufakis wrote a pair of twinned op-eds for The Guardian proposing an international progressive alliance in response. Just a month later, they announced that they would be taking that idea, first proposed in this paper, and making it happen. Amana Fontanella-Khan, Opinion editor, The Guardian US"

          "bodyText": "In May, a video appeared on the internet of Donald Trump offering advice to the people of Belgium on the issue of climate change. “As you know, I had the balls to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement,” he said, looking directly into the camera, “and so should you.” The video was created by a Belgian political party, Socialistische Partij Anders, or sp.a, and posted on sp.a’s Twitter and Facebook. It provoked hundreds of comments, many expressing outrage that the American president would dare weigh in on Belgium’s climate policy. One woman wrote: “Humpy Trump needs to look at his own country with his deranged child killers who just end up with the heaviest weapons in schools.” Another added: “Trump shouldn’t blow so high from the tower because the Americans are themselves as dumb.” But this anger was misdirected. The speech, it was later revealed, was nothing more than a hi-tech forgery. Sp.a claimed that they had commissioned a production studio to use machine learning to produce what is known as a “deep fake” – a computer-generated replication of a person, in this case Trump, saying or doing things they have never said or done. Sp.a’s intention was to use the fake video to grab people’s attention, then redirect them to an online petition calling on the Belgian government to take more urgent climate action. The video’s creators later said they assumed that the poor quality of the fake would be enough to alert their followers to its inauthenticity. “It is clear from the lip movements that this is not a genuine speech by Trump,” a spokesperson for sp.a told Politico. As it became clear that their practical joke had gone awry, sp.a’s social media team went into damage control. “Hi Theo, this is a playful video. Trump didn’t really make these statements.” “Hey, Dirk, this video is supposed to be a joke. Trump didn’t really say this.” The party’s communications team had clearly underestimated the power of their forgery, or perhaps overestimated the judiciousness of their audience. Either way, this small, left-leaning political party had, perhaps unwittingly, provided a deeply troubling example of the use of manipulated video online in an explicitly political context. It was a small-scale demonstration of how this technology might be used to threaten our already vulnerable information ecosystem – and perhaps undermine the possibility of a reliable, shared reality. Fake videos can now be created using a machine learning technique called a “generative adversarial network”, or a GAN. A graduate student, Ian Goodfellow, invented GANs in 2014 as a way to algorithmically generate new types of data out of existing data sets. For instance, a GAN can look at thousands of photos of Barack Obama, and then produce a new photo that approximates those photos without being an exact copy of any one of them, as if it has come up with an entirely new portrait of the former president not yet taken. GANs might also be used to generate new audio from existing audio, or new text from existing text – it is a multi-use technology. The use of this machine learning technique was mostly limited to the AI research community until late 2017, when a Reddit user who went by the moniker “Deepfakes” – a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake” – started posting digitally altered pornographic videos. He was building GANs using TensorFlow, Google’s free open source machine learning software, to superimpose celebrities’ faces on the bodies of women in pornographic movies. A number of media outlets reported on the porn videos, which became known as “deep fakes”. In response, Reddit banned them for violating the site’s content policy against involuntary pornography. By this stage, however, the creator of the videos had released FakeApp, an easy-to-use platform for making forged media. The free software effectively democratized the power of GANs. Suddenly, anyone with access to the internet and pictures of a person’s face could generate their own deep fake. When Danielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland, first became aware of the fake porn movies, she was initially struck by how viscerally they violated these women’s right to privacy. But once she started thinking about deep fakes, she realized that if they spread beyond the trolls on Reddit they could be even more dangerous. They could be weaponized in ways that weaken the fabric of democratic society itself. “I started thinking about my city, Baltimore,” she told me. “In 2015, the place was a tinderbox after the killing of Freddie Gray. So, I started to imagine what would’ve happened if a deep fake emerged of the chief of police saying something deeply racist at that moment. The place would’ve exploded.” Citron, along with her colleague Bobby Chesney, began working on a report outlining the extent of the potential danger. As well as considering the threat to privacy and national security, both scholars became increasingly concerned that the proliferation of deep fakes could catastrophically erode trust between different factions of society in an already polarized political climate. In particular, they could foresee deep fakes being exploited by purveyors of “fake news”. Anyone with access to this technology – from state-sanctioned propagandists to trolls – would be able to skew information, manipulate beliefs, and in so doing, push ideologically opposed online communities deeper into their own subjective realities. “The marketplace of ideas already suffers from truth decay as our networked information environment interacts in toxic ways with our cognitive biases,” the report reads. “Deep fakes will exacerbate this problem significantly.” Citron and Chesney are not alone in these fears. In April, the film director Jordan Peele and BuzzFeed released a deep fake of Barack Obama calling Trump a “total and complete dipshit” to raise awareness about how AI-generated synthetic media might be used to distort and manipulate reality. In September, three members of Congress sent a letter to the director of national intelligence, raising the alarm about how deep fakes could be harnessed by “disinformation campaigns in our elections”. The specter of politically motivated deep fakes disrupting elections is at the top of Citron’s concerns. “What keeps me awake at night is a hypothetical scenario where, before the vote in Texas, someone releases a deep fake of Beto O’Rourke having sex with a prostitute, or something,” Citron told me. “Now, I know that this would be easily refutable, but if this drops the night before, you can’t debunk it before serious damage has spread.” She added: “I’m starting to see how a well-timed deep fake could very well disrupt the democratic process.” While these disturbing hypotheticals might be easy to conjure, Tim Hwang, director of the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative, is not willing to bet on deep fakes having a high impact on elections in the near future. Hwang has been studying the spread of misinformation on online networks for a number of years, and, with the exception of the small-stakes Belgian incident, he is yet to see any examples of truly corrosive incidents of deep fakes “in the wild”. Hwang believes that that this is partly because using machine learning to generate convincing fake videos still requires a degree of expertise and lots of data. “If you are a propagandist, you want to spread your work as far as possible with the least amount of effort,” he said. “Right now, a crude Photoshop job could be just as effective as something created with machine learning.” At the same time, Hwang acknowledges that as deep fakes become more realistic and easier to produce in the coming years, they could usher in an era of forgery qualitatively different from what we have seen before. “We have long been able to doctor images and movies,” he said. “But in the past, if you wanted to make a video of the president saying something he didn’t say, you needed a team of experts. Machine learning will not only automate this process, it will also probably make better forgeries.” Couple this with the fact that access to this technology will spread over the internet, and suddenly you have, as Hwang put it, “a perfect storm of misinformation”. Nonetheless, research into machine learning-powered synthetic media forges ahead. In August, an international team of researchers affiliated with Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Informatics unveiled a technique for producing what they called “deep video portraits”, a sort of facial ventriloquism, where one person can take control of another person’s face and make it say or do things at will. A video accompanying the research paper depicted a researcher opening his mouth and a corresponding moving image of Barack Obama opening his mouth; the researcher then moves his head to the side, and so does synthetic Obama. Christian Theobalt, a researcher involved in the study, told me via email that he imagines deep video portraits will be used most effectively for accurate dubbing in foreign films, advanced face editing techniques for post-production in film, and special effects. In a press release that accompanied the original paper, the researchers acknowledged potential misuse of their technology, but emphasized how their approach – capable of synthesizing faces that look “nearly indistinguishable from ground truth” – could make “a real difference to the visual entertainment industry”. Hany Farid, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that although the machine learning-powered breakthroughs in computer graphics are impressive, researchers should be more cognizant of the broader social and political ramifications of what they’re creating. “The special effects community will love these new technologies,” Farid told me. “But outside of this world, outside of Hollywood, it is not clear to me that the positive implications outweigh the negative.” Farid, who has spent the past 20 years developing forensic technology to identify digital forgeries, is currently working on new detection methods to counteract the spread of deep fakes. One of Farid’s recent breakthroughs has been focusing on subtle changes of color that occur in the face as blood is pumped in and out. The signal is so minute that the machine learning software is unable to pick it up – at least for now. As the threat of deep fakes intensifies, so do efforts to produce new detection methods. In June, researchers from the University at Albany (SUNY) published a paper outlining how fake videos could be identified by a lack of blinking in synthetic subjects. Facebook has also committed to developing machine learning models to detect deep fakes. But Farid is wary. Relying on forensic detection alone to combat deep fakes is becoming less viable, he believes, due to the rate at which machine learning techniques can circumvent them. “It used to be that we’d have a couple of years between coming up with a detection technique and the forgers working around it. Now it only takes two to three months.” This, he explains, is due to the flexibility of machine learning. “All the programmer has to do is update the algorithm to look for, say, changes of color in the face that correspond with the heartbeat, and then suddenly, the fakes incorporate this once imperceptible sign.” (For this reason, Farid chose not to share some of his more recent forensic breakthroughs with me. “Once I spill on the research, all it takes is one asshole to add it to their system.”) Although Farid is locked in this technical cat-and-mouse game with deep fake creators, he is aware that the solution does not lie in new technology alone. “The problem isn’t just that deep fake technology is getting better,” he said. “It is that the social processes by which we collectively come to know things and hold them to be true or untrue are under threat.” Indeed, as the fake video of Trump that spread through social networks in Belgium earlier this year demonstrated, deep fakes don’t need to be undetectable or even convincing to be believed and do damage. It is possible that the greatest threat posed by deep fakes lies not in the fake content itself, but in the mere possibility of their existence. This is a phenomenon that scholar Aviv Ovadya has called “reality apathy”, whereby constant contact with misinformation compels people to stop trusting what they see and hear. In other words, the greatest threat isn’t that people will be deceived, but that they will come to regard everything as deception. Recent polls indicate that trust in major institutions and the media is dropping. The proliferation of deep fakes, Ovadya says, is likely to exacerbate this trend. According to Danielle Citron, we are already beginning to see the social ramifications of this epistemic decay. “Ultimately, deep fakes are simply amplifying what I call the liar’s dividend,” she said. “When nothing is true then the dishonest person will thrive by saying what’s true is fake.” This article has been amended to clarify that though sp.a initially claimed it used machine learning technology to create its fake Trump clip, it was later revealed that the video was made using After Effects, an editing software"

          "bodyText": "“In the UK, we are spending £97bn of public money on treating disease and only £8bn preventing it,” the health secretary Matt Hancock said last week. “You don’t have to be an economist to see those numbers don’t stack up.” But Matt Hancock actually is an economist, so how does he know? I suppose he might have canvassed the views of some non-economists, but I’m sceptical about how rigorous that survey can have been. “Hi Chris, Linda…” (good to get a gender balance) “… have you got a second?” Hancock may have asked his aides. “Of course, minister.” “You did classics and history respectively, right?” “That’s right.” (Chris is doing all the talking – come on, Linda!) “Great, so we’re spending £97bn on treating disease and only £8bn preventing it. Can you see that those numbers don’t stack up?” “Oh yes, absolutely,” says Chris. “Yes indeed, minister,” adds Linda. It is possible that on such flimsy evidence rests the secretary of state’s claim that “you don’t have to be an economist to see those numbers don’t stack up”. And obviously they do stack up. As in, you could stack them up – you could add them together. They probably are stacked up in various summaries of government spending: stacked up under the heading “Health”. You don’t have to be an economist to see that if you stacked them up, that would make £105bn. I don’t think he means that, though. I think maybe he means that £97bn is much more than £8bn. His point may simply be that you don’t have to be an economist to see that 97 is a larger number than eight. If so, I heartily agree and my only quibble is why, even with Britain’s rising life expectancy, for which Matt Hancock is doubtless keen to take credit, he considered that assertion worth the time it took to express. To be fair, I think what he’s getting at is that, if we spent more than £8bn on preventing illness, maybe we wouldn’t need to spend as much as £97bn treating it. Unfortunately, though, you don’t have to be an economist to know whether that contention stacks up. In fact, you have to be something else. You need a completely different type of expertise. And, in an ideal world you’d want every extra pound spent on prevention to save more than a pound spent on treatment – otherwise you’re just swapping money about. Matt Hancock clearly reckons it would, and it seems plausible up to a point, but it’s not as obvious as knowing that 97 is more than eight and the naughty man is trying to make us think it is. What I don’t believe, by the way, is that, if you spent £97bn on prevention, you’d hardly have to spend anything at all on treatment. And, even if that did happen, it would be a disaster because it would quickly become impossible to defend the £97bn. It would look like it was being frittered away on nothing. People hate spending a fortune on fire prevention unless they can see that lots of things are on fire. This is a problem constantly faced by those who seek to justify counter-terrorism spending. If they foil all the plots, no one appreciates them. So they keep the alert level scary and bang on about how many plots they’re foiling. I’m sure they’re telling the truth (by which I mean: they may be telling the truth), but there’s no doubt that it’s failing to foil terrorist plots, rather than foiling them, that has the greatest government purse-string loosening effect. This isn’t a problem for Matt Hancock because I don’t think justifying greater health spending is his primary aim. So what is his aim? The context for his remarks was the launch of a Department of Health “vision document” entitled Prevention Is Better Than Cure. No one could argue with that idea. But when politicians go around saying something with which no one could possibly disagree, there’s usually something with which millions absolutely would lurking beneath it. And so it proved. “For too long, the NHS has seen itself essentially as the National Hospital Service,” he told the Today programme. He reckons that’s wrong because only “a fifth of the determinants of the length of your healthy lifespan are caused by what goes on in hospitals”. A fifth! And yet the hospitals cost so much! The majority of the country’s health budget is being lavished on institutions that affect a mere fifth of the… you know… the determinants of the healthy thing. That’s ridiculous! Why spend a fortune on hospitals for people to die in when they could just as easily get run over by buses? Why waste money on intensive care units when, for the same money, you could print a seemingly infinite number of leaflets warning about salt? Not leaflets though! I’m such a Luddite! Hancock is talking about “predictive prevention”, which, according to the departmental document “will transform public health by harnessing digital technology and personal data”. Just as people get targeted marketing from Amazon or Facebook, this will be “targeted health advice – specifically designed for their demographic and their location”. This is such a Tory idea. Let’s learn from the private sector! We can replace those pricey hospitals with algorithms! That way, a computer can precisely instruct people on how not to get ill – and the fact that there will hardly be any hospitals will be an added incentive! By all means, let’s encourage healthy lifestyles. It also makes sense (a better idea in the document) to offer genetic analysis so patients can be warned about health risks specific to their DNA. But the commercial technique of exploiting personal data to target advertising is a trick and a government department shouldn’t aspire to trick people even if it thinks it’s for their own good. The health education the state provides should be the objective scientific truth about the causes of illness. It should be widely accessible, but not marketed, nor expressed differently according to what type of citizen a computer reckons will read it. That approach would be as contemptuous of the public as a corporation is of its customers and another way by which inconvenient truths are transformed in people’s minds into fake news."

Muse’s eighth album title tilts at the notion; tracks called Thought Contagion and Algorithm, meanwhile, reinforce the impression that the Devonian trio continue to play the canaries in our impending apocalypse. Muse, though, are great at simulations. When they’re not sounding like a dystopian prog opera scored by Jean-Michel Jarre, they can whip out surprisingly sexy machine funk. On their fourth album it was Supermassive Black Hole. Here, it’s a monster called Propaganda, which starts with fart-bass and resolves into Prince’s Kiss. Break It to Me fashions breakbeats out of machine parts and what sounds like a ghostly theremin, while the catchy Pressure has not only an earworm of a riff but Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Terry Crews in the video. This is Muse very much in VR play mode, riffing hard on their love of 80s visual culture – a recurring theme in the interlocking videos. No track here breaks the five-minute mark; only Something Human lets the side down with an acoustic guitar."

          "headline": "One day. Six operations. Three kidneys. The story of an organ donor chain",
          "bodyText": "On the morning of 13 September 2017, Martha Myers was being prepared for surgery at north London’s Royal Free hospital. Stayin’ Alive was playing in the background. The anaesthetist had asked what she would like to hear, and she’d requested the Bee Gees – calming, “happy music” that took her back to her youth in Colombia. Meanwhile, 130 miles north, in Nottingham City hospital, Ryan Mace grappled with a pair of green surgical stockings, worrying that his gown would reveal his bottom as he walked to theatre. He’d wanted to do something like this since he was a teenager and now that the moment was here, he was ready. Back in London, south of the river at St George’s hospital, Steve Abbott had woken up feeling anxious. But his was a good ward to be on, full of high-spirited football chat that kept his mind off the day ahead. When the time for the operation finally came, he squeezed his son Ben’s hand before being wheeled away. Martha, Ryan and Steve were in perfect health. But over the course of the morning, surgeons at the three hospitals tussled gently with fatty tissue and chopped through blood vessels to remove a kidney from each of them. The organs were packed in ice and whisked down corridors, then handed to couriers eager to get on the road. Later that day, the theatre staff were back at work. Martha’s kidney had arrived in Nottingham, where it was transplanted into Ryan’s best friend, Lee Bennett. Ryan’s kidney went down the M1 to south London, and was given to Steve’s son Ben. And Steve’s kidney made the short journey across the Thames to be stitched into Martha’s husband, David. The circle was complete. This is the strange magic of kidney donation chains. If you need a transplant in the UK, you can join 5,000 other people on the national waiting list for a kidney from a deceased donor. Or, if you’re lucky, a partner, relative or friend might offer you one as a living donor (for many people, as long as they have been fully assessed, it is possible to live healthily with only one kidney). But if you and they are incompatible by blood group or tissue type, a transplant may not be possible. Instead, you and your would-be donor can join the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme (pdf). Four times a year, in what’s known as a matching run, a sophisticated algorithm works out chains linking incompatible pairs such as Martha and David, Ryan and Lee, and Steve and Ben. Reshuffled into compatible pairs, everyone in the chain who needs one ends up getting a kidney – not from their friend or loved one, but from a stranger. The process relies on logistical masterminding by staff at the UK’s 23 transplant centres, as much as it does on the mind-boggling computer science it’s built around. Ideally, all the operations in a chain are scheduled to take place on the same day, within eight weeks of a matching run, and only after everyone has been painstakingly assessed to ensure the matches will work and they are well enough for surgery. It’s a curiously under-recognised scheme, among the general public at least, but its impact is growing every year. The first UK kidney exchange took place in 2007, with a two-way swap between four people. In 2017/18, 127 of the 1,010 living kidney transplants carried out – one in eight – came about as a result of the sharing scheme. It’s also a British success story: the UK far outstrips any other country in Europe in this field, carrying out about half of all the transplants made possible by sharing schemes. * * * Just over a year after their surgery, five of the six members of one chain have agreed to meet to talk about their experiences and be photographed for the Guardian. (The sixth, Steve, lives in the US and joins us via FaceTime; later he will be digitally added to the magazine’s group shots.) Though some patients and donors matched in chains end up exchanging cards or letters after the transplants are complete, only a tiny proportion ever meet: anonymity is an important part of the process. “Nice bunch of good-looking people!” says Martha as she and David come into the photo studio, where Lee and Ryan are waiting with their partners. As the writer who arranged this, I had been apprehensive about the meeting, fearing it might be awkward. But when I introduce 43-year-old Lee to Martha, 60, as the man who got her kidney, she grips him by the hand, pulls him to her in an embrace and begins to sob softly. “Nice to meet you,” he says, a broad smile on his face. “I’m looking after it for you.” They get chatting. Was he ever on dialysis, Martha asks: she supported her husband through nearly nine years of it before his first transplant in 1999; when that kidney began to fail, she was determined to donate one herself, rather than see him so ill again. No, Lee says, but he was on the brink: “You came up trumps just in time.” Ben slips into the room 10 minutes later, all but unnoticed as the group exchange recovery stories and praise for the NHS. He and Ryan, his donor, greet each other with a warm blokeishness, a firm handshake and an exchanged, “All right?” There’s an easy amiability in the room. David, 70, is an amateur expert on all things kidney-related and quickly established as the unofficial elder statesman of the group, while Ben, 27, is affable, dry-witted and hungover. Their conversations reveal a shared understanding of ill health and the joy that successful treatment can bring. “With my first transplant,” David announces to the group, minutes after arriving, “I knew it was from a woman because the minute I started peeing I was sitting down on the toilet.” They talk about the thing they all remember about the day of the surgery: one of the donors had misunderstood the instructions to drink only clear fluids and enjoyed a cup of tea with milk in the morning, causing an unnerving last-minute delay. “I was literally yards away from the operating table,” Ryan remembers. “All I could think about was Lee.” The culprit, it’s soon revealed, was Martha, winningly irrepressible whether she’s holding forth on the need for greater kindness in the world or sniffing back tears. “I love her,” Lee’s wife Karen says to me at one point. “I want to take her home.” Away from the bustle of tea being made and the photographer arranging his shots, Lee and Ryan sit side by side, legs crossed identically over their knees. They have known each other only five years, but consider themselves best friends. Both grew up in villages near Nottingham, and later worked out that they had played rugby against each other at school. “We’ve got the same silly sense of humour, similar interests. We just hit it off,” Ryan, 42, says. “He’s such a relaxed person – I’ve learned a lot from him.” But in the time they’d known each other, Lee, who runs a kitchen design business, had been getting increasingly ill. At the age of 28, soon after returning from honeymoon, he discovered he had polycystic kidneys, an inherited condition that his mother, who died when he was 18 of a brain tumour, had suffered from, too. Karen would have given him a kidney if she could, but already knew she had only one good one herself. Ryan, who works for the Royal Air Force in recruitment and selection, was quick to step in. “For me, it was a no-brainer,” he says. “The experts told me I was going to be fine, so why wouldn’t I try to help somebody? Seeing how Lee’s health was deteriorating, there was never a question in my mind.” He cried after seeing Lee for the first time post-surgery. “It was just relief, I think,” he says. “The big thing for me was his eyes. As we’d got closer to the date of the operation, they were quite dark and sunken. When I saw him afterwards, it was like a different guy.” He has kept his green surgical socks; looking at them makes him smile. Lee still finds it hard to grasp that a friend would do what Ryan did. “It’s taken me back to being twentysomething again,” he says. “It feels like a miracle cure.” * * * The main business of the kidney is to remove toxins and excess fluids from the blood and turn the waste into urine; when they don’t, those things remain in the body, causing symptoms including high blood pressure, extreme tiredness and persistent headaches. Left untreated, kidney failure is eventually fatal. Aside from a transplant, dialysis – which filters the blood using either a machine or the inside lining of the abdomen – is the main treatment; but it only partially compensates for lost kidney function, is disruptive to daily life and can cause unpleasant side-effects. Transplants save and transform lives. “Kidney disease and dialysis affect everything that we would take for granted in life,” explains Lisa Burnapp, NHS Blood and Transplant’s lead nurse for living donation. “They can impact on your work, your ability to have children, what you can eat and drink, where you go on holiday.” And while the average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor has fallen to just over two years, a living kidney is preferable – because it comes from a healthy person and can be transplanted in a planned fashion. It’s often described as the Rolls-Royce of transplants. I joined Burnapp at Guy’s hospital in London on a sunny morning earlier this year, as she looked through the results of a matching run carried out the day before. The algorithm, developed by Glasgow University’s school of computing science, identifies several different types of swap. There are circular exchanges between either two or three pairs, but also chains started by altruistic donors – people who simply want to donate a kidney to anyone who needs it, rather than for someone close to them. These are gamechangers, Burnapp told me, because one of them can enable up to three transplants to take place, with one kidney ending up with a patient on the main waiting list. Altruistic donors on the register used to be given the chance to opt into the matching runs. But from this year, in a bid to increase transplant numbers, they have been added automatically – unless there’s a high-priority, difficult-to-match patient on the waiting list for whom they’re a “golden ticket”. We peered at Burnapp’s laptop: the matching run had been triggered at 10.39am plus 10 seconds. One hour, 32 minutes and 32 seconds later, the algorithm had sifted through 271 patients and their pairs to identify 82 transplants, including 17 three-way exchanges. It’s the highest number of transplants yet to be identified in a run. Exciting, said Burnapp, and proof that efforts to develop the scheme are working. “To me it’s really heart-lifting, because these are patients who would never see a transplant. It just means everything, really.” Since the living kidney scheme started in 2007, about 2,000 patients have registered on it, and more than 900 people have benefited from a transplant – including 19 children, the youngest aged three. As well as meeting a chain who have had surgery, I want to speak to a pair who are currently going through the process. I meet Richard and Maureen Ventre at the Royal Liverpool hospital with their donor coordinator, Ann Strong, 12 days before Maureen is due to give a kidney that will mean Richard gets a much-needed transplant. The retired managing director of a family construction business, he was diagnosed with a collapsed kidney in 2016. It was a shock: unlike a lot of kidney disease, his problems came on quickly. “It’s like you’ve got a nice lively battery in you and all of a sudden it’s just gone,” he says. He and Maureen met in the heatwave of 1976, working a summer season in a grand Georgian hotel in Torquay. He was a 23-year-old student from Liverpool and she, aged 17, had come all the way from Glasgow. The scousers, geordies and Glaswegians always seemed to gravitate towards each other, they remember, and one night they found themselves out on a double date. Today, they have the calm, quiet closeness of a couple who have been married for almost four decades. Six years ago the Ventres lost the eldest of their four children, Tim; he drowned in a pool in El Salvador at the age of 30. He was a traveller, Richard explains, and they would love to follow in his footsteps; south-east Asia, maybe, off the beaten track. They aren’t sure that will be possible now, but they keep it in mind. Maureen, who worked until recently in admissions at a local college, is twinkly-eyed and chatty, but when I ask about her decision to donate, her face crumples up with tears and no words come out. “It’s just obvious,” she eventually mutters. “No, it wasn’t hard.” In fact, she and Richard, 59 and 65 respectively, are compatible, so her kidney could have gone straight to him; but they decided to use the sharing scheme in the hope of getting him an even better match. This is encouraged: the more pairs in the pool, the more transplants are likely. They are now in a long altruistic (and anonymous) donor chain: Richard’s new kidney will come from the altruistic donor and Maureen’s will go to a patient in another pair, whose donor’s kidney will then go to someone on the waiting list. At 8am on the dot on the morning of their surgery, Strong gets a call on her mobile from the hospital Richard’s kidney is coming from; everything looks OK there. She checks in with the centre that will receive Maureen’s kidney; it’s also good to go. I join her in theatre later. The kidney must be cut and cauterised away from the yellowy fat that surrounds it until only the vein, arteries and ureter are holding it in place; the persistent snipping of the cutting tool rings out in the cool hush of the room. The keyhole surgery is done via three 1cm incisions, the surgeon, Ajay Sharma, wielding the instruments while the registrar holds the camera (the kidney will come out of a larger cut, around 7cm long). They stand almost shoulder to shoulder, never taking their eyes off the large screen above them, the pink of the tangle of kidney and fat it shows reflected in their glasses. Dan Ridgway, the second surgeon, watches from the sidelines. “These are the ones that keep me awake at night because, essentially, you’re a healthy person having an operation you don’t need,” he says. “I don’t even call them patients. They’re VIPs.” In the afternoon, he’ll be the one fixing Richard Ventre’s new kidney into place. Once the arteries are clamped and cut, it’s crucial for the health of the kidney that it’s removed as soon as possible. The time each is done is recorded on a whiteboard. “Time on the board, artery one,” Ridgway says. “12.06,” comes the instruction from Strong to a nurse. At 12.09, they repeat the process for the second artery. The vein is cut last, and suddenly, at 12.10, a bowl containing the kidney is thrust towards Ridgway. His task now is to swiftly cool it and flush out the blood. A tall man, he sits hunched over a trolley at the foot of the operating table, sets the kidney in a bed of sterile ice and uses tweezers to locate an artery. Hanging beside him is a bag of perfusing fluid – the liquid used to wash out the kidney – and once he has the artery between his thumb and forefinger, the registrar inserts a tube. The fluid rushes in and the water in the bowl gradually turns red as the blood flows out. The kidney gets paler. “It’s lovely to see it come to life when they transplant it,” Strong says, “because it goes in that colour and then pinks up.” Ridgway skilfully peels away the remaining fat and clips it off with long, curved scissors. “A good-sized kidney,” he says, giving it a little squeeze. The organ is triple-bagged, floating in perfusing fluid, and Strong buries it in an icebox. Ridgway gets a text from the surgeon who has removed the kidney that is going to Richard Ventre. “Everything fine,” it says. “Good luck.” Down the neon-lit corridor, the courier is already waiting for us and, as soon as the paperwork is filled in, she’s off, back down in the lifts and towards the hospital where the next patient in the chain is waiting. It’s 12.31pm. You can get a kidney pretty much anywhere in the UK in four hours, Strong says. Couriers will often use blue lights, and the organs are flown between cities for longer journeys. “Every hour counts,” she says. “The longer it’s out of the body, the slower it might be to work.” Just after 4.30pm, Ridgway – who’s been to Anfield to buy a Liverpool away kit for his son during the surgical break – pops his head into Strong’s office: the donated kidney has arrived. We fetch it from the ward and Strong hands him the box with a cheery, “It’s all yours.” He lopes into the lift, heading straight up to theatre. In the office, Strong reclines in her chair and beams. “There you go,” she says. “It’s great, isn’t it?” * * * When we meet, David tells me he hadn’t wanted his wife to donate a kidney. “I just didn’t want her to go through it,” he says. “But she made me realise I had to do it – not just for myself, but for her.” They got together six months after Martha arrived in England from the Colombian city of Bucaramanga to study business in 1985, and married five years later. “Three months down the line, he got ill and the best years of our lives for having a family were gone,” she says. By his last year on dialysis, David was so weak that he was forced to close his successful design and artwork consultancy, aged just 49. “What kind of life is that for the two of us?” Martha had asked of the prospect of her husband going back on dialysis. “I didn’t think that I could cope with more,” she says. When he woke up from surgery last year, David couldn’t believe how well he felt. “I was sending texts, emails,” he says. “I felt great.” He listened to music on the radio a lot in the days that followed and frequently found himself in tears, overwhelmed by the realisation of what Martha, and the kidney exchange scheme, had made possible. “Some people say, ‘You’re unlucky because you’ve been ill so long’,” he says. “I’m lucky. I’m lucky that Martha came into my life and I’m very lucky that I’ve got this kidney. I’ve got a chance for us to go and enjoy ourselves.” This was Ben’s second transplant, too; he suffered kidney failure at the age of 19 and his mother donated directly to him three months later. Early in 2016, the recruitment consultant was told by his doctors at St Helier hospital, in Surrey, that that kidney might only last another six months. He professes not to have minded the two months he spent on dialysis before his first transplant (“I got to watch Come Dine With Me for four hours three times a week and eat really nice sandwiches”) but this time, with a partner, a demanding job and a football team full of teenagers to coach, he was desperate to avoid it. “When we’re together, we’re like two peas in a pod,” Ben says of his father. The night before surgery they went to the pub to watch their beloved Chelsea football club beat Azerbaijan’s Qarabağ FK 6-0 (“He had a pint, I didn’t”). Several months earlier, they were due to be part of another chain, but the operations were cancelled the day before because one of the recipients was unwell. (For the run I looked at with Burnapp, 57 of the 82 transplants that the algorithm came up with – 70% – ended up happening; the figure is increasing and the completion target is 75% by 2020.) The delay was difficult, but Ben was told that Ryan’s kidney – “a big juicy one” – was, in fact, a better match for him. “It’s working wonderfully,” he says. Of everyone in the chain, he’s the least given to dwelling on the emotional side of what he’s been through, though he does remember crying at his first dialysis session, struck by the reality of how ill he was. I spoke to Ben’s dad, Steve, on the phone. Although he lived overseas and ended up travelling back and forth to the UK seven times in a year as a result, he was determined to donate. “He’s my son,” the 55-year-old builder said. “Simple as that. You don’t like to see your kids suffering.” Steve hoped his kidney would give someone a good life but had never really thought about who might end up with it. “As long as Ben got his kidney and he was fine, you could have put it in a pie and cooked it, for all I cared,” he said. But when Ben gets hold of him on a video call at the photoshoot and David tells him how grateful he is, something shifts. “When I started speaking to David it sort of sunk in a bit,” he tells me later. “It was done for Ben, but I have helped someone else have a normal-ish life.” David, meanwhile, is thrilled to discover that his kidney came from a fellow Chelsea fan. He emails Steve that evening, and later shares the message with me: “It is an incredible feeling to think that someone like you has made this incredible gift for a loved one and you have ended up helping not one but two people,” it says. “A million thanks to you.” A few months after their surgery, I catch up with the Ventres. Richard’s kidney is working well and he’s started playing a bit of golf again. Maureen still feels lethargic at times, but she’s enjoying walking and swimming, and hopes to return to yoga soon. They are due to spend their 39th wedding anniversary at the hotel in Torquay where they met, their first trip back since the 70s. And they still hope to travel to some far-flung destinations one day, if the doctors approve. Meanwhile, the members of our six-strong chain plan to keep in touch. Ryan and Ben have been chatting online about their recruitment work; David and Martha want to take Ben and his dad to a Chelsea match next time Steve is in the UK, maybe even get a box. Martha and Lee are meeting for a drink when he’s next in London, and she hopes to arrange a reunion for everyone a year from now. When they met, Lee told the group he’d thought he’d only be interested in meeting Martha, his donor. “But having met everybody it’s strange how it all feels interlinked,” he said. “None of it would have happened if it hadn’t been for everyone.” • For more information, go to organdonation.nhs.uk/about-donation/living-donation Hear Rachel Williams talk about the story behind this article on the new Guardian podcast, Today in Focus, later this month, at theguardian.com.

          "bodyText": "Perhaps Matt Bellamy is the greatest thinker of our age. After all, he’s spent much of Muse’s career warning us about technological conspiracies to take over the world. Yes, we thought he’d been spending too much time on the outer edges of YouTube, but he looks a bit less peculiar in the age of Cambridge Analytica. Which, naturally, is the point at which he chose to trail Muse’s eighth album with the most conventional rock-star gripe of all, on Something Human, a partially acoustic, countryish lope about how hard the life of the touring rock star is: “10,000 miles left on the road / 500 hours until I am home / I need something human.” No, Matt! Bring back the drones and the robots and the alien overlords! You can, however, perhaps see why he felt Muse needed a change. After all, there are probably only so many times you can record wildly overblown songs about your pathological dread of the power structures of a future world without wondering whether it’s a fit pastime for an adult. So Simulation Theory comes trailed as Muse’s synthpop album (it’s not), heavily inspired by the 80s (well, in its cover art; less so in much of the music). New producers are on board, among them Shellback and Timbaland, charged with finding a new face to Muse. Which they do, to a certain extent. Propaganda sounds like Muse are trying to be Prince, which isn’t entirely convincing, while Get Up and Fight bolts on a power ballad chorus to an elegantly restrained verse. But it’s still the less poppy moments that are most exciting: the cascading arpeggios of Blockades, giving way to furious power chords. Or Algorithm, with its none-more-jackbooted synth bass line, urgent strings, and Bellamy emoting about how “algorithms evolve / Push aside / Render us obsolete / This means war.” That’s when you feel yourself seized by an unaccountable desire to march through the streets waving a massive flag, warning your neighbours that the robots are coming to kill us all. Obviously, it would be preferable if robots weren’t coming to kill us all. But for the sake of the gaiety of mankind, let us hope Bellamy retains the nagging suspicion that it really is going to happen. Better that than he carries on telling us life’s lonely on the road, babe."

          "bodyText": "Australia’s vast new facial-matching system would be prone to errors against people of colour, experts have warned. Federal and state governments agreed last year to develop a system known as “the capability”, a powerful database that pools biometric information gleaned from driver’s licences, passports, visas and other sources. The system will be used to identify unknown persons in near real-time and is aimed at helping “to identify suspects or victims of terrorist or other criminal activity, and help to protect Australians from identity crime”. The system has raised significant concern among academics, lawyers, privacy experts and human rights groups, who fear it will encroach on privacy rights, be used for mass general surveillance, and have a “profound chilling effect” on public protest and dissent. Experts have also warned that facial matching is prone to error, particularly against people of colour. Australia’s system is partly based on a model employed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). An investigation of the FBI’s system by the US full house committee on oversight and government last year found it was most prone to error against African Americans. “[Facial recognition technology] has accuracy deficiencies, misidentifying female and African American individuals at a higher rate,” the committee found. “Human verification is often insufficient as a backup and can allow for racial bias.” Monique Mann, a director of the Australian Privacy Foundation and a lecturer at the faculty of law at the Queensland University of Technology, said studies strongly suggested such systems resulted in racial bias. A separate FBI co-authored study found facial recognition was least accurate for African Americans, and a study by Georgetown University, titled the Perpetual Line-up, found that “face recognition may be least accurate for those it is most likely to affect: African Americans”. “Their conclusion is that it’s less accurate in the identification of African-Americans compared to Caucasian individuals, despite police saying their systems are super objective, they don’t see race,” Mann told Guardian Australia. “It gives us this false veil of objectivity of being racially neutral, when in actual fact it’s not.” Prof Liz Campbell of Monash University, an expert on forensic and biometric databases, said the algorithms underpinning facial recognition systems often reflected the biases of the societies in which they were developed. In Britain and Australia, she said, this meant facial recognition was good at identifying white men. “What seems to be the case is the algorithms are good at identifying the people who look like the creators of the algorithm,” she said. “What that means in the British and Australian context is it’s good at identifying white men.” “It’s not that there’s an inherent bias in the algorithm, it’s just the people on who the algorithms are being tested is too narrow.” Accuracy has also been a concern more generally. A pilot study in Wales found facial matching erroneously identified innocent people in 91% of cases. The system requires legislation to be passed at a federal and state level. The federal bill is yet to be passed but some states, including NSW, are pressing ahead with their enabling legislation regardless. NSW Labor has serious concerns about the privacy implications, which they say are not being heeded by government. “Labor is concerned about the privacy implications of ‘the capability’,” the shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, said. “When this was debated in the assembly, I said that Labor was cautious about the proposal and would look carefully at what was done when it was implemented. As I said in the debate, I think this government has been quite disinterested in privacy issues.” NSW Greens MLC David Shoebridge said error rates were likely to be higher for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. He said there was no clear process of appeal for people wrongly identified. “You’re not even told that the facial verification service has been checked,” Shoebridge said. “There’s potentially extraordinarily large impacts upon you if this system gets the facial recognition wrong. “What are we doing handing over our data to a scheme that hasn’t even be finalised?”"

          "bodyText": "Not long ago, Rob Wood found himself at Heston Blumenthal’s house, in south-west London, where he was being persuaded to eat a flower. They were supposed to have been discussing the TV chef’s latest project, testing music’s effects on the dining experience, for which he had hired Wood to pick the songs. Instead, he was recounting a recent trip to south-east Asia. The flowers on his kitchen table, he said, were from that same trip: he was trying to capture their flavour for a dish he was developing. Wood smelled the flowers. Blumenthal, increasingly animated, urged him to take a bite; he wanted the music to capture and complement the flower’s exotic qualities. Under duress, Wood had a little nibble. Wood is the founder and creative director of Music Concierge, a company that chooses background music for businesses. His clients include iconic fashion brands, such as Harvey Nichols and Mulberry, and luxury London hotels, such as the Connaught and the Savoy. Some clients hire Wood because they want to influence individuals’ behaviour. When the football club Tottenham Hotspur was looking for music for its new training ground complex, Wood was asked to provide playlists for a holistic programme covering every aspect of Spurs’ players’ psychological and physical wellbeing. Others seek to create a certain atmosphere, such as the restaurant German Gymnasium, for which he sourced particular bell sounds that evoked Mitteleuropean cafe culture. For another client – a late night, alcohol-free burger bar in Kuwait, which delivers food on a conveyor belt – Wood had to conjure the vibe of a 1980s New York block party, choosing early hip-hop by Grandmaster Flash and lesser-known tracks by James Brown. Music, even when you are barely aware of it, can be surprisingly powerful. Over recent decades, researchers have found that it can affect how much time we think has passed while waiting in a queue, how co-operative shoppers are with sales staff, and even how sweet or bitter food tastes. One study found that shoppers’ preference for French or German wine shifted according to which of the respective countries’ traditional music was playing from a nearby set of speakers. The background music industry – also known as music design, music consultancy or something offered as part of a broader package of “experiential design” or “sensory marketing” – is constantly deciding what we hear as we go about our everyday business. The biggest player in the industry, Mood Media, was founded in 2004 and now supplies music to 560,000 locations across the world, from Sainsbury’s to KFC. The core of a music consultant’s work is creating distinct, cohesive musical identities for brands. That can mean allying the brand with a particular heritage, such as the restaurant Dishoom, where food and interiors pay postmodern homage to colonial-era India, and where Wood’s playlist features a genre known as “exotica”, an American-born, 1950s style, which refracts world music influences through a western lens. At other times, it can be finding a fresh angle, such as Kenyan restaurant group Nyama Mama, which caters to a young, cosmopolitan clientele and where, rather than just global, American-dominated pop, artists from Nairobi are also played. One day this summer, Wood and his team were working on music for a new hotel, the Dixon, which is due to open in a converted courthouse near London’s Tower Bridge in December. Wood’s brief was for distinct playlists for different areas: the lobby, the bar, the restaurant and the gym. Aside from the gym, where the music – sprightly, uplifting club tracks – would remain consistent at all hours, the playlists were to be divided into different “day parts”, the choices tailored to either four or five different time periods. In an office in Shoreditch, the hotel manager and its owners, with the creative agency working on the hotel’s branding, walked Wood and his team through every detail of the project: the build materials, the history, the average sum – £23 – they anticipated customers would spend in the restaurant. They spoke about emphasising the culture of the local area, and showed slides that included phrases such as “where your enrichment begins” and “authenticity in every detail”. (Authenticity is a word that comes up often in these kind of meetings.) The hotel would be marketed as “premium four star”, they explained, designed to appeal to “the discerning executive” and affluent millennials. After the meeting, there was a trip to the half-finished building site, where the owners pointed out architectural features and Wood, who stayed mostly quiet, appeared to be looking for clues. Much of Wood’s job involves taking abstract suggestions – a handful of adjectives, a scattering of reference points, a corporate slogan – and turning them into music. No small amount of intuition is also required. It is common, he says, for clients to speak about being bold or creative. Part of his job is working out what they really want, whether he should deliver something that will precisely match expectations or pleasingly upend them. The following month, Wood showed me the sample playlists his team had come up with. The hotel’s bar was to be in the old courtroom itself, a high-ceilinged room with wooden furniture. The aim with the music there, Wood told me, was to create a sense of loftiness without sounding staid. “They want heritage but they don’t want it to be traditional,” he said, playing me a gentle, swinging jazz track. The way he explained his process often seemed imprecise, but so, too, was the effect he was trying to achieve: a refined sense of the past that could not be pinned down to any specific period. * * * For most people, background music means muzak. In the 1920s, George Owen Squier, a former US army officer who went on to earn a doctorate in electrical engineering, developed a new way to transmit audio through wires. His idea led to the creation of a company named Wired Music, which enabled businesses to broadcast music in offices and commercial premises. In 1934, in homage to the wildly successful camera company Kodak, Wired Radio was renamed Muzak. In its early days, Muzak sold itself on the basis that it could make workplaces more productive. Its programme for offices and factories was structured around “Stimulus Progression”, a system invented in the 1940s, where instrumental classical recordings were played in 15-minute sequences, alternated with silence, the music gradually increasing in intensity. In 1956, a report commissioned by Muzak claimed, somewhat implausibly, that its programme had produced an 18.6% increase in production and a 37% decrease in the number of errors made by office employees at the Mississippi Power &amp; Light Company, whose job was to enter meter readings into the company’s billing system. Sonically, muzak set the template for background music that would persist for decades: orchestral instrumentals which referenced classical and, later, popular music. Over time, the name would become a term of derision, synonymous with a kind of dated easy-listening music infuriatingly drifting through every public space. “It’s just a kind of amniotic fluid that surrounds us,” said communications professor Gary Gumpert in a 1990 documentary. “It never startles us, it is never too loud, it is never too silent; it’s always there.” It was a balm to sooth awkward silences, gentle encouragement toward a brightened mood. An indication of the popularity it once enjoyed is the radio stations – with names like Easy Listening and Beautiful Music – which brought the format into people’s homes. Although the background music industry has existed for almost a century, it has constantly been reshaped by changes in the way music is distributed. For decades, the industry’s ability to deliver music in a non-stop format was as important to clients as the music itself. Each of the background music companies developed its own technology for distributing the music supplied to businesses. For Muzak, it was the transmission through wires it had patented decades earlier; for fellow US-based company 3M, it was a bulky cartridge format, sent through the post and then played through a device also of its own design. In the 1970s, the introduction of affordable multi-deck tape players – compared to the fiddly steps involved in putting on a vinyl record, or unreliable multi-record changers – suddenly made it easy for businesses to choose and play music continuously. “You couldn’t control the market any longer,” recalled Peter Standley, who worked at a major UK background music company, Reditune, during that period. Technology also helped shift the consensus about what background music could be. With cassette players at home and in cars, people became accustomed to listening to whatever they wanted, wherever they were. As early as the late 1960s, companies such as Yesco in the US had started licensing original music from record labels, using the popular songs of the moment, rather than easy listening arrangements which paid reference to them. Over time, this became the norm, including at Muzak, which eventually merged with Yesco. (More recently, Muzak was acquired by Mood Media, and in 2013, its brand name was retired.) By the time the CD was invented, in 1982, background music was becoming more nuanced. The CD was the first digital format for music and, by the late 1990s, it had enabled background music companies to develop digital libraries – before the likes of iTunes in the early 2000s – where tracks could be organised by highly specific filters. “If you wanted nothing but love songs that were slow tempo, sung by women, that had a saxophone solo, we could create a playlist using our database,” said Sean Horton, a former music consultant for PlayNetwork. But that was just a taste of the new world of infinite choice that was to come. * * * There are two main ways psychologists think about the effects that music can have on us. The first is physical. Numerous studies have confirmed our common sense assumption that we often subconsciously match what we are doing to what we hear. In 1985, for instance, one study found that diners chewed at a faster pace when higher-tempo music was played. (Researchers measured this according to the delightfully named metric, bites-per-minute.) Interestingly, they noted, diners did not finish their meals faster, suggesting that they had actually been taking smaller bites. The second approach focuses on the associations that music can trigger and how context, such as the environment we are in, affects those associations. One 1998 study found that diners in a cafeteria were willing to spend more money when classical music was played in the background than when there was no music at all. One explanation, researchers suggested, was that diners associated classical music with quality. (In an indictment of the changed fortunes of easy listening music, it elicited a worse response from diners than silence.) Researchers also use the related concept of “musical fit” to understand why people respond to particular music differently depending on the setting. Wood and his team need to take both of these approaches into account. When the client is a retailer, three words come up time and again: high dwell time. Clients want to keep customers browsing for as long as possible. For one high-end department store, Wood’s job was to calm down a busy, hectic environment. Deploying delicate contemporary classical and “intimate vocals”, he aimed to make the store a more pleasant place to spend time, while also complementing the upmarket feel of the building. Some jobs require the opposite approach, however. Many hotels do not have capacity to seat all of their guests for breakfast, which means they want to turn tables quickly. In those cases, Wood provides a brisk soundtrack, rather than the more sedate, leisurely sounds you might expect. One question all music consultants face is just how unobtrusive their selections should be. It is a choice that is sometimes described as between “foreground” or “background” music. Andreas Liffgarden, of Spotify-backed background music supplier Soundtrack Your Brand, drew an analogy between the foreground approach and the way certain fashion labels refuse to pander to their clientele’s tastes. “You might not like red trousers,” he said, “but I don’t give a fuck about that, because red trousers is in vogue in 2018, right?” For better or worse, most clients are not looking for the musical equivalent of red trousers. Paul Hillyer, head of media at Mood Media’s UK business, described the approach his company often takes as “cradle to grave”, the least offensive to the widest spectrum of people. One of their clients is Fuller’s Brewery, which plays music in most of its 400 or so pubs in the UK. Andrew Durn, whose role at Fuller’s involves liaising with Mood Media, described its sound as being roughly like Radio 2, catering to an older, comfortable crowd. “What we don’t want,” he told me, “is customers walking in, listening to the music and saying: ‘What’s that all about?’” It is the strenuously inoffensive nature of this kind of background music that riles up some of the industry’s fiercest critics. One group, Pipedown, have campaigned “for freedom from unwanted music in public places” since 1992, when its founder, Nigel Rodgers, was spurred to action by a particularly irritating experience in a South Kensington restaurant. “Do you hate unwanted piped background music?” reads the call to arms on the group’s website. “Do you detest the way you can’t escape it? (in pubs, restaurants and hotels; on the plane, train or bus; down the phone; ruining decent television programmes; adding to the overall levels of noise pollution in public places).” The group, which counts Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley among its celebrity supporters, claims some credit for the decision Marks &amp; Spencer took in 2016 to stop using music in its stores. “You’re not going for a special sort of atmosphere, you’re just going to do your shopping,” Rodgers said. One of Pipedown’s boldest claims is that there is “no genuine evidence” that background music increases sales. Opinions vary on this question, although most experts do not share Pipedown’s hardline position. Adrian North, a psychology professor at Curtin University in Perth, argues that small purchases are where it is most possible to influence consumers. He conducted the 1997 study that found that shoppers were more likely to choose either French or German wine, depending on which of the respective countries’ music they heard, something he contrasted with a decision like buying a car. “I would be astonished,” he said, “if someone chose a Renault over a Volkswagen just because you play French music in a showroom.” Others argue that it makes more sense to think about the influence of background music in terms of subtle, long-term benefits, rather than immediate impact on sales. Rhonda Hadi, marketing professor at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, believes companies that provide an experience, such as flights or accommodation, can reap the greatest rewards. “The service itself is so intangible,” she said, “that people rely on any cues they can to gauge the quality of the service that they’ve received.” Hadi says that consumers value this holistic approach more than they used to. Younger consumers, she said, tend to value authenticity, which the marketing industry interprets as a preference for “congruence”, the idea that everything should fit with the brand and the story they tell about themselves. While it might not alter someone’s decision about which car to buy, the right music, in a particular car showroom, might coalesce with a package of other details to make someone feel good about the hefty sum of money they are about to part with. * * * One afternoon in July, two Music Concierge staff – music consultant Damon Martin and account manager Morgan Mackintosh – visited Mulberry’s Kensington office. They were there to present a sample set of playlists for the redesign of the British brand’s flagship Regent Street store. Around the table were Baron Osuna, Mulberry’s head of image, and Bradley Taylor, head of visual merchandising and store design. Mackintosh turned her laptop around to display a PowerPoint presentation, which she clicked through as Martin talked. Music Concierge’s brief had been to find music that would match the concept for the store’s new design, “British Brutalism”, as well as Mulberry’s “brand pillars”: Britishness; quality; lifestyle; accessibility; real. The plans for the store involved concrete structures planted in the centre of the shop, along with glazed green tiles and Windsor chairs. Phrases used to describe the new design included “British nature”, “decorative gestures”, and “honest materials”. One of the steers from Mulberry was that it wanted the stores to feel more like a gallery space. In the past, Mulberry had signalled “Britishness” in its stores by playing artists such as the Cure and Joy Division, but for this new design, Martin suggested slightly more avant-garde British artists, such as Brian Eno and Four Tet. (Speaking in a nearby cafe afterwards, Martin recalled different versions of “Britishness” he had come up with for other clients, like Noël Coward for a heritage hotel, or young guitar bands for a high street retailer.) A song by Digitonal, downbeat and electronic, played tinnily from Martin’s portable speakers. “It’s on the softer side,” he said, “but it has a sense of drama and it builds.” Taylor and Osuna listened, nodded, and offered occasional comments. “It might feel a bit sombre,” Osuna said. “I think we could approach the warmth through playfulness,” replied Martin, picking out a song by Russian artist Kate NV. Ascribing it to “real”, the final brand pillar, he said, “There’s a sort of eccentricity to it that offers a sense of lightness.” The songs presented to Mulberry were intended to convey how the full playlists would sound. Once a client is satisfied with Music Concierge’s concept, the team at the office adds flesh to the bones: the playlist designers, who are junior to the music consultants, search through their internal music libraries to find songs that will make up the playlists’ full length, which can number between 1,000 and 8,000. The number mostly depends on how many different sections the client wants to divide their playlist into, and the number of different areas at the location. The cost, per site, can range from about £35 to £250 a month. Companies like Music Concierge have capitalised on the sweeping changes to the world of retail in recent years. In the face of competition from online retailers, many high-street businesses have sought to repackage shops as a “destination”: no longer just a functional place to buy things, they are presented as an experience. The idea of experiential marketing has also taken hold. The business academics Bernd Schmitt and Alex Simonson captured this idea in a prescient book published in 1997: “In a world in which most consumers have their basic needs satisfied,” they wrote, “value is easily provided by satisfying customers’ experiential needs – their aesthetic needs.” Martin Lindstrom’s influential 2005 book, Brand Sense, built upon these ideas, hailing the marketing power of sound and scent. He cited Play-Doh, Crayola and Johnson’s Baby Powder as the brands with the most recognisable smells. Underscoring music’s role in conjuring positive associations, he wrote: “Music makes new memories, evokes the past, and instantaneously can transport you to another place.” Music Concierge was one of several companies set up in the mid-to-late 2000s, responding to these trends, and in particular a greater commercial appetite for music carefully tailored to particular brands. Rob Wood, like many of these companies’ founders and employees, had jumped ship from the music and media industries. His trajectory is something of a parable for the way the music industry has had to transform itself – both economically and culturally – in response to the changes wrought by technology. After graduating from university in the early 1990s, Wood spent a few years DJing and running an arts listings magazine, eventually going on to become editor of the alternative music magazine Jockey Slut in 1999. But, as the internet began to eat away at the magazine industry’s circulation figures and advertising revenues, Wood ended up working for an online booking portal for luxury hotels. Reviewing hotels for them, he noticed how often establishments would be playing music that seemed jarring. “They were just putting on what I’d call Cafe del Bula Bar,” he told me. “Cliched music, which wasn’t appropriate to a boutique hotel in the Cotswolds.” At just the time that the digital revolution was shaking up the music and media industries, businesses were increasingly seeking the skillset that Wood possessed. After a few years of ad-hoc consultancy, in 2007 he founded Music Concierge. Wood is sanguine about his role in pulling music away from the alternative enclaves where he first discovered it. As the music business has tanked, for many the notion of “selling out” has come to seem dated. Selling rights for songs to be used in adverts, TV, videogames, films and public spaces now accounts for a much greater slice of music industry profits. Any artist still reticent about licensing their music may be persuaded to do so by the promise that it will be used in a more sophisticated, artful way than ever before – a change Wood has played a part in: his job, after all, is scuffing the line between commerce and culture. “I’m doing something I’ve always done,” he said. “I’ve always been driven by introducing people to music they didn’t know they might love.” Just as it always has, the future of Wood’s industry will depend on how well it can adapt to the pace of change. Since Spotify was founded in 2008, digital sales of music have collapsed, and streaming – on Spotify and its competitors Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Pandora and more – has become the way most people listen to music. Everyone can now instantly access most of the world’s recorded music online. For background music companies, streaming is both a threat and an opportunity. On the one hand, music has become easier to access and distribute, meaning that companies like Music Concierge can select, deliver and tweak the music they deliver to businesses with greater speed, flexibility and precision than ever before. On the other hand, everyone now has access to vast music libraries that were once the preserve of a tiny number of hardcore music nerds and people working in the industry. “It went from us being the boutique music expert to having more of a collaboration with the brand,” said Sean Horton, who worked as a music consultant at PlayNetwork for over a decade. “Streaming turned everyone into a music expert.” Behind the rise of streaming lurks the spectre of automation. One part of Spotify’s appeal is its playlists, where it offers music for particular activities, as well as individualised recommendations. The latter relies on comparing your choices with those of millions of other users, combined with analyses of the raw properties of songs, such as key, mode and tempo. For many people I spoke to while reporting this piece, the algorithms used to provide these recommendations seemed to be a source of anxiety. At the bigger companies, in particular, staff were keen to stress the importance of the real-life curator. Richard Hampson at Imagesound emphasised the intuitive side to his job. “It’s always been about feel and human touch,” he argued. “Human taste is really important, and the algorithm thing is removing that.” During my visit to his office in July, Wood showed me a playlist he was working on for Gravetye Manor, a hotel we had visited the previous month. Compared to many of his other projects, this one was a minor undertaking: it was for a bar that seats about 20 people. The hotel had just sent some feedback that the music for the evening sounded a little too muted, and he had some ideas for livening it up. He clicked through his laptop, pondering each of the songs’ qualities, teasing out how they might fit together. “A bit of Britishness,” he said, enthusiastically, picking a track by Richard Hawley; as well as a Marvin Gaye track, “to balance it out with a bit of familiarity”. A Shirley Bassey cover of the Doors, her voice crooning out of the laptop speakers was, he explained, “a way of testing the boundary”. He paused to listen for a moment, pleased with the choice. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "bodyText": "A massive star in Asia, actor, model and singer Kris Wu first found fame with Chinese-Korean boyband Exo, who were so phenomenally popular they once sold out an arena concert in 1.47 seconds. He left because “they feed you music and you just kinda do it, you don’t have freedom”, and is now releasing his solo debut, which has all the hallmarks of an artist who is still creatively shackled, whether by a language barrier or a lack of original artistry. Wu has turned away from the selection-box pop of Exo and honed in on a US rap sound, aping the warbling, microdosed delivery of Travis Scott (who guests on Deserve), the triplet time of Quavo, and the croon of Drake in soft-boy mode. There’s nothing theoretically wrong with these simulacra – Wu shouldn’t feel obliged to bring in tangibly Asian sonics to differentiate his work – but his blank boyband voice simply isn’t as characterful as those he’s aping. His mostly English lyrics are hip-hop Huel, a beige stock of cliches and signifiers that becomes embarrassing: the clean-cut Wu is audibly not a “savage”, and his complaint of “suicide when I can’t see my shorty” is crass and stupid. There is a sing-song catchiness to the melody of that line on November Rain, and a feathery lightness to Wu’s delivery on Explore, but the blankness of the lyrics makes it all feel pointless. Producers such as the usually brilliant Murda Beatz, meanwhile, turn in thin work that has clearly been knocking around subfolders for some time. This algorithmic rap karaoke is a misjudged use of Wu’s pop smarts."

          "headline": "The Vampire: A New History by Nick Groom review – an undead family tree",
          "bodyText": "Nick Groom concludes this invigorating study of vampires by suggesting that we should try to be a bit more like them. Thankfully this doesn’t entail hanging shiftily around blood donor banks or having your cuspids filed to a point (that’s a thing apparently – although heaven knows where you’d find a dentist who’d oblige). Rather, Groom wants us to think about vampires as a way of re-enchanting the contemporary human condition. Before we can do that, though, we need to know what we’re dealing with. Groom’s pet peeve is the way recent scholarly work has wrenched the figure of the vampire from its political and social origins and turned it into an ahistorical archetype on which to dump any passing concerns. For instance, much has been written about how the vampire came to prominence at the end of the 19th century, courtesy of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, as a way of articulating fears about the British empire fighting, or biting, back. But the stubborn fact remains that Stoker’s count comes from Transylvania, a European locale not so far from home. It was more likely that the pale, etiolated Wallachian nobleman resonated with contemporary readers as the avatar of an ailing British aristocracy that was finding it increasingly tricky to keep itself buoyant during an agricultural depression (Dracula does travel with 50 boxes of his native soil, after all). In other words, Groom wants to construct a rigorous genealogy of the vampire and, to this end, picks the early 18th century as his place to start. Before this there had been myriad tall tales about bloodsucking creatures popping up all over “the Levant”. In Serbia you could spot the undead by their ruddy complexions as a result of all that snacking on friends and family, while in Slavonic folklore a male vampire would make a point of returning for a conjugal visit, to be followed, nine months later, by the arrival of a baby without a skeleton. On Mykonos there was a creature called the Vrykolakas, who rose from the dead and ran around aggressively until stopped by some brave islander reaching into the decaying corpse and tearing out its heart. What turned this motley crew of stinking, sexed-up roustabouts into vampires, Groom contends, is their run-in with Enlightenment thought. From the early 18th century the doctors, scientists and theologians of western Europe started not only to collect and codify these bloodthirsty folktales but also to try to come up with rational explanations. Perhaps the peasants had simply been drinking too much hoppy beer and imagined the whole thing. Or maybe they were so flummoxed by the shifting borders of the decaying Habsburg empire that this was their way of expressing panic about outsiders. The Protestants of northern Europe, meanwhile, thought it all nonsense peddled by the Orthodox Church. The upshot of this cultural encounter was that vampires – both the possibility and the impossibility of them – became what Groom calls “the stuff of thought”, implicated in every aspect of medical, technological and even theological life. Inoculation against smallpox now became a source of terror: someone knew someone who knew a boy from Peckham who had received the usual prophylactic dose of cowpox and started chewing the cud. Grafting teeth from the dead to the living – a rudimentary form of dental implant dating from the days of Henry VIII – was now a perilous activity, in the course of which you were likely to end up with venereal disease from your donor. Even the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches found the vampire provided food for thought thanks to the way it echoed the rite of holy communion, during which the congregation lined up to drink Christ’s blood. This insistence on the historical specificity of vampires is carried through to Groom’s account of Dracula, in which he shows that while Stoker’s classic of 1897 plays off gothic tropes from earlier in the century, it is also strenuously up-to-date. The text is stuffed with such commodified brand names as Kodak cameras and Winchester rifles. Mina Murray is a dab hand at typing and shorthand, while her fiance Jonathan Harker spends the first two pages of the novel pondering train timetables and eastern European racial migration. It is no accident, Groom maintains, that Dracula chooses this moment of hypermateriality in which to make his big entrance: it is his job to connect rational, industrial Britain with older mysteries. This is also why, a century later, vampires again took over the world in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and True Blood, and the Twilight book and film franchise. At exactly the moment when human life was becoming circumscribed by the digital datasphere, vampires were a reminder that some aspects of experience are simply too slippery and strange to be captured in an algorithm. And it is to keep us open to that numinous unreality, Groom says, that we should continue to invite vampires across the threshold and into our imaginative lives. • The Vampire: A New History is published by Yale.

Up close, however, the paintwork becomes a grid of mechanical-looking dots, the man’s face a golden blur with black holes for eyes. Look into those eyes. They show no sign of feeling or life. Did a computer make this? The answer is yes. The first artwork generated by AI to be sold at Christie’s, its impressive price would seem to suggest that in future we will get computers to make art for us. Robot van Gogh will harmlessly cut its ear off and robot Picasso will be a genius, minus the misogyny. Is this the future AI art visionaries such as the French collective Obvious, which programmed this “painter” by getting it to compare its own work with 15,000 pre-20th century portraits, have in mind? Or are they just, God forbid, making a fast buck from gullible art collectors? Because believing the algorithm that knocked this up to be in any meaningful way an “artist” is like thinking your voice-interaction programme is out to get you. Dream on. Computers would need to replicate human consciousness before they could replicate the funny thing humans do called “art”. Art is a way in which human consciousness expresses itself, and is equally true of the earliest cave art, Rembrandt’s portraits and Duchamp’s urinal. And that is what is missing from Portrait of Edmond Bellamy. Art is a way humans communicate ideas, perceptions and feelings to each other. It has no existence outside the human passion to communicate. So in what meaningful sense can an AI replica of certain physical traits of old master paintings be called art? For a robot to really make art, it would need an autonomous mind that was emotional as well as rational. No AI developer has yet claimed to be anywhere near achieving that and if they ever do, their creation will probably have better things to do than paint portraits – like destroy humanity. Maybe afterwards robots will invent their own kind of art, but it won’t be some poor pastiche of human genius. It will be beyond anything we organics could imagine."

          "bodyText": "Cynical but essentially harmless? Or another instance of unacknowledged racism? Claims that Netflix’s algorithm has presented some users with “racially targeted” promotional images for films and TV shows has caused consternation among some – and shrugs from others. Does it matter if a tech company uses data to tailor a user’s experience? Isn’t it a handy corrective to the entertainment industry’s inherent bias? Netflix has said there isn’t a case to answer, insisting that it doesn’t “ask members for their race, gender or ethnicity”, so therefore it can’t use that data to personalise its service. “The only information we use is a member’s viewing history,” it added. But the fact remains that a user who enjoys watching Spike Lee or Ava Duvernay films are more likely to be shown ads using black and brown actors to promote a film or TV show, regardless of their prominence in the production. The truth is that Netflix has created an intrusive, blunt, and at best, clumsy tool. It’s OK for a streaming service to use your previous history to suggest shows or films you may like. Personally, I find that Netflix suggestions are usually in the right ballpark. But unthinkingly shoving a black or brown face in advertising materials is misguided in a number of ways. First, viewers are being lured into watching something on a false premise. As much as I might want Chiwetel Ejiofor to be the lead in Love Actually, he isn’t. He’s a minor part of an ensemble. Martine McCutcheon has a bigger part than him. As a viewer I’d be pretty annoyed to find out either of those facts after investing more than two hours. Second, and more importantly, it gives a false idea of diversity in Hollywood, suggesting a never-ending stream of films and TV shows with black and brown leads. That’s not how it is. The film industry has often used the same tactics for different ends when advertising films with large black casts outside of the US. The most egregious example of this in recent years was the 12 Years a Slave campaign in Italy. The studio decided to advertise Steve McQueen’s Oscar-winning film about the real-life story of Solomon Northup’s kidnapping and enslavement by using an image of Brad Pitt, who is barely on screen but just happens to be the most well-known white actor in the film. The curious thing is Netflix does have a growing collection of films starring people of colour. Bright, Nappily Ever After, The Incredible Jessica James, Burning Sands, Step Sisters and Mudbound are all projects that have benefited from Netflix investing in black talent. It would have been great for Netflix to curate a month of great films starring or directed by people of colour for Black History Month. That would have been a progressive and daring move. Instead, we got the news that one of its biggest black-led shows, Luke Cage, was being cancelled – and now we discover that Netflix uses a crude tool to “serve” its customers. It says a lot about the way people of colour are seen by some companies: homogeneous, simple and easily pleased, rather than the complex, demanding and cultured consumers that we are. “Netflix doesn’t know you,” wrote Stuart Heritage in 2015 when the idea of an all-knowing algorithm was still relatively new. “Netflix is an automated system governed by a crude algorithm. It doesn’t know that you like long, contemplative walks in the park. It doesn’t know that you regularly donate to charity. It can’t see into your soul.” It’s true, it really can’t. And it needs to change if it’s to truly serve its diverse customers. • Lanre Bakare is the Guardian’s TV editor"

          "headline": "Träkol, Gateshead: ‘Outrageously good’ – restaurant review",
          "bodyText": "Hillgate Quays, Gateshead NE8 2BH (0191 737 1120). Small plates £3-£8.50, mains £11-£8.50, feasting £40-£70, wines from £15 About an hour into our dinner at Träkol, one of my companions sits back. He surveys the outrageous platters on the table and says: “I think this may be my new favourite restaurant in the whole country.” It’s a big bold statement, but it’s one I can get behind. Träkol, located in a nest of renovated shipping containers tucked under the Tyne Bridge on the Gateshead side, is not some colonically irrigated, Botoxed and depilated gastro palace. It’s not going to wrench you through the torture garden of faine daining. It’s something so very much better than that: a ragingly modern restaurant determined to feed you with the seriously good stuff, until you slump back and say, enough already. Google Translate tells me that träkol is the Swedish for charcoal; if it’s wrong, go argue with the algorithm. Certainly, it makes sense. The kitchen, located behind a glass wall to keep from smoke-curing its diners, is dominated by a huge charcoal grill. So yes, another live fire restaurant, but one with serious intent. It is the food end of a smart operation collectively called the By the River Brew Company, run by Dave Stone and Rob Cameron of Wylam, a 30-barrel microbrewery in Newcastle’s Exhibition Park. There’s also a cycle repair unit out back and at weekends, a market down the banks of the Tyne for street food operators. Shortly, more converted containers will come into use for restaurant pop-ups. Both the website and the menu vibrate with buzz words: not just “live fire” but “fiercely seasonal” and “nose to tail”. Meat is dry-aged in a room lined with salt that comes from the Himalayas. Well, obviously. For once it all amounts to something. Take a dish like the grilled pork jowl with XO slaw from the small plates list. At first it looks like the pungent coleslaw, rendered a shade of amber from its Asian dressing, has been laid on toast, until you cut in. Now you clock that the burnished slabs underneath are pieces of crisped, salty pig cheek that have been slow-cooked then seared. It’s one of those dishes that you think about when you wake up the next day. From the same list, tomatoes are salt-baked to intensify their flavour, cooled then layered with slices of pink lamb heart. Those turn up on toast, sodden with sweet tomato juices and salted anchovy. There are thumbnail-sized surf clams, opened over fire before being pelted with fermented black beans and red chilli. You suck the sweet, salty clam meat off the shell and then keep probing with your tongue for all the other good stuff tucked away in there. Happily, they can also do delicate, allowing Lindisfarne oysters to sing under a bright Nam Jim dressing of lime, fish sauce and chilli. Or you can have them baked under Montgomery’s cheddar. It’s a tricky thing to pull off. Montgomery’s is a bruiser of a cheese. It could easily overwhelm the oyster, especially if you let it spend too long under the grill. They don’t. The sea and the dairy hold hands. But the real fun lies under the heading “Feasting”. Take Middle White Pig. You get two platters. On the first is a 1kg chop, charred outside, slightly pink within, with thick discs of black pudding, its exterior crisped. There are caramelised apples, a watercress salad and grilled potatoes. The other platter brings half a pig’s head. (If you don’t like to be reminded that meat comes from animals with ears and noses, move on to the next paragraph.) The skin is crackled to within an inch of its life; oh how I love the sound a pig ear makes when it snaps. The meat underneath is soft and sweet. And the price for all this? £40. Allegedly it’s for two and I’m sure the management don’t want me to argue, because they need the orders. But I’d be quite afraid of the two people who could finish this by themselves. Bring a friend. Let them hang around for the whole grilled turbot. It takes serious skill and nerve to grill a beautiful fish like this and get it right. The skin is grilled to that curious place between gelatinous and crisp. The pearly fillet underneath slides off the bone with a nudge. It is fish cookery of the first order – and a lot of it for £55, which is £10 less than at Brat in London. It comes with new potatoes, and peas braised with bacon. (They will do you a single serving of turbot for £20.) There are six of us booked in to eat tonight: most of the panellists and producers of Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. We are probably the crew of terrible people you most don’t want to see turn up in your lovely restaurant without due warning. If so, they do not flinch. Tables are pushed together to make room. Advice is given for those who want it on the long list of beers, with names like Weizen My Ass, Tangerine Tart and Broken Dream. Almost all of them are offered in small and large measures. There’s also an encouraging wine list including a 2017 Albariño from Rías Baixas for an extremely good value £26. In London it’s usually £40+. Because there are six of us, and the two feasting dishes are meant for four, we also get a cauliflower steak seared on the grill and enthusiastically seasoned with shawarma spices, plus a thick cut Barnsley chop with cockles, seaweed butter and samphire. This is called over-ordering, but how were we to know? There are desserts, but there isn’t even a discussion around our table. We are done. For the record, the desserts on offer are a plate of wood-fired figs with caramelised brioche, or a sundae of salted caramel, chocolate and peanuts. If you make it to those, I’ll be impressed. The nearest thing to a quibble is over their Reuben sandwich fritters, which are tasty enough, but don’t hit us with the flavours of sauerkraut, Russian dressing or Swiss cheese. Look. I’m working hard to find a niggle. But by now you should have got the message: Träkol is a place you want to eat in. Just go with enough people to do it justice. News bites I’ve already referenced Brat in east London, on account of their way with turbot, but Tomos Parry’s live fire cooking goes far beyond that star dish, to take in the likes of Herdwick mutton, whole mallard and serious pieces of beef. Do not miss his chopped egg salad with the salty hit of bottarga, or his game sausage with blood pudding and beans, a rustic dish in high heels (bratrestaurant.com). The soup company Yorkshire Provender has launched a product designed to raise money for the homelessness charity Centrepoint, based on a competition winning entry by home cook Omero Gallucci. 20p from each pot of the red pepper and chorizo soup, available in Waitrose, will go to the charity as part of their ‘Big Broth’ fundraising campaign. Crowdfunder of the week: brothers Liam and Ellis Barrie, of the Marram Grass restaurant in Anglesey, north Wales are looking to raise £30,000 to open a cookery school, providing lessons not just for paying guests but also local school children.

          "headline": "Film fans see red over Netflix  ‘targeted’ posters for black viewers",
          "bodyText": "For anyone familiar with spending an unrelaxing hour scrolling through the Netflix menu trying to work out what to watch, the idea that one of the world’s biggest media companies would personalise your viewing choices might be welcome. Binged through Making a Murderer? Try The Staircase. Enjoyed Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? Make your way through The Good Place. So far, so algorithmic. But now the streaming giant stands accused of being “creepy”, “racist” and “insidious” by black users fed up with Netflix’s advertising of films and shows that they claim is targeting them by ethnicity. Take the Richard Curtis ensemble romcom Love Actually, which stars Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth in the leading roles. Some Netflix users are seeing the image used to advertise the film reconfigured to look like it is primarily a love story between the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor – who plays a less prominent part – and Keira Knightley. Similarly, the murder mystery series The Good Cop was shown with its minor black characters front and centre for some, but with its principal white cast for others. On Twitter, Stacia L Brown, a writer and creator of the podcast Hope Chest, asked: “Other Black @netflix users: does your queue do this? Generate posters with the Black cast members on them to try to compel you to watch? This film stars Kristen Bell/Kelsey Grammer and these actors had maaaaaybe a 10 cumulative minutes of screen time. 20 lines between them, tops.” Underneath she posted Netflix’s promotional artwork for the film Like Father, specifically presented to her with the black actors Leonard Ouzts and Blaire Brooks. “This feels like a step too far,” said Tobi Aremu, 26, a film-maker from Brooklyn. Recently he watched the film Set It Up, “which was made to look like a two-hander between Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu, but they were secondary characters in the love story of a young white couple!” To him, the misrepresentation of Netflix’s actual offer felt problematic. “It’s beyond feeling duped,” he said. “Because if something is black, I take no offence in being catered to. I am black, give me black entertainment, give me more – but don’t take something that isn’t and try to present like it is. I wonder what the makers of those shows and films think. If it was me, I would be very upset.” Londoner Tolani Shoneye, a host on The Receipts Podcast, said: “It’s intrusive. It’s the dark side of marketing. I noticed it a while ago with a Zac Efron film that I’d already seen, but Netflix kept showing me it as a Michael B Jordan movie.” She thought it was odd at first but then assumed that everyone must be shown the same posters. To her, Netflix’s ambition to satisfy its diverse membership is failing to match up to its content. “There was 30 minutes of a romcom I ended up watching last week because I thought it was about the black couple I was shown on the poster. I want to see those stories. They know I want to see those stories. Why don’t they just make more of them?” Last December, Netflix rolled out a new algorithm to begin serving up personalised images to its now 137 million subscriber-base. “Artwork personalisation” became a priority after the company’s own research proved that it was the biggest influencing factor on a viewer deciding what to watch, constituting 82% of their focus. Multiple images are now generated for each and every title and change regularly to lure audiences depending on their tastes and previous viewing history. In a company blogpost explaining the technology, Netflix showed how the 1997 Oscar-winner Good Will Hunting would be presented to different users: for heavy romcom watchers, the poster would show Matt Damon and Minnie Driver kissing. For comedy fans, it would be a solo image of Robin Williams. There was no mention that if you watched the Wayans brothers oeuvre or Dear White People, your homepage would convince you that The Crown is a more diverse show than it is. “Netflix’s recommendation engine is second to none, and works almost seamlessly in the background,” said Tim Harrington, a senior broadcast research analyst. “But the algorithm for targeted artwork is shown as downright clunky when, say, [some] users are offered artwork for ITV’s Lewis with black actors despite both leads and almost the entire cast being white. Netflix knows a lot about you, perhaps even race, but their understanding of what to do with this information is currently rudimentary.” Netflix said: “We don’t ask members for their race, gender or ethnicity so we cannot use this information to personalise their individual Netflix experience. The only information we use is a member’s viewing history.” On Twitter, the debate continued to perplex, amuse and anger. “I bet people at the company thought it would be a cool idea and drive engagement,” wrote the Chicagoan coder @bensayingthat. “But people generally don’t like knowing they’re being treated differently because of their race – especially not in the comfort of their own homes trying to watch a movie.”"

          "headline": "Get the London look? Been So Long is a Michaela Coel musical in the midst of an identity crisis",
          "bodyText": "One of the hardest places to set a scene is modern-day Britain, and the shows that get it right do so because of carefully observed atmospheric details. In Utopia, the violence seemed more horrifying because it was laid against the New Labour neons of academy schools and motorway service stations. Top Boy’s version of London gang life felt authentic because of the small inflections: the 80s-style shopping cities; the hydroponic glare of every scene. Been So Long (from Friday 26 October, Netflix) is a musical set in contemporary Camden, north London, with songs propping up a story about single parenthood, gentrification, knife crime and drug arrests – a kind of Annie Ket Your Gums, if you will. The big draw is Michaela Coel, who plays a mother who puts her daughter ahead of her own love life until she’s dragged on a night out and meets Raymond (Arinzé Kene), who has just been released from prison. Coel doesn’t just carry so much as benchpress every scene she’s in. But the realness of her performance, especially her raw, gasped singing, makes everything else feel phony by comparison; particularly a plot about Gil, a crazed blade-wielding teen who seems set on killing Raymond for no reason whatsoever. I can only assume he got lost in Netflix’s algorithm and was meant to be in another show entirely. A lot of it is filmed in Camden Town, but many scenes feel oddly generic. It opens with a song-and-dance in a market full of fabrics and fruit stalls, but there’s nowhere in 2018’s Camden that feels like that: it’s all street food and vintage boutiques. The songs, apparently “influenced by the backdrop of London’s historic music scene, from Caribbean soca … to acid house”, are so watered down they may as well be homeopathic. Even when the show tries to address the changing nature of London it feels like a fraud: the community pub that’s being closed down looks like a generic sitcom bar; and the crucial date scene, which is loudly prefaced by the line “Do you want to get some ungentrified food?”, is filmed in a famous Iranian restaurant in Peckham, on the other side of the city. It’s strange, because Che Walker, who wrote the screenplay, has lived in Camden his whole life. He’s adapted the film from his stage musical but, perhaps in a bid to be faithful to the original, has created something unfit for screens. The story lurches through every formulaic plot point going (the sudden appearance of an absentee father at the school gates; the spurned lover being caught with another woman just as he was about to get a second chance) but gives no personality or backstory to anyone but the two leads. It’s less like a film, more like the Children in Need musical episode of a soap you’ve never seen before. Of course, musicals don’t have to be realistic. No one gives Grease a hard time for it’s non-representative portrayal of high schools. But Been So Long is neither fantastical enough to be magical nor well-observed enough to be real. Some scenes feel so childish they could be on CBeebies; others are explicit sexual come-hithers. This inability to retain its identity means a film that tries to make Camden the star ends up belonging nowhere."

          "bodyText": "UniLad has been bought by its arch-rival internet company LadBible following a takeover process that laid bare the financial challenges facing online publishers. The two British companies – who were competitors but have an entangled history – are the two biggest publishers on Facebook, thanks to their combination of viral videos and understanding of how to game the social network’s algorithm. This makes them bigger outfits on the social network than the likes of the BBC, CNN and New York Times. But despite their enormous scale, the latest company accounts suggest the combined annual revenue of both UniLad and LadBible is about £25m, a fraction of the income that traditional media used to enjoy. UniLad employs more than 200 staff, many of whom are young graduates based in its Manchester editorial office who had feared their company could be mothballed by LadBible. However, they have been told that they will be kept as a separate business in the wider group with no immediate job losses. “There will be an assessment period where they talk to all of us and come up with a business plan,” said one employee, adding that the long-term outcome “may include downsizing” and staff were prepared for redundancies. Others said the new management had done their best to reassure UniLad employees that the company had a future. “There’s a very mixed feeling among the staff – some dreading the future, some remaining positive as it could become a better run company with more opportunities,” said one. UniLad’s former management repeatedly complained about the administration process, claiming it was skewed to favour LadBible and excluded rival bidders. LadBible had helped to force UniLad into administration in the first place by buying up £5m of the company’s debt, with the entire administration process completed within a fortnight. The final sum paid for UniLad has not been disclosed, although the company had total debts of about £10m, including £1.5m owed to the taxman. LadBible said the deal “makes us the largest social video publisher ever” with more than 120 million followers. “In August alone, our combined videos were viewed 4.5bn times. We believe that the Unilad Group brands complement our existing offering and we can promise our audience more of the stuff they love from all the brands in the new LadBible Group family.”"

          "headline": "What next for photography in the age of Instagram?",
          "bodyText": "In 2012, I wrote an essay about the shifting nature of photography in an era of unprecedented image overload. Back then, Facebook users alone were uploading 300m photographs a day, while the number of images posted on Flickr and Instagram had exceeded the 11bn mark. I quoted the American artist and writer Chris Wiley, whose 2011 article, “Depth of focus”, in Frieze magazine, had expressed the anxiety of many practitioners about “a world thoroughly mediatised by and glutted with the photographic image and its digital doppelganger”. Wiley’s conclusion was pessimistic: “As a result, the possibility of making a photograph that can stake a claim to originality or affect has been radically called into question. Ironically, the moment of greatest photographic plentitude has pushed photography to the point of exhaustion.” Since then, the numbers have become even more mind-boggling: 350m photographs a day uploaded on Facebook; 95m photographs and videos shared on Instagram daily. The combined number of images shared uploaded on both platforms now exceeds 290bn, while there are 188m daily active users of Snapchat. Leaving aside for a moment anxieties about photography’s meaning in the social media age, one could argue from this evidence that it is the medium of our time, not just defining our globally connected digital image culture, but propelling it. Even a decade ago, no one could have predicted the seismic shift that has occurred in our relationship with – and use of – the photographic image. Back in 2012, the anxieties of many photographers tended to converge around the notion of authenticity: would digital technology undermine the craft of analogue photography and, more worryingly, its veracity? Would the invisible hand of Photoshop render not just the process, but the so-called “truth” of photography, obsolete? The arrival of the smartphone camera made all those concerns seem antiquated. It precipitated a new image culture in which photographs have assumed a fresh importance in our digitally mediated world, particularly the sharing of photographs on platforms like Instagram, where they are measured in likes, comments and repostings, all monitored by algorithms. Photography reflects, records and advertises our lives online. Is it, though, exhausting itself through its very ubiquity, losing its meaning in an age of almost unimaginable image overload? The superficial evidence would suggest otherwise. Over the past decade or so, there has been an attendant rise in interest in what you might call traditional photography culture. Although British art institutions were embarrassingly late in acknowledging the importance of photography curation – Tate appointed their first photography curator in 2009, almost 70 years after the Museum of Modern Art in New York did so – galleries are now finally according the medium the space it deserves as an art form. The new photography wing of the Victoria and Albert museum has just opened and, next spring, the Swedish organisation Fotografiska will open an 8,300 sq metre (89,000 sq ft) space in Whitechapel and another vast gallery in New York, both dedicated to contemporary photography. In the past few years, photography festivals and fairs have sprung up across the globe, challenging the commercial grandstanding of big established events such as Paris Photo and the annual Rencontres d’Arles. In September alone, Unseen Amsterdam and BredaPhoto were held in the Netherlands, Images Vevey in Switzerland, Organ Vida in Croatia and, closer to home, the Guernsey photography festival and the Brighton photo biennial. That’s more photography festivals in a month than there used to be in a year. The past few decades, too, have seen the photobook emerge as perhaps the most vibrant arbiter of photography culture. Small, independent photobook publishers proliferate; pop-up events around indie photobooks and zines draw a young and informed audience. Offprint, the photography publishing fair, attracts large, mainly younger crowds annually to its book markets in Paris and London. Flying in the face of the unstoppable flow of digital images online, traditional photography culture endures and proliferates, with both the photobook and the photo archive – material things that can be handled, browsed over, collected, exchanged – assuming a heightened importance. What, though, of the photography itself? Faced with the unprecedented flow of digital images, one has to ask if the traditional status of photography as a way of documenting the world has been altered irrevocably. Whither documentary in the post-truth era? Or portraiture at a time when the selfie has reduced the traditional idea of the self-portrait to a casual narcissistic reflex (282m selfies were posted on Instagram in 2016)? And what role does reportage now play in an age when the smartphone has made us all potential citizen (photo)journalists? The last question is particularly resonant when you consider the following incident and its immediate aftermath: on 20 June 2009, 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan was shot by a pro-government sniper near the scene of a protest against the Iranian government. The Iranian state had declared the protest illegal and barred foreign media from covering it. But the image of Agha-Soltan’s blood-streaked face as she lay dying was captured on the mobile phones of those around her and, within minutes, went viral. Within hours, footage of her death posted anonymously on YouTube was viewed by the American president. In a world where we are all able to fulfil the role of bearing witness that once fell to photojournalists how can traditional reportage compete? The anxieties that Wiley identified converge around not just the status, but the meaning, of photography in a digital world drowning in images. As I noted in 2012, though, “No amount of camera technology will turn a mediocre photographer into a great one, nor, in conceptual terms, will it transform a bad idea into a good one. For that, you would still need to possess a rare set of creative gifts that are to do with seeing, with deep looking.” I wonder now if that is still the case. Perhaps our relationship with the photographic print – for so long the standard of excellence and artistry – is changing in a world where so many images float unmoored from their context. As if to illustrate this, one of the most arresting pieces of work I saw last year was an installation by the Indian photographer Sohrab Hura, The Lost Head and the Bird, shown on a sped-up projection in a darkened, semi-derelict space in Peckham. It was a dramatic merging of the real and the possibly fictional, a stream of visceral images of life on the margins in India that had an almost hallucinatory intensity. Here, all the tired tropes of street photography were upended into a visual stream of almost subliminal images that jolted the viewer – the traditional, reformatted and revitalised. In contrast, another noteworthy series I first saw last year was Ex-Voto by English photographer Alys Tomlinson, which comprises black and white portraits and landscapes of contemporary pilgrims and holy sites in France, Poland and Ireland. (It has since won Tomlinson the 2018 Sony world photography award.) Using film, her work draws on the austere portraiture of August Sander and the human otherness captured by Diane Arbus. In its still, spartan style, it is the perfect merging of form and subject, reaffirming a tradition of craft and attentiveness. Increasingly, though, contemporary photography is all about, to borrow a term beloved by academics and curators, “interrogating the medium”, which often means shifting it away from documentary towards other, more conceptually driven art forms – abstract painting, sculpture, performance, video installation. To this end, younger photographers such as Daisuke Yokota and Maya Rochat, both included in Tate Modern’s recent exhibition, Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art, make work that is, on one level, a dynamic reflection of the dilemma of the contemporary photographer in an age of image overload. Yokota, for instance, has treated images with heat and iron powder, and subjected others to constant rephotographing, rescanning and reprinting. The results are closer to abstraction and make the idea of photography as a medium that simply records the world around us seem positively quaint. A glance at the range of processes that underpin contemporary photography practice attests to the fact that the medium is now performance, sculpture, abstraction, deconstruction and diary as much as it is documentary. None of this is entirely new. It is worth remembering, too, that although our contemporary image culture is without precedent in terms of its scale and its endless flow, there was another moment when technology sparked a surge in vernacular image-making. Back in the early 1960s, advances in analogue photographic technology brought the almost-instant photograph into the hands of millions of amateur American snappers through the Polaroid camera. In 1960, sales had reached 100m a year. By 1964, 5m Polaroid cameras had been produced. The proliferation of Polaroid snapshots marked the first wave of democratic photography, but it did not, as far as I know, induce collective anxiety in a transformative generation of photographers – including Arbus and Garry Winogrand – who were coming of age back then. What the Polaroid did do, though, was inform the image-making of an ensuing generation, underpinning the snapshot aesthetic of both Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, whereby the apparently mundane and casual was actually formally rigorous and deeply observed. Andy Warhol, too, instinctively understood the democratic power of the Polaroid, as his photographic portraits attest. For him, the medium – Polaroids of his celebrity friends or himself – was very much the message, not just elevating and celebrating the wondrous banality of everyday America in all its superficial glamour, but encapsulating it. Perhaps it is worth looking at the smartphone camera – and social media – in this way: how will they influence a generation of image-makers to come? Although certain influential photographers such as Eggleston and Shore had always insisted on the essentially democratic nature of their approach, the smartphone camera has already made photography democratic in a way that no one could have predicted. It placed compact, ultra hi-tech, relatively cheap image-making machinery in the hands of the many, not the few. What they did with it has already revolutionised not just the way we use photography, but the way we see – and share – the world around us. Shore is now an advocate and avid user of Instagram, which he has described as “a new means of distribution and a new means of communication [which] opens possibilities that didn’t exist before”. His Instagram images were included in a retrospective he had at MoMA in 2017. Like many photographers and artists, he relishes what he calls the “playful” nature of Instagram posts – “the kind of playfulness that I liked in the [photobook form], that I could try an idea for a day and explore it”. For him, he told the Tate in 2015, Instagram is also a platform that “celebrates images that are diaristic, that are brief glances, that are visual jottings, that are one-liners. It accepts complexity, but doesn’t demand it.” Instagram suits Shore’s approach, the observation and documenting of an everyday America, while the “community” he finds there seems in tune with his vision: “I find it very satisfying that they’re a group of people who look at each other’s work every day, and they’re all over the world.” The diaristic nature of Instagram seems crucial here, allowing photographers to try out ideas, document work in progress or simply alert people to what they are up to in terms of book publishing, exhibitions or talks. Interestingly, though, the younger American documentary photographer Alec Soth is less enthusiastic about using Instagram as a platform for his work. “When Instagram started, I was opposed to using it,” he says. “I was a fan of Tumblr – I found it more flexible and open and less prone to the ‘like’ neediness of Instagram. I also disliked the filters which, in the beginning, were the big draw to the platform.” It was only after one of his assistants suggested Instagram might be useful to promote his indie-book publishing company, Little Brown Mushroom, that Soth decided to give it a go. “The moment I started using Instagram, I was hooked,” he says. He had fallen prey to that “‘like’ neediness”. “Eventually,” he says, “I just succumbed to the flow like everyone else [and] I’ve lost so much interest in the platform lately.” Soth admits that Instagram can be a creative tool – “a place for me to experiment with an audience” – but fears that “a lot of the time it’s not much more than a branding tool”. He is suspicious, too, of its effect on our understanding or appreciation of photography. “I don’t think I have ever been moved the way I have with a great artwork, film or novel. Instead, the platform gives me little pellets of pleasure. I guess that’s what I dislike about it too – the addictive quality of those pellets rarely satisfies.” For all that, I have found Instagram to be a fertile ground for discovery. Among my favourite feeds are Simone White (@simonewhitemusic) who creates beautiful still lifes in natural light, the vernacular photography collection of Billy Parrott (@billyparrott), the extraordinary Japanese photobook collection @solitudeofravens, and @spacearchives, a feed about public art environments. Among more established artists, Cindy Sherman is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a trailblazer, using Instagram brilliantly as an extension of her practice. Joan Didion once declared: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” Instagram is also, of course, a way of telling stories – or creating narrative – about ourselves. Of late, contemporary photography has become a nexus for visual storytelling of an often stylised, metaphorical or semi-fictional nature. In 2014, Argentinian artist Amalia Ulman created an Instagram feed as a work of art in itself, creating a fictional persona as a Los Angeles “it girl”, and living it out for three months by posing for selfies in trendy restaurants, designer shops, international airports and luxury hotel lobbies. Having identified three social media archetypes of privileged femininity – “cute girl”, “sugar babe” and “life goddess” – she photographed herself in lingerie, at pole-dancing classes, and dining out with a tiny, cute designer dog on her lap. Ulman’s project inevitably precipitated a wave of online anger and outrage when she revealed that she was an artist. Her work was not just a critique of social media archetypes of glamour and success, but an exploration of how easily “followers” can be mesmerised and manipulated by the same. At its heart, too, was a complex dynamic: how photography can lie to expose a deeper truth. The following year, life inevitably imitated art, when the media reported that Instagram star Essena O’Neill, an Australian teenager with half a million followers, had deleted her account. She described it as “a contrived perfection made to get attention”. She pointed to posed selfies that helped her make an income from marketing products to her followers, and spoke of the all-consuming nature of a life lived on – and in thrall – to social media. Her posed selfies – so staged as to seem obviously performative – nevertheless mesmerised her followers to the point where even the most blatant product placement seemed invisible, or simply acceptable. Again, she, like Ulman, was castigated by those she had seemingly betrayed. The power of photography as a tool of fantasy and/or mass delusion is not new – the advertising industry was built on it – but now seems so powerful and so prevalent as to be disturbing. Next month, the Photographers’ Gallery in London hosts an exhibition titled, All I Know Is What’s on the Internet. It will feature the “contemporary artists seeking to map, visualise and question the cultural dynamics of 21st-century photography” in a social media age. To this end, it will “interrogate” not just the role and agency of the photographer in this new context, but “photography’s cultural value… at a time when the boundaries between truth and fiction, machine and human are being increasingly called into question”. It will include work by the intriguingly named Constant Dullaart, whose 2014 project, High Retention, Slow Delivery, targeted what he called “the contemporary attention economy” of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the “sharing mechanisms” of which – likes, retweets, followers, friends – stimulate “an appreciation system based on popularity over quality, and social skills over talent”. Dullaart’s work centres on what he calls “the capitalisation of community”. In all of this, Wiley’s anxiety about the creation of a new photograph “that can stake a claim to originality or affect” remains resonant. But it also sparks an attendant question, which is not so much what social media is doing to photography, but what an image-propelled social media culture is doing to us? Where is our agency in a world so dominated and driven by digital technology, so controlled by global corporations and invisible algorithms? One answer is that it is simply preparing us for the next seismic shift in technology: artificial intelligence. Though you may not have noticed it, AI is already ubiquitous, no more so than in photography technology. As Wired magazine reported recently, the latest Apple phones “come with new chip technology [that]… allows the new devices to offer slicker camera effects and augmented reality experiences”. It’s the latter phase, in all its sci-fi techno-speak, that heralds the future of smartphone camera technology. In February this year, researchers from Alphabet Inc’s DeepMind division released thumbnail images of a range of everyday subjects: a dog, a butterfly, a hamburger and an ocean view. All were AI-generated images produced from scratch by an algorithm called BiGAN. All look disturbingly like real photographs. Sooner than we think, it will be impossible for the human eye to tell the difference between an AI-generated image and a real photograph. The future is already here and photography is the medium shaping it – and us – in ways that make all these anxieties about the meaning of photography seem almost irrelevant. And, in another way – against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts, and artificial intelligence – more relevant than ever."

          "headline": "Digital contraceptives and period trackers: the rise of femtech",
          "bodyText": "Digital contraceptive techniques have been on the receiving end of bad press recently after Swedish company Natural Cycles was described as “misleading” by the UK’s advertising body, and a number of women complained about becoming pregnant while relying on the app. But that hasn’t stopped the industry from thriving, with the launch of Moody Month, which tracks hormones and menstrual cycles , and Flo Health, an ovulation calculator, being valued at $200m in the same week, suggesting there is still massive demand among women for products which are invariably described as femtech. Catering to a market that market analysts Frost &amp; Sullivan have forecast will be worth $50bn by 2025, femtech is the subset of apps and gadgets geared at enhancing women’s wellbeing. Currently made up of at least 200 startups worldwide, the companies focus solely on women’s health and are primarily managed by female CEOs and innovators. Woom, a fertility-tracking app that recently featured in Forbes’s list of 60 female-led startups, was started by Clelia Morales and Laurence Fontinoy, who left their jobs at eBay and Google respectively to launch the app after facing fertility issues themselves and raised £2mthrough crowdfunding. “The app uses an algorithm to optimise pregnancy, but it’s also educating women about their bodies”, said the co-founders. “We wanted to fill the knowledge gap and to help women feel in control,” says Clelia, now a working mum of two. Apps in particular are favoured by women and girls who want to track their moods, hormones and cycles, simply to have a better understanding of their bodies. Reproductiion is a major focal point for femtech, but the industry goes beyond that. Kitty Croft, 15, from London, uses the period and ovulation tracking app, Clue, and says most of her friends do the same. They all use an in-app feature to sync their data, meaning everyone knows where their friend is in their cycle. “To some this may seem slightly pointless, but to me it felt like a real shift in the way we see periods. People are embarrassed talking about periods, but this app makes them seem less of a shame and more of a way of life. It is a reminder that all women go through the same thing and no one should ever feel embarrassed about it. For my friends and I it is just another way for us to become closer, while also having a bit of a laugh.” Other notable companies include Elvie, a device that strengthens the pelvic floor and who recently launched a cordless breast pump; Lia, a discreet, biodegradable pregnancy test; Hey Vina!, a female friendship-making app; and L, an ethical, female-targeted condom brand. Developers in femtech are confident that the industry can help combat the dearth of women in scientific research, as well the social taboos around women’s health, from menstruation to postnatal depression and breastfeeding. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minster of New Zealand who returned to work six weeks after giving birth, recently described the wireless breast pump she uses at work as having “made it possible to do my job.” But currently just 10% of global investment goes to female-led startups according to Forbes. “It’s tough. 95% of the time you’re pitching to men who can’t relate to the product. Sometimes it’s uncomfortable,” says Woom’s Laurence, recalling a room of investors breaking into laughter at the mention of menopause. As women, “you have to show more [potential], more traction”, say the female founders. The duo also shared how people often assume they’re altruists running a social enterprise, joking: “You can’t just be women wanting to make money!” Elvie’s co-founder, Tania Boler, says the femtech “boom” is finally changing the face of the women’s healthcare industry. “Until recently, consumer tech often just meant making a pink accessory or turning something into jewellery. Now there is the realisation that women appreciate and want the best technology available,” she says. “While femtech started as a few niche companies solving women’s health issues it has added momentum to healthcare companies across the world, recognising the need for specialised solutions catering to women’s health,” says Shruthi Parakkal, a consultant at market analysts Frost &amp; Sullivan. This is why Portfolia, a US-based venture platform financed nearly exclusively by female investors, created the world’s first femtech fund in June. The fund is expecting to invest nearly $4m in six top-performing women’s wellness and health startups this year. Earlier this year, the NHS partnered with Elvie to offer their pelvic trainer, which normally costs £169, on prescription to patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The device is placed inside the vagina and connects to an app, which measures areas for improvements. SUI is a common problem affecting an estimated one in three women and costs the NHS £233m every year. The majority of cases can be reduced or eliminated by pelvic floor muscle training. The biofeedback within the device is thought to improve both compliance and success rates by 10% as well as reduce surgery rates by 50%, potentially helping to save the NHS £424 per patient. But femtech brands are not immune to the risks that befall any technological startup. Most notably, the Swedish-made contraceptive device Natural Cycles faced a backlash after several users became pregnant while using it and an advert describing the app a “highly accurate” method of birth control was found to be misleading by the Advertising Standards Agency. Meanwhile, whispers of elitism shroud products like Ava, the £249 hormone-mapping wristband . Many dislike the term femtech, seeing it as undermining an industry that caters to half the population. “There is a popular concept that most of the femtech companies are focusing on very women-specific issues such as fertility, reproductive health or menstrual health. However, it is interesting to note that there is a high prevalence of chronic diseases among women – sometimes one to two times higher than that in men – like Alzheimer’s. There are several companies working towards making specialised solutions for women with such conditions based on their physiology and psychology,” said Parakkal. “This kind of technology can increase accessibility to care, especially in developing countries and also rural areas – and especially for screening for chronic conditions, prenatal scans, cervical cancer screening etc. For example, cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings accounts for 80% of cervical cancer incidence and 95% of cervical cancer mortality.” Heidi Darling of Portfolia says the growth in femtech is down to female investors making conscious choices to support the products. “This is the action part of the #MeToo movement,” she said. “We [women] know that money is power, and that we can put our money to good use … [and to companies that] are changing people’s lives.”"

          "bodyText": "Asian stock markets are fighting back against the tide of selling seen in Wall Street again overnight. It’s a mixed picture in financial markets but the main points are: Tokyo (0.44%) and Sydney (o.o5%) are down. Seoul (1.1%) and Hong Kong (o.5%) are up, and Shanghai is flat. In currencies, the US dollar index is down slightly at 94.97. The Aussie dollar is up a bit in the past few hours at US71.21 while the yen is holding steady against the dollar. The pound is up at $1.323. The FTSE100 is seen opening up 0.1% while the Dax in Frankfurt will rise 0.6%, according to futures trade. Chinese exports grew 6.5% for the year so far, showing decent growth despite trade tensions. But the China customs agency warned that growth may slow in the fourth quarter Chinese media hints at state intervention to stem possible losses In Australia, mortgage lending was down 2.1% in August – more ethan the market expected and bad news for super-leveraged local housing industry Australia’s Reserve Bank said the country is at risk from some external shocks such as a US-China trade war or a slowdown in China. Catch up with our market wrap here: Or check out Richard Partington’s excellent explainer about why stocks are going down (or is that up?): And with that I’m wrapping up this blog. The inestimable Graeme Wearden will be back at 7am UK time. Thanks for joining me. And more still from China. The Shanghai Composite, which fell by as much as 6% on Thursday, was flat but in a sign of possible state intervention, the state-run Securities Times sought to soothe jittery investors by calling for more market-friendly policies from the government in Beijing. Courtesy of Reuters... Authorities “should roll out positive measures so that investors know the government cares about the stock market, while listed companies and financial institutions should also contribute to improving market confidence,” the media said State-owned Global Times said in an editorial that China’s stock market “has a limited impact on the whole Chinese economy, and the Chinese economy has withstood this round of impacts.” “What will happen to the US stock market and how it affects the US economy remain to be seen,” the Global Times editorial said. More on China. The country’s customs agency says foreign trade grow may slow in the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year. But reuters reports that spokesman Li Kuiwen says exporters are diversifying their markets, which will support overall export growth. The reflects a very strong start to 2018 – and a trade surplus of 1.44 trillion yuan (US$208.72 billion). But because it’s only the first three quarters we don’t know the full picture of how the trade tensions have impacted. Still with China, and the Shanghai market is exactly flat, while Hong Kong is up 0.5%. The Nikkei is off 0.44% and Sydney is just in the red by 0.05%. And in case you’re wondering what all this is about, you’re in good company ... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn’t have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It’s a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be “a positive development for financial stability” However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies – especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities – there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia’s banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn – much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It’s down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan’s big exporters. The Aussie dollar – a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region – has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We’re currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ’s profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank’s return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. “ANZ’s profitability is dramatically lower than it was,” he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (“it’s their money” he said). But Keogh said: “It’s not – it should have been in the customer’s pocket the whole time,” to which Elliott puts his hands up: “I accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to – but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.” In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn’t make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It’s Shayne.Elliott@anz.com The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. “Every case is unique and they should expect a response,” Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. “I give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.” He says he won’t always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he “will stay on top” of responding to customer’s concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he’s meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne’s interim report which found “greed” had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, “given what has been uncovered so far.” ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was “no pride” being the subject of regulator Asic’sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a “major fail”. He said “fear” was a “strong word” when it came to Asic, but the bank “certainly respects Asic”. Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. “The bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for ‘sales’ hasn’t been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don’t have that same middle layer, saying ‘middle management have a sales target, but the juniors don’t. We don’t have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday’s big moves. Losses are easing back already but it’s early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today’s data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We’re off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country’s biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you’re reading outside Australia and you haven’t followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We’re also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump’s comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as “out of control” because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it’s still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day’s trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I’m Martin Farrer and I’m taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday’s 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain’s FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields – the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday’s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum – the breadth of the decline – we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade – we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy – the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was ‘disappointed’ in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn’t intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It’s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful – and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell’s defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump’s claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I’m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump’s attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday’s Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here’s the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there’s nothing to celebrate -- instead, we’re staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday’s 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here’s our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump’s attempts to put pressure on America’s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 – the index of UK blue-chip shares – closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value – the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain’s FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It’s now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he’s determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump’s criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed’s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution’s independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed’s monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He’s escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump’s pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell’s predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America’s top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: “It’s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful – and it causes difficulty doing business.” Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I’m not going to fire him. I’m just disappointed. Here’s the big picture tonight, and it’s not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today’s losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don’t give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It’s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump’s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month’s midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. “Our multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” After a day of hectic selling, Britain’s blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It’s no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy’s main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government’s budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday’s 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week’s “financial market turmoil is (long) overdue”. He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president’s chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China’s president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is ‘concrete’, so don’t count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter’s WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday’s losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can’t be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn’t necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.” Donald Trump’s treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president’s criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday’s sell-off was a fairly normal event. “Markets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.” Yesterday’s sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here’s some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don’t panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should ‘stay calm’ today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn’t on the brink of a recession, so there’s no reason to dump your portfolio: “Isolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world’s most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today’s weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It’s still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today’s sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting “a little bit too cute,” adding: “They’re making a big mistake.” More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an ‘initial claim’ for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn’t rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren’t rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain’s FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the French CAC is down 1.5% while Germany’s DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan’s Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX ‘fear index’, which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve ‘crazy’, hasn’t helped the mood. The world’s top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump’s renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here’s a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America’s top central banker against Donald Trump’s claim that the Federal Reserve has ‘gone crazy’: Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it’s being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there’s a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today’s selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan’s main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain’s FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it’s been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now “we’ve talked ourselves into a sell-off”. Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: “The sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China’s growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. “But for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed’s expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF’s meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: “Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.” Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it’s harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There’s no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York’s 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday’s plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies’ costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump’s trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here’s a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China’s stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today’s sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That’s a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields – the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday’s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum – the breadth of the decline – we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade – we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy – the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That’s according to data provider MSCI, whose ‘all country’ index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That’s thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning’s heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It’s been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US – despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic – most notably Trump who’s been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months – I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn’t a shock: “The sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy’s new budget, on top of today’s other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China’s Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year’s trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund’s meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was “legitimate and necessary” for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That’s a rebuke to Donald Trump’s claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. “It is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high”. The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday’s selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal’s CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers’ suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: “Today’s equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.” Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: “This is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.” Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan’s Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as “crazy”.... “It’s a bit of a bloodbath,” said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. “It’s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.” European markets had already endured a bad week, and it’s about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain’s FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed ‘crazy’ for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: “The Fed has gone crazy. “No, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They’re so tight.” “It’s a correction we’ve been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.” The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump ‘achievement’), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what’s going on. The President’s criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.

          "headline": "Weaponised AI is coming. Are algorithmic forever wars our future?",
          "bodyText": "Last month marked the 17th anniversary of 9/11. With it came a new milestone: we’ve been in Afghanistan for so long that someone born after the attacks is now old enough to go fight there. They can also serve in the six other places where we’re officially at war, not to mention the 133 countries where special operations forces have conducted missions in just the first half of 2018. The wars of 9/11 continue, with no end in sight. Now, the Pentagon is investing heavily in technologies that will intensify them. By embracing the latest tools that the tech industry has to offer, the US military is creating a more automated form of warfare – one that will greatly increase its capacity to wage war everywhere forever. On Friday, the defense department closes the bidding period for one of the biggest technology contracts in its history: the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (Jedi). Jedi is an ambitious project to build a cloud computing system that serves US forces all over the world, from analysts behind a desk in Virginia to soldiers on patrol in Niger. The contract is worth as much as $10bn over 10 years, which is why big tech companies are fighting hard to win it. (Not Google, however, where a pressure campaign by workers forced management to drop out of the running.) At first glance, Jedi might look like just another IT modernization project. Government IT tends to run a fair distance behind Silicon Valley, even in a place as lavishly funded as the Pentagon. With some 3.4 million users and 4 million devices, the defense department’s digital footprint is immense. Moving even a portion of its workloads to a cloud provider such as Amazon will no doubt improve efficiency. But the real force driving Jedi is the desire to weaponize AI – what the defense department has begun calling “algorithmic warfare”. By pooling the military’s data into a modern cloud platform, and using the machine-learning services that such platforms provide to analyze that data, Jedi will help the Pentagon realize its AI ambitions. The scale of those ambitions has grown increasingly clear in recent months. In June, the Pentagon established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which will oversee the roughly 600 AI projects currently under way across the department at a planned cost of $1.7bn. And in September, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the Pentagon’s storied R&amp;D wing, announced it would be investing up to $2bn over the next five years into AI weapons research. So far, the reporting on the Pentagon’s AI spending spree has largely focused on the prospect of autonomous weapons – Terminator-style killer robots that mow people down without any input from a human operator. This is indeed a frightening near-future scenario, and a global ban on autonomous weaponry of the kind sought by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is absolutely essential. But AI has already begun rewiring warfare, even if it hasn’t (yet) taken the form of literal Terminators. There are less cinematic but equally scary ways to weaponize AI. You don’t need algorithms pulling the trigger for algorithms to play an extremely dangerous role. To understand that role, it helps to understand the particular difficulties posed by the forever war. The killing itself isn’t particularly difficult. With a military budget larger than that of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, France, Britain and Japan combined, and some 800 bases around the world, the US has an abundance of firepower and an unparalleled ability to deploy that firepower anywhere on the planet. The US military knows how to kill. The harder part is figuring out whom to kill. In a more traditional war, you simply kill the enemy. But who is the enemy in a conflict with no national boundaries, no fixed battlefields, and no conventional adversaries? This is the perennial question of the forever war. It is also a key feature of its design. The vagueness of the enemy is what has enabled the conflict to continue for nearly two decades and to expand to more than 70 countries – a boon to the contractors, bureaucrats and politicians who make their living from US militarism. If war is a racket, in the words of marine legend Smedley Butler, the forever war is one the longest cons yet. But the vagueness of the enemy also creates certain challenges. It’s one thing to look at a map of North Vietnam and pick places to bomb. It’s quite another to sift through vast quantities of information from all over the world in order to identify a good candidate for a drone strike. When the enemy is everywhere, target identification becomes far more labor-intensive. This is where AI – or, more precisely, machine learning – comes in. Machine learning can help automate one of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of the forever war: finding people to kill. The Pentagon’s Project Maven is already putting this idea into practice. Maven, also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, made headlines recently for sparking an employee revolt at Google over the company’s involvement. Maven is the military’s “pathfinder” AI project. Its initial phase involves using machine learning to scan drone video footage to help identify individuals, vehicles and buildings that might be worth bombing. “We have analysts looking at full-motion video, staring at screens 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 hours at a time,” says the project director, Lt Gen Jack Shanahan. Maven’s software automates that work, then relays its discoveries to a human. So far, it’s been a big success: the software has been deployed to as many as six combat locations in the Middle East and Africa. The goal is to eventually load the software on to the drones themselves, so they can locate targets in real time. Won’t this technology improve precision, thus reducing civilian casualties? This is a common argument made by higher-ups in both the Pentagon and Silicon Valley to defend their collaboration on projects like Maven. Code for America’s Jen Pahlka puts it in terms of “sharp knives” versus “dull knives”: sharper knives can help the military save lives. In the case of weaponized AI, however, the knives in question aren’t particularly sharp. There is no shortage of horror stories of what happens when human oversight is outsourced to faulty or prejudiced algorithms – algorithms that can’t recognize black faces, or that reinforce racial bias in policing and criminal sentencing. Do we really want the Pentagon using the same technology to help determine who gets a bomb dropped on their head? But the deeper problem with the humanitarian argument for algorithmic warfare is the assumption that the US military is an essentially benevolent force. Many millions of people around the world would disagree. In 2017 alone, the US and allied strikes in Iraq and Syria killed as many as 6,000 civilians. Numbers like these don’t suggest a few honest mistakes here and there, but a systemic indifference to “collateral damage”. Indeed, the US government has repeatedly bombed civilian gatherings such as weddings in the hopes of killing a high-value target. Further, the line between civilian and combatant is highly porous in the era of the forever war. A report from the Intercept suggests that the US military labels anyone it kills in “targeted” strikes as “enemy killed in action”, even if they weren’t one of the targets. The so-called “signature strikes” conducted by the US military and the CIA play similar tricks with the concept of the combatant. These are drone attacks on individuals whose identities are unknown, but who are suspected of being militants based on displaying certain “signatures” – which can be as vague as being a military-aged male in a particular area. The problem isn’t the quality of the tools, in other words, but the institution wielding them. And AI will only make that institution more brutal. The forever war demands that the US sees enemies everywhere. AI promises to find those enemies faster – even if all it takes to be considered an enemy is exhibiting a pattern of behavior that a (classified) machine-learning model associates with hostile activity. Call it death by big data. AI also has the potential to make the forever war more permanent, by giving some of the country’s largest companies a stake in perpetuating it. Silicon Valley has always had close links to the US military. But algorithmic warfare will bring big tech deeper into the military-industrial complex, and give billionaires like Jeff Bezos a powerful incentive to ensure the forever war lasts forever. Enemies will be found. Money will be made."

          "headline": "Uber UK strike: users urged not to cross 'digital picket line'",
          "bodyText": "Uber customers have been urged not to cross a “digital picket line” as British drivers with the app-based service staged their first coordinated national strike. Organisers of the 24-hour strike, which started at lunchtime on Tuesday – the latest part of a push to unionise the so-called gig economy – said many drivers logged off the app and stayed at home, while hundreds staged rallies outside the Uber offices in London, Birmingham and Nottingham. One reflection of the deep distrust between strikers and the company was a claim by those involved that Uber had intervened in the app’s pricing algorithm in order to generate a “surge” in prices to entice drivers to work. This was flatly denied by the company. The action follows an unprecedented joint national strike last week, branded the McStrike, by employees of companies including McDonald’s, Wetherspoons and TGI Fridays. The Uber strike was organised by United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD), a branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which is demanding an end to what it describes as unfair deactivations of drivers, an increase in fares to £2 per mile from a current rate of £1.25 in London, and a 10% reduction in commissions paid by drivers. The company has defended its pay record, adding that it had recently introduced sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections. Police arrived in force at Uber’s headquarters in east London after strikers and supporters tried to enter the building. Among those present was a driver who said anger had been building in recent months among his peers, who he said had been organising on WhatsApp. “I’ve worked for them for three years but it is getting harder to make ends meet,” said the man, who declined to give his name, citing fears that the company would “deactivate” him. He said he made between £500 and £600 a week for driving between 30 and 40 hours. “We’re in an extremely difficult position. I had an accident about two months ago and have trouble using one of my legs now, but the support from the company has not been there,” he said. Uber said the driver should be covered by sickness and injury protection it launched with the insurer AXA in June. Those involved in the strike are calling for the swift application of a 2016 tribunal judgment that rejected Uber’s classification of a group of drivers as independent contractors. Senior Labour figures backed the strike, including the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watsonand John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who said: “I support this strike for better employment rights and urge others to respect the app picket line.” Stephen Hull, a Birmingham-based driver and union organiser, said: “There is mass discontent among drivers because the oversupply of vehicles and the way that drivers earn their money is making it almost impossible to make enough to live.” Hull, who has been driving for Uber for three and a half years, said it had initially been a good experience thanks to bonuses for hitting targets. “Then they would start to phase out the promotions and it just got harder and harder,” he added. It is no longer his main source of income. “If I was to rely on Uber, I would be working 12 hours a day, six days a week to be able to make enough to survive.” Uber said: “We are always looking to make improvements to ensure drivers have the best possible experience and can make the most of their time driving on the app. That’s why over the last few months we’ve introduced dozens of new features, including sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections. An academic study last month found that drivers in London make an average of £11 an hour, after accounting for all of their costs and Uber’s service fee. “We continue to look at ways to help drivers increase their earnings and our door is always open if anyone wants to speak to us about any issues they’re having.” Tony Royle, a professor of industrial relations at the University of York, said the Uber strike and last week’s action against McDonald’s, TGI Friday’s and Wetherspoons were all symptomatic of a growing frustration at increasing income equality in the sectors concerned. “More strikes are likely as workers realise that collective action is an effective way to get their voices heard,” he said. The action is being watched from other countries where Uber has faced protests from drivers. Sarah Kaine, an associate professor at the University of Technology, Sydney, said that “alt-unionism” – sometimes involving spontaneous actions by workers that do not conform to the traditional pattern of strike behaviour or other industrial action – had been an interesting development. Separately, Uber was criticised by the chair of the London assembly’s transport committee for failing to attend hearings on Tuesday into the taxi and private hire market. “The transport committee was very disappointed that Uber was unwilling to attend,” said Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat member. “If we are to make progress in building a better future for this industry, it is necessary for all the players in the market to engage proactively and publicly. We would have preferred to question them in public, rather than in private. Londoners deserve to hear all sides of the story on this divisive issue.” Uber was contacted for comment but has yet to respond."

          "bodyText": "That makes it four games without a win for Barcelona in La Liga. That means Sevilla are top of the league, which makes for an interesting campaign so far. Messi’s goal was typically excellent but he was nowhere near the form he showed against Tottenham. Valencia defended very well, with Gaya and Garay, the goalscorer in the second minute, both excellent. 90 mins +2: Semedo gives away a cheap foul as Cheryshev goes back to tackle. That should be that. And it is. 90+1 mins: Barcelona looking frustrated and Valverde’s face is most displeased as his team toils. 90 mins: Dembele found space, which has been at a premium, but could not beat Neto. Suarez looked anguished as the ball failed to fall loose for him. There are two added minutes at full-time. 89 mins: Valencia sat deep, very deep, with a shield in front of their back four. Messi has not given up just yet, but time is running low. 88 mins: Final change for Barcelona: Arthur is coming off, and Rafinha is coming on. 86 mins: Messi is forced to his right foot, just like his previous chance, and can only deliver a pea-roller to Neto. He keeps knocking on the door, though, and it takes a Garay tackle to stop Messi squirming through. 85 mins: The time for a final push is coming. Valencia have kept their shape well under what has not exactly been an onslaught but has been heavy pressure nonetheless. 84 mins: Coutinho and Barcelona: it’s not quite coming off, is it? Shades of Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez shrinking in the shadow of Messi. 83 mins: Dembele is imminent, but has not been able to make his way on to the field. Valverde eventually brings him on and it is no surprise to see Coutinho leave the field. 81 mins: Valencia get some time to “rest on the ball” as Brendan Rodgers calls it. Cheryshev, who has put a shift in, wins a corner. Pique heads behind for another corner. Both are cleared away from danger for Barcelona. 80 mins: The pressure is on now. Messi saw a glimmer of a chance, having taken the ball down with his chest. He cuts inside but cannot hit the target. 79 mins: Kondogbia’s day is done and he looks tired as he leaves the field to be replaced by Arsenal legend Francis Coquelin. 78 mins: Messi, Suarez and Coutinho try to link up. Gabriel and Suarez clash, and Suarez goes to the floor. No penalty. Another attempt to hoodwink the ref has failed. 76 mins: Barcelona now dominating and Valencia resorting to the tactical foul. Legs are getting tired and this is where mistakes creep in. 75 mins: Coutinho had a clear sight of goal but deliberated after Messi’s pass. Gaya, excellent all night, makes a tackle he shouldn’t have been given chance to make. Again, Coutinho looks sluggish compared to Messi and Suarez. 73 mins: Messi is starting to step up things. One run takes him past four defenders, before his pass finds Suarez crowded out. Suarez tries to bludgeon his way through and use the shins of defenders. Instead, they clear the ball. 72 mins: It looks like Dembele is coming on for Barcelona. Coutinho would be favourite to vacate the scene. 71 mins: A free-kick chance for Messi, but the distance is too far even for him. He goes for power and the ball climbs all the way to its target and sails over the ball. 70 mins: Loose play from Valencia gives Messi a sniff but Suarez, the usual target for his passes, is hustled out of possession in the box. The same happens soon after once a couple of dips of the shoulder buy Messi some space, but Suarez is again blocked off. Rakitic is fouled. 68 mins: Valencia look the likelier here. Barcelona look tired and not a little listless. Four league games without a win may soon beckon. 66 mins: Off comes Gameiro and on comes Rodrigo, former Bolton legend. He learned at the feet of one of the greats at Bolton: Owen Coyle, no less. 64 mins: Vermaelen sends Alba down the flank but Valencia are able to clear. Gaya’s ball in is cleared by Vermaelen. Valencia are piling the pressure on a little here and seem to be at least level on possession with Barcelona. 62 mins: Both sides here have rather left the back doors open. Chances at both ends but neither forward line quite firing. Gameiro and Batshuayi don’t look much of a partnership while Messi and Suarez are both on the periphery. Coutinho is even more peripheral. 61 mins: There is the sound of woodwork being rattled but it is in fact the pole behind the goal when Gameiro tries an angled shot. 59 mins: Messi is found offside - is that something of a collector’s item? As it turns out, he wasn’t offside at all and it was a poor decision. The most gifted players are very rarely offside. 57 mins: Arthur, uncharacteristically, gives the ball away, and Gameiro has a chance to shoot. The shot is blocked. Some handbags in the middle: Parejo and Coutinho clash. Parejo is booked for pulling back the Brazilian. Coutinhi is booked for losing his temper and swinging in the vague direction of Parejo. 55 mins: Cheryshev is far quicker than Pique when the ball comes loose. He forces a corner. Parejo takes that, and once the ball comes back out, it is the Valencia captain who fires a long shot at goal. It was never on target. 54 mins: Messi springs into action. He weaves through, links with Alba, and his snap shot is saved down low by Neto. 53 mins: Barcelona trying to take the sting out of this; they are not at their best tonight and look a little leggy. The talk is of a World Cup hangover. Messi looks annoyed as his pass fails to find Rakitic but his team-mate did not read his thoughts. 51 mins: Cheryshev again is a weak link as he fails to find Gaya, speeding down the flank, when the full-back had bust a gut to get forward. 50 mins: Coutinho, coming in from his left-wing isolation, smashes in a right-footed shot. He goes close, but not close enough. 49 mins: Lovely swinging ball from Pique out to the flank. Alba on the overlap and his cross is knocked behind. Barcelona don’t make much of the corner. 48 mins: Cheryshev has an attempt on goal after an error from Alba. The ball drops into the Russian’s path and he shoots on sight. Ter Stegen was scrabbling and will have been pleased to see it fly over. 47 mins: Valencia lost something of their thrust in the first half when Guedes went off. Cheryshev proved no sort of replacement when he came on. 46 mins: Lionel Messi’s beard is growing back, anyway. Barcelona get the game restarted from the kick-off. The teams are coming back out of the tunnel and we are due to get back underway. Barcelona will try not to start as badly as they did the first half. Charles tweets in: “Is it awful that I want anyone - anyone at all - to stop Real or Barca winning La Liga again this year? I suppose Atlético or Sevilla are the best bets, but I just can’t see them being consistent enough against the smaller teams to go the distance.” Valencia’s early goal and a series of decent chances had Barcelona on the ropes but then came Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez’s link play for the equaliser, which was thumped home without prejudice. Barcelona not at their best, though. They are vulnerable at the back and Coutinho still looks a player without proper constituency. 45+2 mins: One last chance for Barça? No, Alba makes a mess of his attempt to get the ball in from the left flank. 45 mins: There are two minutes added on at the end of the first half. It peters out a little, with both teams having thrown plenty of effort in. 43 mins: Alba and Arthur link to try and set up Messi. The final ball is a bit overhit and Neto comes to clear up the danger. Messi appreciated the idea, though. Arthur seems to be a player of the type he enjoys playing with. 42 mins: There is a bit of needle being drawn in this game now. Vermaelen’s foul on Batshuayi is the latest infringement. Now there’s a yellow for Soler for a hack on Jordi Alba. 41 mins: Better from Valencia again. And Cheryshev as he buys a foul from Semedo, but the free-kick is taken short before Cheryshev goes back to normal when fouling Arthur. Meanwhile, Suarez has been booked for some dissent to the referee. 38 mins: Cheryshev finally gets involved in a positive fashion, setting up a chance for Gaya to surge on to. The shot Gaya hits has Ter Stegen flapping but Barcelona eventually get it clear. 37 mins: Suarez has been the main man for Barcelona tonight. He’s the player trying to make things happen. Messi is in absentia, but that’s his way these days. 36 mins: Barcelona lay heavy pressure on, but Valencia hold their shape. A couple of Suarez shimmies come to little. 34 mins: Since coming on, Cheryshev has given the ball away twice now and committed a silly foul. For some reason, he doesn’t look the player he was for Russia in the summer. 33 mins: A fresh air swing by Suarez after he and Arsenal legend Gabriel clash in the penalty area. No dive, and instead some embarrassment for the Uruguayan. 32 mins: Cheryshev, who has barely touched the ball since coming on, gives the ball away cheaply. Valencia are getting ragged. 30 mins: It has been a great opening half hour - certainly better than Liverpool v Manchester City was until Mahrez supplied his party piece. Barcelona games are better to watch when they are not as far ahead of their opposition as they used to be. The sterile domination era was fantastic but often short on excitement. Flawed Barça is very watchable Barça. 28 mins: Valencia are now sitting back deep. Their purpose of the early stages now a distant memory. Barcelona are not as fluid as in their Xavi/Iniesta era, but the danger still lurks. 27 mins: A closer look at the goal shows it was a crystal clear touch from Suarez that set up Messi. What a partnership they are. 25 mins: Kári Tulinius emails in: “In your preamble you forgot to mention that Sevilla are top of the league, thanks to their 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo. What a turn up for the books if at the end of this round, neither Real nor Barcelona are in the top two places. Mind you, no one in either Madrid or Seville is counting their eggs with well over an hour left to play of the match.” 24 mins: Did Suarez touch the ball there? Perhaps not, but his presence bought the space from which Messi drove the ball home. It’s often difficult to remember how hard he hits the ball. That link-up with Suarez does the job as the ball springs loose and Messi thrashes the ball home. 22 mins: Bit of VAR action as Suarez throws himself to the floor in the penalty area. The replay shows there was no case to answer. 20 mins: A mistake by Garay lets in Arthur and Coutinho, and the ball makes its way to Messi, who rips a shot loose but Neto makes the save, just as Netto supermarkets...no, I can’t go there. 19 mins: Barcelona again looking leggy in attack. Alba and Coutinho are not on the same wavelength and an attempt by them to link comes to nothing. 17 mins: Valencia look much the more dangerous but Suarez tries a long-range pot-shot after robbing the ball from Gabriel. It drifts over. 15 mins: Simon McMahon emails in: “Good evening ,John. A little bird once told me that Dundee United are the only team to have a 100% record against Barcelona. Played 4, won 4, I’m told. Can you confirm? Thanks.” I think that’s right, Simon, but perhaps others can confirm. 14 mins: Messi and Suarez attempt one of their linking sequences but Soler steps across to stop it and then Messi concedes a foul. 13 mins: Barcelona play some possession football. Their first objective is to take the sting from Valencia. Their second is to get Messi on the ball. 12 mins: A replay of the Valencia goal suggests Pique ducked under the ball, which was highly odd. Batshuayi, meanwhile, has yet another shot on goal. 11 mins: Guedes leaves the field and is replaced by Russian World Cup hero Denis Cheryshev. 10 mins: Messi has his first touch. It has been that long, and he can’t do much with the ball. Time for Coutinho to step up here? Guedes comes back on, but not for long. His knee took a nasty twist. 8 mins: Great noise from the home fans again. Gameiro’s shot gets the hackles raised with another shot. Barcelona rocking on their heels. 7 mins: Guedes, excellent in midweek against Manchester United, is down injured. he leaves the field having looked in some pain. He looks like he might come back on, though. 5 mins: Valencia go close again! Gaya storms down the left, Gameiro holds the ball up and Batshuayi shoots just wide. Ter Stegen was beaten...and they go close again Kondogbia fires in a long shot that again had Ter Stegen beaten. 4 mins: Ok, then, Lionel Messi, what have you got? Barcelona step into their passing rhythm as Valencia try to keep their defensive shape. 3 mins: Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde didn’t even get the chance to take his seast before that goal went in. The word is out: his team are not very good at defending. 2 mins: What a sorry mess that was for Barcelona. And what a noise greeted that goal. Valencia force an early corner. Parejo takes it. Kondogbia flicks on, Vermaelen misses it and Garay bundles home off Pique. Valencia take the kick-off and we are underway at the Mestalla. Two Valencia changes - Soler for Arsenal legend Francis Coquelin. And Kevin Gameiro comes in for Bolton legend Rodrigo. Valencia are the lowest scorers in La Liga. They hung on grimly against José Mourinho’s entertainers on Tuesday, and more of the same must be expected here against Barça. Mark Turner emails in: “King Arthur must be getting narked. Bench again. And he came from Bayern to sit there, too.” Barcelona’s run of three Liga matches without a win is their longest winless stretch in two years. For a club in supposed decline, that’s not bad, is it? Charles Antaki emails in: “Sometimes the easy and tempting answers might be right - Barcelona still haven’t adequately replaced Dani Alves nor Andres Iniesta; Semedo, the current incumbent, is inconsistent and prone to giving the ball away, while Coutinho, while a wonderfully skilful footballer, simply has too much to live up to. Or it might be the Catalan independence movement, or global warning.” Richard TW Arthur emails in: “’Arsenal legends Francis Coquelin and Gabriel are having a tough time.’” Yeah, yet more snide remarks about anything connected with Arsenal from the Guardian. Get over it, the lot of you!” Arsenal legend Francis Coquelin does not start this game. A reminder that, for all their Wembley wizardry, Barça have not won their last three league games. The rot started with a 2-2 draw with Girona, then that 2-1 loss to Leganés and a 1-1 draw with Athletic Bilbao. Here’s a nice preview from Harry Middleton of tonight’s ref. Thanks, Harry. “After the goal missed in last season’s fixture, Carlos Velasco (Spanish refs chief) appointed experienced referee Jose González González for this match.A Primera División since 2009, González is a pretty solid referee. Incredibly, despite not being an international referee, he had the highest mark average in LaLiga 2014/15, which considering the algorithm is used to favour those ten FIFA referees is quite impressive. The 44-year-old is not the biggest match-manager, nor the referee most liked by the players, but generally is a ‘safe pair of hands’ for big(ish) matches. VAR is Jose Sanchez Martinez.” Barcelona have made one change from midweek and that’s Vermaelen in for Lenglet. The Frenchman is still suspended for his VAR-snared forearm smash on a Girona player two weeks ago. A reminder here of what happened to Real Madrid yesterday. And some more Barney on the wonder of Luis Suárez. Here’s a reminder of the way Messi was in midweek. Let’s list those in a more analogue fashion. Valencia: Neto, Gaya. Paulista, Garay, Piccini, Guedes, Kondogbia, Parejo, Soler, Gameiro, Batshuayi Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Pique, Alba, Vermaelen, Coutinho, Sergio, Rakitic, Arthur, Suarez, Messi It was nice of Lionel Messi to remind the English of just how he good he is. We had completely forgotten how good the best player in the world is until he put Tottenham to the sword at Wembley. Anyway, back to the day job for him, and the chance for Barcelona to climb to the top of La Liga. Alavés’ Saturday night defeat of crisis club Real Madrid has meant Atlético Madrid climbed to the top after beating Real Betis this afternoon. Valencia are 16th in the table, and really not having much fun this season, though did draw 0-0 with crisis club Manchester United on Tuesday. Already, their hopes of returning to the Champions League look in severe lumber. Arsenal legends Francis Coquelin and Gabriel are having a tough time."

          "headline": "‘I spent seven years fighting to survive’: Chelsea Manning on whistleblowing and WikiLeaks",
          "bodyText": "Perhaps the most revealing part of my conversation with Chelsea Manning is what she doesn’t say. What she can’t or won’t talk about. It’s not that she doesn’t have a whole lot to say – she does, particularly about technology and how it can be used against us. Her job as an intelligence analyst for the US army, using data to profile enemy combatants – to be targeted and maybe killed – gave her an acute understanding of its potential uses and abuses. She understood the power of Facebook to profile and target long before the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted. “Marketing or death by drone, it’s the same math,” she says. There’s no difference between the private sector and the military. “You could easily turn Facebook into that. You don’t have to change the programming, just the purpose of why you have the system.” She understands this world; the overlap between military and civilian technologies that has caught us all in its dragnet. It’s her role in it that’s more opaque. She seems, still, at the beginning of a process of understanding what she did, what it all means, where she fits in. How in 2010, then aged 22 and presenting as male, she downloaded and leaked, via Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, 750,000 classified and sensitive documents that revealed America’s secret diplomatic cables and Iraqi and Afghanistan war logs. How she was caught, court martialled and sentenced to 35 years in prison. And how, in one of Barack Obama’s last acts as president, she was suddenly and unexpectedly granted clemency last year and freed. It’s a story that is as complex, complicated, conflicted and unresolved as perhaps Manning herself. The meaning, the significance, the consequences of what she did are not yet in any way settled or even stable. She was the hero who blew the whistle on the US’s relationship with the rest of the world and its hypocrisy. Or the traitor who committed crimes under the Espionage Act and betrayed her country. For some people, it’s both. Because Manning was the techie who turned. Turned the technology against the country that had developed it, turned its foreign policy inside out, turned herself into Chelsea and – an unforeseen consequence – turned WikiLeaks from a fringe actor into a new force in global politics. Before Manning, Assange was a leaking organisation without a significant leaker. Going to WikiLeaks was “instinctual”, she says. “I had this problem reaching out to the Washington Post. There was this lack of understanding about the dangers of [unencrypted] plain text communications at the time.” And she can’t or won’t reflect on what the organisation has become, if or how it’s changed over time and what role she played in ushering in an era of weaponised leaks that has led us to where we are now with Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump-Russian collusion, an investigation that encompasses WikiLeaks’ pivotal role in the US election. Manning can’t talk about a lot of what happened in detail. She says the US army has reclassified many of the documents that were previously public – and she’s also writing a book – so there’s a hesitancy to give things away ahead of time. But it also seems to run deeper than that. She doesn’t try to second guess the choices she made. “I don’t re-litigate my decisions,” she says. She can’t entertain the idea of history – or herself – taking another path. She resists reflection. “What I really try to tell people is [that if] I had done anything differently I would have been a completely different person; I can’t go back through this analysis.” But then there are whole swaths of Chelsea Manning’s history that she hasn’t quite worked out how to tell. “I don’t have a story in my head,” she says in an off-the-cuff moment when I ask her why she’s batted off my personal questions in our formal interview. “Some of it I haven’t been able to talk about. Solitary confinement, I just can’t talk about. I’ve not been ready to talk about it. I’ve blocked it out. I just can’t…” She shrugs. “I don’t know. I just remember breakfast, lunch, dinner, sleep, breakfast, lunch. I keep going back to that because what I remember is that the routine was my centrepiece to staying grounded.” At her trial in 2013, the judge officially recognised the abuse she’d been subjected to in pretrial detention and took time off her sentence to reflect it. She spent months at a time in solitary confinement, on suicide watch, at times stripped naked. “It’s there every time I wake up,” she says. “There’s not a day that I don’t wake up and have memories of my experience [of prison] driving me to be talking about this.” It seems unlikely that Manning’s trip to London last week will have made any of this any clearer. Stefan Kalmár, the ICA’s newish, politically minded director, had invited her to London to give a talk and be the guest of honour at a fundraising dinner hosted by Vivienne Westwood. It’s another jump cut for Manning. From a cage in the Kuwaiti desert, where she was exfiltrated after being caught while serving in Iraq, to the ICA’s Nash-designed villa a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace. Westwood shocks the audience, a well-heeled, gender-fluid art crowd, by referring a number of times – sincerely, but forgetfully – to Chelsea by her previous name. “He was my hero,” she says as hostility ripples through the audience and people shout: “It’s Chelsea!” There’s been so many of these cuts in her story. Manning has lived more lives than most and she’s still only 30. Her aunt painted a brutal picture of childhood isolation and neglect at her trial – her parents had problems with alcohol, her mother with a history of psychiatric problems. Later, she plunged herself into one of the most hyper-macho environments imaginable – an army unit in a war zone – just as her discomfort at her outward appearance as a man was becoming unbearable. She changed her name to Chelsea and decided to live outwardly as a woman the day after she was sentenced to 35 years in another hyper-macho environment – a male prison. Another rupture. And, then, suddenly and unexpectedly, in January 2017, she learned she would be released, Obama’s parting gift to Donald Trump, who railed against the “ungrateful TRAITOR” on Twitter but could do nothing about it. It was another difficult transition. “I’d became institutionalised… When you put somebody in prison for a while, you really develop a mentality to get you through that environment. Even just imagining being out of prison is difficult.” And you can see it, perhaps, in Manning’s stance, the way she faces the world. She appeared before the massed ranks of photographers on Monday morning for a press call outside the ICA, chin out, defiant. It was her first trip to the UK since her release and she was in London to be feted and celebrated, but in the photos she looks as if she’s facing another day of battle. Later, she was invited to pick out a Westwood outfit to wear at the gala dinner, and while Westwood wore a pink satin floor-length gown, Manning chose a sober black trouser suit that, as a German designer pointed out to me, “looks like Hillary Clinton doing Westwood”; it seemed more armour than adornment. Perhaps Manning, a trained soldier, is not yet out of the combat zone. “I spent the last seven years of my life fighting to survive,” she says. “And that was the main focus of everything. Y’all have had the opportunity to unpack it all. But I never did. I was in the mode of seeking hormones, seeking access to gender-confirming healthcare and then suddenly I’m out. And these things that were bothering me 10 years ago, well they’ve really intensified. And I haven’t really had time to unpack it.” It’s hard to overstate how radical Manning’s message is now. She’s engaging with grassroots activists who are organising protests and actions all over America and working with technologists to address the coming dangers of AI. America’s problems are way bigger than Trump, she says. “All these systems, our court system, our military, our prison system, the intelligence apparatus, have all been going through this buildup, buildup, buildup over several decades.” She calls it the “whirling death machine”, a “nationalist authoritarian regime” that has only speeded up under Trump. And she believes the solution won’t necessarily come through the ballot box. She campaigned in a Senate race last year but she also favours Malcolm X-style direct action, up to and including breaking the law. “I am there to stand in support of folks whenever they go out there and protest. I saw these local activists in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, pull down a Confederate statue and it was the most fucking inspiring moment in my life to say the least.” They didn’t wait for permission, she says. And “by going outside the bounds, they changed the conversation”. But how far should you go? I ask. If the other side also takes direct action, won’t you have a complete breakdown of law and order? “Law and order is already broken down. That’s why there’s unrest. Whenever you have authoritarian power, centralised power that ends up affecting millions of people, you’ve already had a system breakdown.” Isn’t this like advocating for armed revolution? I ask. For civil unrest? “Well, I mean violent acts are happening to us all the time. It’s a question of self-defence… Whenever people are advocating for or alluding to ethnic cleansing, any time you’re discussing the possibility of an entire group being suppressed, or removed from society, that is violence.” In June, Manning ran (and was defeated) in the Democratic Senate Primary in Maryland. Her campaign offered a radical agenda that included proposals to abolish border controls and the prison system and she went “door to door, listening”, an experience that drove her “closer and closer to being on the edge of really deep, dark depression…” There was an incident, wasn’t there, I say. I’d hesitated to bring it up, but she confirms that there was, that she’d been exhausted and had tweeted a photo of herself on the ledge of a building. It was quickly deleted and there followed a message that she was with friends and safe. She’d attempted suicide twice in prison but it’s shocking to realise this was in May, just a few months ago. It was at an army field base that Manning took the decision she did. In the US, she says, her job had been “abstract math”. It was only when she was posted to Iraq that she understood properly that the numbers represented people. She realised her world entailed “not just database records. These are human beings. Their hopes and dreams and desires are all tied up in this.” There’s a record of her mental state at the time in the logs of chats that she had with a hacker, Adrian Lamo, whom she met on an online forum. They were later published in Wired magazine, though she can’t confirm these conversations or talk about them for legal reasons – the material was reclassified after the trial – but they’re a compelling read, especially with the knowledge that, unknown to her, Lamo was working with the FBI and would later turn her in. In their chat, she refers to watching the video that she leaked to WikiLeaks, which WikiLeaks in turn released to the world under the title “Collateral Murder”, that shows a bird’s-eye view of US soldiers shooting a group of Iraqis, which turned out to include a pair of Reuters journalists. “I don’t know,” she told Lamo. “I’m just weird I guess. I can’t separate myself, others. I feel connected to everybody… like they were distant family. I… care?” When I suggest she lacks a layer of skin, Manning says matter of factly: “I mean I have empathy. That’s what it is.” It’s a quality that’s in short supply in Silicon Valley, I point out. “I think there’s a culture that discourages it,” she says. I wonder what her take is on its notorious gender imbalance, having worked in tech as both a man and a woman. How has she found the tech bros? “I’m trans. I was trans before and I’m trans now. But when I was presenting as male, I was still very feminine so there was always that issue that I was never good enough. I was never male enough to be widely accepted. And now that I’m presenting as female the same issues are there.” Not fitting in has been the defining feature of Manning’s life. She spent four years in Haverfordwest, not fitting in as a teenager, when her Welsh mother returned home to the UK after divorcing her father, though she appreciated certain aspects of her Welsh comprehensive school. “I learned things that weren’t talked about in America. The civil rights movement is glossed over in most American textbooks.” It’s striking, I say, reading the Lamo logs, just how alone she was. It took a year for me to get Christopher Wylie on the record to talk about Cambridge Analytica, I tell her, partly because it was a matter of finding the right support for him, whereas she undertook this incredibly bold and brave move entirely alone. “I wasn’t isolated,” she shoots back. “There were 30 people on my base.” Perhaps, but it’s not what she said in the online chats at the time. “I’ve created a massive mess,” she tells Lamo. “I’m very isolated atm… lost all of my emotional support channels… family, boyfriend, trusting colleagues… I’m a mess.” The 30 people on her base are described at the time as “trigger-happy rednecks” and “the only safe place I seem to have is this satellite internet connection”. Some have questioned whether Assange was directing her as to what to look for, what to leak, which may be another reason why she’s shying away from the question, just as at the ICA-hosted Q&amp;A she avoids a question from the audience about whether she still supports him. What strikes me reading the conversations with Lamo is the sheer psychic weight of the secrets she was carrying: Her personal secrets; state secrets; America’s secrets. She tells Lamo she’d sent her superior a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and was waiting to be sent back to the States – “all while witnessing the world freak out as its most intimate secrets are revealed”. It reminds me of the 1970s feminist slogan, the personal is the political, but Manning rejects it. “I don’t want to make that connection. I didn’t leak because I’m trans. That’s not it. But certainly the values that I have have been shaped by who I am and there’s a connection with that.” Manning’s accompanying note to the leak said that she wanted to illuminate the “fog of war”. She wanted to “reveal the truth of 21st-century asymmetric warfare”, a term we now understand I say, because it’s what Russia is waging on us. “Right. Election interference. The United States has been doing this in Latin America for decades.” Is it blowback? “Everyone’s got a little dirt on their hands, so I’m hesitant to say that this is coming from Russia when other countries are doing this. Across the board, election interference is not good.” Manning doesn’t like the word “whistleblower”. It makes political change seem like an exclusive club, she says. She wants everyone “to realise they have political agency”. The problem the world has now, she says, “is not an information problem, it’s an action problem”. Just as trans issues now have “more visibility. But visibility is not the same as equality.” We know what’s going on, she says, in politics, in technology. We’re just not doing enough about it. It slightly amazes me that there haven’t been more whistleblowers from inside the tech industry, I say. “That will change,” Manning says. She believes the tech community, the developers, will recognise their power, their responsibility. At the same time, she offers a chilling vision of where we’re heading with artificial intelligence, of systems that are already beyond our control. “There is something really deep going on inside machine-learning systems, especially neural network-type machine learning… I’ve started to think of algorithms as primitive living entities. When I work with neural networks I get this chilling feeling. They’re acting like inorganic life forms.” Manning is still feeling out her new role in the world. She movingly describes the 300,000 letters of support she received in prison (another 220,000 were sent, as part of an Amnesty International campaign, to Obama, asking for her release), support that she’s attempting to pay forward now, though she still seems a singular, lone figure. While waiting to go on stage to host a Q&amp;A session at the ICA, I tell her that a friend of mine, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who paved the way in investigating Cambridge Analytica, sent her a book in prison. It was on the Riemann hypothesis – an unsolved theorem about the distribution of prime numbers – and though we’ve just been discussing how exhausted she is after a 14-hour day, her eyes light up. “That was such an important book to me! I’m obsessed with prime numbers.” It’s the most animated I’ve seen her. “They’re magical, impossible to predict, you can’t build an algorithm to detect them, but they’re in nature. Nature understands prime numbers.” They’re also, she points out, important in cryptography. To secrets. They underpin encryption technology. It’s a fascination Manning shares with Assange. With Dehaye. With the keepers of secrets and the leakers of secrets. Manning can’t or won’t look back; can’t or won’t imagine other lives or other decisions; hasn’t yet processed the impact of her actions on the world. But for a moment, there’s a glimpse of another Manning. A private individual with a private life doing nerdy things with numbers. Because she didn’t just make the US’s secrets public, she made her own life public. And she, us, we’re grappling with that still.

          "headline": "Viral publisher Unilad blames arch-rival LadBible for collapse",
          "bodyText": "The money has run out for Unilad and so has the banter, with staff at the viral Facebook publisher, which has collapsed into administration, partly blaming the nifty financial footwork of arch-rival LadBible for leaving hundreds of jobs on the line. The Guardian has learned that Unilad’s administration on Thursday was accompanied by the decision of LadBible to buy up a substantial part of the company’s debt, prompting accusations that one group of lads is attempting to drive the other group of lads out of business. It has also been established that Unilad’s debts are in the region of £10m, larger than previously reported, with half of that now owed to LadBible – meaning Unilad’s main rival is now a key voice and potential bidder in any takeover talks for the company. Understanding this story involves unwrapping the strange tale of how two Facebook-centric outlets, both run by twentysomethings with an instinctive understanding of how to get attention online, rose to prominence as part of the viral publishing boom that began in the early 2010s. It’s also a cautionary tale of how even companies that dominate the world of online publishing – LadBible is the biggest Facebook publisher in the world, with Unilad in fourth place – can reach tens of millions of people thanks to a diet of animal videos, sports clips and shocking news stories, but still find themselves struggling financially. “We had an offer of purchase from LadBible two weeks ago and they were very keen to take out their biggest competitor,” UniLad’s managing director, John Quinlan, said, claiming the administration process is flawed and could leave his staff out of work. “As soon as they heard about the situation with Alex’s debt they went very quiet.” “Alex” is Alex Partridge. He was a student in 2010 when Facebook was sweeping across university campuses and was one of the first people to realise the potential of Facebook pages to reach a large audience through the site with a stream of occasionally sexist and homophobic viral “banter”, which drew headlines at the peak of the concerns over the spread of lad culture. One of the pages created by Partridge was LadBible, which he sold to another student named Solly Solomou, who developed it into a successful business. Another was Unilad, which Partridge agreed to develop into a standalone company with two partners before being forced out in 2013, prompting years of legal proceedings which ended when a high court judge awarded him £5m. Unilad’s parent company, now employing more than 200 people in Manchester, London and New York, struggled to service the debt and it was Partridge – plus an unexplained £1.5m tax bill – who pushed them into administration. Quinlan said his company has been lining up outside investment in a bid to stay solvent and save jobs but this was derailed by LadBible’s interest in Partridge’s debt: “A couple of weeks ago we had a proposal that we accepted. But that was before Alex sold his debt to a third party and that changed the dynamics.” LadBible confirmed they had made an approach for Unilad but insist they were rebuffed. “After the administrator was appointed we acquired Alex Partridge’s debt of £5m … We want to get the best recovery we can for the debt that we own.” Unilad’s ability to operate as an ongoing business is also under threat as employees lose access to the site. In an email to staff, Quinlan said that the administrators had locked Unilad staff out of the site’s WordPress account, meaning they are unable to write articles and update the homepage. The social media team is also allegedly locked out of the licensing platform that Unilad uses to find and buy videos to maintain its Facebook pages. “These actions are not consistent with keeping the business running operationally and maintaining value in the business,” said Quinlan, insisting the situation had been “escalated to the highest levels politically” and urging Unilad’s staff to contact their local MPs. One industry insider with knowledge of Unilad described it as a very good business that’s been grossly mismanaged and is paying far too much money on staff for a company with a revenue of £10.7m a year. “It does good revenue and good profit but cannot sustain itself,” the insider said. Other individuals with knowledge of the administration said Unilad was paying for leases on large amounts of equipment, including computers and a table football game. Both companies developed their original Facebook pages into advertising businesses while attempting to shed their old un-PC reputations, often with a focus on original material around themes such as men’s mental health. At one point LadBible even decided to rebrand what a “lad” meant, pointing out that a large number of women view its content. Still, not everything changed. LadBible was forced to apologise earlier this year after it accidentally hired a topless dancer for its summer party and Unilad’s co-founder left the site around the same time after a former employee posted accusations of misconduct and drug use. But while LadBible grew and diversified away from Facebook into Instagram and original series, winning several awards at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Unilad remained Facebook-centric, meaning it was hit hard by this year’s algorithm changes, according to staff. Quinlan continued to claim that his site has “got a better product” than LadBible and claimed the administrators had worked with LadBible to set a tight timeframe. Expressions of interest are due over the weekend, with the leading party then due to place a non-refundable deposit with the aim of concluding a deal within a week. The administrators Leonard Curtis did not respond to specific criticism from Unilad’s current owners, but said they had had a “significant level of interest and commenced providing interested parties with information”. One employee at Unilad’s Manchester office, which focuses on editorial output, described staff – mainly aged under 25 – as “riled, crying, and arguing” while facing up to the possibility of not being able to pay the rent at the end of the month. They also reported that the London office, which handled head office functions and sales, had been closed completely. “LadBible is a rival of ours, we have arguments with them every day,” said the employee. “The consensus is that LadBible is going to buy us, shelve us, and then make us redundant.” LadBible did not comment on whether they wanted to shut down the site, or whether – as the main creditor – they were interested in buying Unilad’s assets: “We don’t know enough yet to form a view and ultimately, it’s up to the administrator.”"

Your options are as follows: head to the shops and buy the single on CD, which doesn’t feel very on-demand; buy it as a download, the quality of which is as flimsy as Basshunter’s subsequent career; navigate through a labyrinth of occasionally pornographic popups to download it illegally; or sit through Scouting for Girls five times until it comes on the radio. Ten years on, Spotify has erased these costly or frustrating scenarios. You can instantly access not just Now You’re Gone, but deep cuts from Basshunter’s oeuvre such as From Lawnmower to Music or his oft-overlooked Christmas single Jingle Bells (Bass). And, indeed, the majority of popular music made by anyone ever. The result is music’s most radically democratic era. While adverts between songs jarringly juxtapose the beauty of art with the brutality of capital, it is at least free to listen to them. Thanks to Spotify and YouTube, no one with internet access – 90% of the UK – needs to pay for music, an important and seismic shift from the vinyl, CD and download eras when, for many people, music ownership was a luxury or treat. For £9.99 – the going price of one newly released CD album in 2008 – you can have uninterrupted access for a month. You can already hear the effects of this democracy on music itself. The global profile of non-Anglophone pop has risen, from K-pop band BTS to Puerto Rican star Daddy Yankee, in part thanks to this levelled playing field; the multicultural hybrid music of stars such as Stefflon Don feels like the natural result of a culture that can access anything, anytime. Critics point out that you don’t own the music you pay Spotify for, but effectively rent it, although the “ownership” of digital files was always pretty illusory and underwhelming anyway – and, as anyone who has tried to copy a library of iTunes files from one device to another, a teeth-gnashing faff. As the parallel demise of Blockbuster Video and, er, print media shows, most people value convenience over physicality when it comes to film, news and music. It can also be argued that Spotify’s quality is lower than that of a CD, which is true, and the muso in me trembles to think how many people are listening to Spotify on its low, data-preserving quality, which sounds as if the songs have been irradiated. But its 320kbps “high quality” setting will satisfy all but the most sensitive listener. Spotify speaks to this silent majority of music fans. Audiophiles, object fetishists, anti-capitalists, musicians – these groups noisily protest Spotify, but are marginal compared with the number of ordinary listeners, who never read the liner notes in the first place. For many people, music is just for mood, something to work, exercise or have sex to – situations that Spotify usefully caters to with playlists such as Productive Morning, Extreme Metal Workout and 90s Baby Makers. It is a badge of pride for musos to say that Spotify’s machine-learning algorithms – when you listen to a track and it recommends things you might also like – don’t cover their cosmopolitan taste. But there are plenty more people who have relatively narrow taste, for whom – in a world where not everyone has the time or inclination to read up on new music – this kind of recommendation is really cherished. And if you do happen to have catholic taste, or fannish obsession, there are some very deep back catalogues to go down (even, should you so desire, Basshunter’s). There are debates to be had over revenue sharing and the acts it chooses to promote, but Spotify’s free, total access makes it essentially utopian. Ben Beaumont-Thomas The case against Spotify If I compiled the off-record remarks from my interviews over the past decade, the majority would concern Spotify – namely how much artists hate it. “Please don’t put that in,” they panic after slagging it off. “I really need it to support my new album.” And they do: Spotify is a kingmaker. After the early 2000s doldrums, the recent music industry revenue boom is thanks to the rise in streaming. It is well known that artists don’t see much of this. Spotify’s royalty rate is notoriously low. The top 10% of artists dominate 99% of streams – as Ed Sheeran getting 16 tracks in the Top 20 after the release of ÷ showed. Still, Spotify’s patronage – putting artists in its powerful playlists, which drive streams – is crucial. Musicians can’t afford to complain. At a relatively affordable £9.99 a month for an ad-free subscription, Spotify benefits the consumer more than the artist – superficially. Its exploitative relationship with musicians has trickle-down effects. The most basic is that any artist who can’t afford to make music is not going to be making much more of it – or they will have to tour for longer (costing their health and creativity) and find alternative revenue streams to survive. But just as musicians realised they couldn’t afford to be sniffy about “selling out”, after the puritanical 90s, Spotify undermined that undesirable alternative, too. As critic Liz Pelly writes in an essay for the Baffler, brands don’t have to pay to use songs on adverts if they want to piggyback an act’s cred – they can put them on branded playlists without asking permission or paying a penny. Setting aside the issue of money, these playlists have fundamentally changed the listening experience. Spotify prides itself on its personalised recommendations, which work by connecting dots between “data points” assigned to songs (from rap, indie, and so on, to infinite micro-genre permutations) to determine new music you might like. Its model doesn’t code for surprise, but perpetuates “lean-back” passivity. There is no context on the platform, merely entreaties to enjoy more of the same: “You like bread? Try toast!” It limits music discovery and the sound of music itself. Singles are tailored to beat the skip-rate that hinders a song’s chances of making it on to a popular playlist: hooks and choruses hit more quickly. Homogenous mid-tempo pop drawing from rap and EDM has become dominant: New York Times pop critic Jon Caramanica regularly disparages this sound as “Spotifycore”. The algorithm pushes musicians to create monotonous music in vast quantities for peak chart success: hence this year’s tedious 106-minute Migos album, Culture II, and Drake’s dominance. Add in Spotify’s hugely popular artists with no profile outside the platform, widely assumed to be fake artists commissioned by Spotify to bulk out playlists and save on royalties, and music appears in danger of becoming a kind of grey goo. Spotify looks like a neutral platform but behaves like a gatekeeper. It faced a backlash this year after censoring R Kelly and XXXTentacion for their alleged acts of violence against women (only to grossly promote XXX after his murder). Why were only black men censored when many white male rockstars have violated women? It continually perpetuates such inequality: a report by Pelly found that despite the “woke optics of playlists like Feminist Friday”, women are underrepresented on its most popular playlists. (Meanwhile, Drake benefited from Spotify’s first “global artist takeover”, his face and music appearing on every editorialised playlist when he released this year’s Scorpion.) These function as echo chambers, popularity begetting more support, the antithesis of musical democracy. Look: I pay my £9.99 a month. I use Spotify to make playlists for friends’ weddings and to compile 80s curios I discover on TOTP reruns. The genie isn’t going back in the bottle. But we can be responsible listeners (I buy albums I listen to more than five times) and hold Spotify to account because the people it is meant to benefit can’t. Any platform that intimidates the creators that underwrite its business is truly dystopian. Laura Snapes"

          "bodyText": "You cowered to Playtest. You swooned to San Junipero. You’ve scratched your head at that one about the angry robot dogs. And now it’s time for the next step: controlling your own Black Mirror episode. Bloomberg reports that the next series of Black Mirror will have an interactive element. According to the report, one episode is being planned around a branching Choose Your Own Adventure narrative, allowing users to move the story forward at set points by clicking one of several on-screen options. This isn’t exactly new territory for Netflix – it has already experimented with the form with its Puss in Book special – but of all its original shows, Black Mirror seems the most sensible choice. Nobody wants an interactive House of Cards episode, for example, unless some of the options include “drift off and wander away” or “delete the last three series out of basic human decency”. But Black Mirror is forward-thinking and open-minded enough to allow such an experiment. Best of all, Black Mirror is the sort of series that nobody can fully agree on. Some people love the dark, grimy episodes that revel in a surface-level nihilism, for instance, and those of us who aren’t 13-year-old boys are more attracted to episodes such as San Junipero or Hang the DJ, where all the grisly future paranoia is replaced with something approaching recognisable humanity. An interactive episode has the potential to be all things to all people. Say it is an episode where a new type of toaster is invented that is powered by the like-clicks underneath a video of someone being maimed. If you’re a dark Black Mirror fan, you can choose a path where all the worst things happen and all the characters end up broken and bleeding, their bodies spelling out the word “WHY?” on a burning hilltop as every Radiohead song ever recorded plays simultaneously in the background. But if you’re an optimist, you can pick a path that allows the orphan to fall in love with the toaster inventor, and for them to break free of the oppressive system that created them both, before the inevitable twist ending reveals that they’re both actually molecules in a dying man’s fart cloud. See? Something for everyone. Better yet, whatever this episode turns out to be about, it will be the most watched episode of Black Mirror ever. Interactive narratives are always watched and rewatched over and over, as viewers try to discover every permutation of every story. The interactive film Tender Loving Care, for example, begged people to rewatch, not least because some of the options resulted in gratuitous nudity. And I’ve watched Puss in Book more times than I’d care to admit, even though it really isn’t very good at all. Something like Black Mirror would amplify this. Any given episode is already subject to countless recaps, but this would allow recappers to argue among themselves over which string of decisions made for the most compelling story. It might even bring about a whole new way of reviewing television, even though the world absolutely does not need that. And, of course, Netflix would be deluged with usable data. Every choice made by every user would signal a preference of storytelling that the platform can use to its advantage. It already knows the shows that certain ultra-specific demographics are most likely to watch, but an interactive Black Mirror will go one further. It will reveal the individual story beats that each demographic favour at any given time in an episode. Soon it will be able to predict how every single episode of television we ever watch should go, and create an algorithm that writes our scripts for us, and we’ll all be trapped in a ceaseless hell of AI-derived storytelling. And, at that moment, Black Mirror will have eaten itself."

          "bodyText": "Sinakhone Keodara reached his breaking point last July. Loading up Grindr, the gay dating app that presents users with potential mates in close geographical proximity to them, the founder of a Los Angeles-based Asian television streaming service came across the profile of an elderly white man. He struck up a conversation, and received a three-word response: “Asian, ew gross.” He is now considering suing Grindr for racial discrimination. For black and ethnic minority singletons, dipping a toe into the water of dating apps can involve subjecting yourself to racist abuse and crass intolerance. “Over the years I’ve had some pretty harrowing experiences,” says Keodara. “You run across these profiles that say ‘no Asians’ or ‘I’m not attracted to Asians’. Seeing that all the time is grating; it affects your self-esteem.” Style blogger Stephanie Yeboah faces the same struggles. “It’s really, really rubbish,” she explains. She’s faced messages that use words implying she – a black woman – is aggressive, animalistic, or hypersexualised. “There’s this assumption that black women – especially if plus sized – go along the dominatrix line.” As a result, Yeboah went through phases of deleting then reinstalling many dating apps, and now doesn’t use them any more. “I don’t see any point,” she says. Racism is rife in society – and increasingly dating apps such as Tinder, Grindr and Bumble are key parts of our society. Where we once met people in dingy dancehalls and sticky-floored nightclubs, now millions of us look for partners on our phones. Four in 10 adults in the UK say they have used dating apps. Globally, Tinder and Grindr – the two highest-profile apps – have tens of millions of users. Now dating apps are looking to branch out beyond finding “the one” to just finding us friends or business associates (Bumble, one of the best-known apps, launched Bumble Bizz last October, a networking service using the same mechanisms as its dating software). Glen Jankowski, a psychology lecturer at Leeds Beckett University, says: “These apps increasingly form a big part of our lives beyond dating. Just because this occurs virtually doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be subject to the same standards of real life.” For that reason it’s important that the apps take a stand on intolerant behaviour. Bumble’s Louise Troen acknowledges the problem, saying: “The online space is complicated, and people can say things they wouldn’t say in a bar because of the potential ramifications.” Safiya Umoja Noble, author of Algorithms of Oppression, a book detailing how search engines reinforce racism, says that the way we communicate online doesn’t help, and that in person there are more social conventions over who we choose to talk to, and how we choose to talk to them: “In these kinds of applications, there’s no space for that kind of empathy or self-regulation.” Jankowski agrees: “There are certain things some people would say on dating apps that they wouldn’t say in real life, like ‘black = block’ and ‘no gay Asians’.” However, Troen is clear: “Whenever someone says something like that, they know there is an army of people at Bumble who will take immediate and terminal action to make sure that user doesn’t have access to the platform.” Others are coming round to the same belief – albeit more slowly. Earlier this month, Grindr announced a “zero-tolerance” policy on racism and discrimination, threatening to ban users who use racist language. The app is also considering the removal of options that allow users to filter potential dates by race. Racism has long been a problem on Grindr: a 2015 paper by researchers in Australia found 96% of users had viewed at least one profile that included some sort of racial discrimination, and more than half believed they’d been victims of racism. More than one in eight admitted they included text on their profile indicating they themselves discriminated on the basis of race. We don’t accept “No blacks, no Irish” signs in real life any more, so why do we on platforms that are a major part of our dating lives, and are attempting to gain a foothold as a public forum? “By encouraging this kind of behaviour, it reinforces the belief that this is normal,” says Keodara. “They’re normalising racism on their platform.” Transgender model and activist Munroe Bergdorf agrees. “The apps have the resources and should be capable of holding people accountable when they behave in a racist or discriminatory way. If they choose not to, they’re complicit in that.” Noble is uncertain about the efficacy of drawing up a list of forbidden words. “Reducing it down in the simplest forms to a text-based curation of words that can and can’t be used, I haven’t yet seen the evidence that this will solve that problem,” she says. It’s likely that users would get around any bans by resorting to euphemisms or acronyms. “Users will always game the text,” she explains. Of course, outlawing certain language isn’t likely to solve racism. While Bumble and Grindr deny using image recognition-based algorithms to suggest partners visually similar to ones that users have already expressed an interest in, many users suspect that some apps do. (Tinder refused requests to participate in this article, though research shows that Tinder provides potential matches based on “current location, previous swipes, and contacts”.) Barring abusive language could still allow inadvertent prejudice through the efficiency of the apps’ algorithms. “They can’t design out our worst impulses and our worst human conditions,” admits Noble. All dating apps’ algorithms are proprietary black boxes that the companies are wary of sharing with the public or competitors. But if they include some requirement of user self-definition by race (as Grindr does), or preference for interracial relationships (as sites such as OkCupid do), then with every swipe or button press the matchmaking algorithm is learning what we like and what we don’t. Likewise, Tinder’s algorithm ranks attractiveness based on previous swipes; therefore, it promotes what is considered “traditionally” beautiful (read: white) people. Crucially, no app is likely to deliberately dumb down its algorithm to produce worse matches, even if it may help prevent racist behaviour. Bumble hopes to change user behaviour by example. “Whether it’s subconscious or unintentional, lots of people in the world are ingrained with racist, sexist or misogynistic behaviour patterns,” says Troen, adding that “we are more than happy to ban people”. (Bumble has banned “probably a couple of thousand” users for abusive behaviour of one type or another.) Grindr’s head of communications, Landen Zumwalt, accepts that they have been slow to take action. “We have a new suite of queer leadership who only recently joined Grindr and came in with the priority to address this,” he says. Zumwalt joined the company in June; he himself has been a Grindr user, and so has “an understanding of the level of toxicity” taking place on the app. “I knew just how bad things had been, especially for our queer users of colour, and we have a responsibility to be a bit more aggressive in how we create a more respectful area for our users.” Grindr’s decision has been applauded by some, but is undercut by the fact it is still possible to filter out entire ethnicities. “I’m a paying user. They need to create a level playing field,” says Keodara. “Why should I pay for my own oppression? If I’m paying $14.99 every month, why should I have to be subjected to this demeaning, degrading and undignified BS.” Leeds Beckett University’s Jankowski agrees. “It’s facilitating and encouraging racism. There’s no reason why you’d need that.” Zumwalt said Grindr had carefully discussed removing the ethnicity filter, but were hesitant to get rid of it. “We decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,” he says. “While I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.” Bumble’s Louise Troen also refuses to rule out that its app – a women-centric dating service – would not extend its recently-introduced “badges” feature (which allows users to filter by star sign and height) to add a badge for race. “There are no plans in the works to include or add a badge to do with race, but it’s a fundamental company policy that we don’t comment on where the product will be in a year, because we just don’t know.” There has been a backlash to Grindr’s announcement that it will be cracking down on people voicing a preference for one race over others. But to Keodara, the arguments against the decision are problematic. “A lot of people say this is preference,” he says. “But just because it’s preference, it doesn’t mean it’s right. Slavery was white people’s preference.”"

          "headline": "Are automated email responses a good idea? Let me get back to you on that!",
          "bodyText": "Last week I got an email from my boss about a recent piece I’d written on Donald Trump’s penis (just out here doing the family name proud). Surprisingly, it was a kind email as opposed to a notification of the termination of my employment for besmirching the paper of CP Scott with wisecracks about Trump’s junk, but, kind or otherwise, I’ve never known how to respond to messages from my editors. The informality of the email form clashes with my natural instinct, which is – as New Yorker writer Anthony Lane once wrote of his former editor Tina Brown – to stand to attention every time they call me on the phone. Is email the internet equivalent of going out for drinks with someone after work? Are you expected to be casual with each other in a way you aren’t in the office? Or should I express myself in a way that reflects my true feelings? “Dear Boss, I humbly thank you. Really sorry about all the dick jokes. Respectfully yours, Hadley K Freeman.” After more than 20 years of using email, I have not figured this out. Unexpectedly, at the bottom of this email, Google itself stepped in to help me. Beneath my boss’s message were three suggested responses: “Love it!” “Haha that’s awesome!” “That’s a good one!” Turns out “respectfully yours” is just not very Silicon Valley 2018. Once I’d recovered from the hernia caused by laughing for 72 hours at Google’s noble effort to make me sound like a fembot (“Haha, that’s a good one, Hadley!”), I investigated what was going on here. It turned out that my Gmail had updated itself, which is kind of creepy in itself, though not nearly as creepy as its suggested responses, a feature Google has dubbed “Smart Reply” and what I dub “Hell”. Smart Reply is conclusive proof that Google does, as we already kinda knew, read our emails; now it has decided it can answer them better than we do. No need to read any sci-fi books about the dystopian future, kids, because we’re already here. Love it! I could talk about how furious I am about this bizarrely open disregard of privacy (though in today’s world, the only thing that marks one out as more of an oldster than starting an email with “Dear” are concerns about privacy) because, sure, of course I am. But I have to be honest: I enjoy the banality of these automated answers, so much so that I’ve started reading them before the actual emails. When my mother wrote to ask if we were meeting up over the weekend, the suggested responses were “Let me get back to you on that!” “Amazing!” and “No way!” For the record, Google, if I ever replied “Let me get back to you on that!” to my mother, she would call the police to say my body had been possessed by an alien. These responses confirm something anyone who’s ever been on social media already knows: online, there is no middle ground. Everything is either “Amazing!” or “No way!” Meanwhile the exclamation mark continues its deadening march to become as ubiquitous as the “x” for kiss: a once almost ironic stylistic extra that was strictly reserved for close friends is now the downright, earnest norm. I think what tickles me most about these suggested replies is the way they lay bare some of the most irksome elements of our age. Most of us have become inured to the point of obliviousness to those jarring, algorithm-driven adverts, all faux chumminess mixed with creepy surveillance, topped off with spectacularly unhelpful help: “Hey! We noticed you once bought a red coat! Here are some other red coats! To add to your red coat collection! We’re just being helpful!” It also speaks to some of the weird disjuncts within Silicon Valley itself: these days, Facebook pretty much only exists so that people can post photos of their adorable kids, and its major players, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, talk about the importance of making time for family. And yet, as former Facebook employee Eliza Khuner recently wrote, Facebook refused to allow her to work part-time or partly from home after she had her baby, because it would “put too much strain on the team”. Similarly, Jeff Bezos makes a big hoo-ha about how he’s all about helping homeless families these days with his not-for-profit schools, while his company still refuses to pay taxes, or pay many of his workers a living wage. The words, shall we say, do not match the actions. And there is something of this soulless mentality in Gmail’s Smart Responses. On the one hand, email is supposed to make it easier for all of us to keep in touch. On the other, we are now being urged to outsource that correspondence to an exclamation-happy bot that makes us sound more robot than human. But what do I know? If left to my own devices, I’d still sign letters “Cordially yours”. These automated responses will probably soon be as common as autocorrect spelling, something I also rage against, because it doesn’t allow me to curse without enormous effort. Ducking hell. That’s awesome!"

          "bodyText": "Crystals are the millennial’s religion of choice. And not just because Lena Dunham likes to carry them in her handbag or because trendy skincare brands claim they improve wellbeing; crystals are at the core of technology, they are key to those captivating devices that cause minor panic attacks when lost or dropped. We cradle them in our hands, stare at them more than our loved ones and queue for hours to get the next coveted model. Crystal obsession is not a new phenomenon. For generations people have collected them and marvelled at their shapes and shine; mystics have gazed into crystal balls and the study of crystal formation was central to understanding DNA. Site Gallery in Sheffield explores all of these avenues in its exhibition Liquid Crystal Display. Starting by acknowledging our current reliance on crystals, the exhibition delves into the technology and spirituality that surrounds these shimmering stones in a group show that is half art appreciation and half science lesson. It is the first exhibition at Site Gallery following a £1.7m renovation project that saw the venue close for 18 months. The new building is not only three times the size of the original space, but bright and streamlined, with a welcoming cafe at one end and a gigantic, double-height exhibition space at the other. The old exhibition room has been transformed into a project space for smaller presentations, events, activities and artistic experimentation. Curators Laura Sillars and Angelica Sule had the difficult task of filling this giant, empty box in an engaging way. They commissioned artist Anna Barham to create a structure that housed the other 19 artworks, akin to a cabinet of curiosities. Just as crystals form through the repetition of a rule or algorithm, Barham designed her Crystal Fabric Field around a bracket that would define all the possible forms the structure could take. The final work is a maze of brown MDF boards, fluorescent geometric brackets and corrugated plastic. It’s crevices and corners hold hold photography, video, sculpture and drawing. The journey through Barham’s hexagonal shape is mesmerising. Beginning with Jennifer West’s Spiral of Time Documentary Film where the film has been distorted by interactions with crystals, we see our reflection in Eva Rothschild’s dark and clear crystal balls, hear electrical currents being conducted through silicon carbide in Ralf Baecker’s Crystal Set and marvel at the dazzling colours of minerals under the microscope in Waad AlBawardi’s The Hidden Life of Crystals. Sheffield is referred to in the display of Victorian critic John Ruskin’s mineral collection and in the selection of Blue John crystals from the local area. Living in Sheffield, Ruskin was concerned with the poor living conditions of the working people and set up a gallery full of artworks, books and crystals to inspire. The lasting allure of those twinkling minerals is evidenced in their presence here, out of the archive, entertaining a whole new generation of people. But besides the moments of pure wonderment, the more complex scientific concepts are harder to find without detailed curatorial guidance. None of the works have descriptions, so the only way to fully understand them is by buying the catalogue. A passerby might whizz round the gallery, see nothing more than a few rocks in a dark room, and get straight back to staring at that beautiful liquid crystal display on their smartphone. • Liquid Crystal Display is at Site Gallery, Sheffield, until 27 January."

          "bodyText": "Recently, my boyfriend and I toasted our seven-year relationship. That includes six years of cohabiting, one year of pet parenthood and – because we’re old romantics – four years of a shared Amazon Prime account. (“Do you take this man, to have and to hold, and destroy your ‘you might like’ algorithm with football books?”) It’s called true love, and it’s worth celebrating. But the question is, when? If you’re not married, which day do you commemorate: the day you met? The date of your first kiss? Or perhaps the day you exchanged those three precious little words: “I deleted Tinder”? It’s possible to choose wrongly. I learned this the hard way with my last boyfriend. It was a relationship that developed over many years, with no official beginning. So we agreed that meeting my family would become our beginning, the day we’d post on social media each year (#3YearsToday!) and make 20% of our friends post vomit emojis. But I was forgetting Auntie B. It’s not that Auntie B had a specific problem with me having a boyfriend; she just didn’t understand it as a concept. The expression on her face when I tried to explain that I was seeing someone and it was serious – but we were not considering marriage – was like my reading aloud a very long mathematical problem that she was trying to solve in real-time. She just looked confused. “So he is your friend?” she said, eventually. “No, he is my boyfriend. I love him.” “So you’re getting married?” “Not getting married. Absolutely not. Not even thinking about it.” “... So he is your friend?” And so on, until eventually she slinked off. In that moment Auntie B had made a decision to relegate my boyfriend to the friend zone, and therefore “not relevant”. After that, any time I told her news of him she’d treat it the same way as my telling her news about the bloke who sells tyres a few roads down. (“OK?” she’d reply, looking baffled.) The proper meeting went spectacularly: Auntie B set the tone by mistaking my boyfriend for the Freeview repair man and fell asleep midway through the afternoon. But still, I learned a valuable lesson. If traditions don’t work, make your own. Have three anniversaries and mark all the memories, or forget them all and toast only the present. It’s how life should be: a choose-your-own adventure. That’s the kind of adulthood I can get behind."

          "headline": "'Propaganda of privilege': how Labour went to war with the media",
          "bodyText": "In 2013 the then Labour leader Ed Miliband chose to launch a direct attack on the Daily Mail after it accused his father, the socialist academic Ralph Miliband, of hating Britain – a move seen as dangerous by some Labour advisers, with the party still fearful of the power of rightwing tabloids. Half a decade later, Jeremy Corbyn used his speech at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool to launch a direct attack on the British media, winning loud applause for his criticism that “a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful”. He also called on Labour activists to use social media networks – which he termed the mass media of the 21st century – to challenge British newspapers’ “propaganda of privilege”, aided by his team’s belief that attacks on Corbyn by the rightwing press increasingly helped – rather than hindered – the Labour leader. Corbyn was not alone on this. The Unite boss, Len McCluskey, seen walking around the conference hall with a copy of Morning Star, told activists he would not listen to the “professional racists at the Daily Mail and the Sun”. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also started his speech with an attack on “our friends in the media”. Delegates refused to take free copies of the Times on the basis it was owned by Rupert Murdoch. It all demonstrated the extent to which trust in much of the mainstream British press was now at a low point among Labour activists. The potential of a Corbyn-led government was also forcing the media industry to take seriously proposals from party activists, which until recently were on the fringes of media academia. “We are on the brink of government and are going to have to lay the groundwork for the next historical phase for reform of the media,” said Tom Mills, a sociology lecturer at the University of Aston who has held informal discussions with members of Corbyn’s team about press reform. Speakers, during an event at the parallel Momentum-backed The World Transformed (TWT) fringe festival, proposed a series of ideas which would have been considered extreme only a few years ago, such as publicly funded regional news cooperatives with editors elected by the public to produce local journalism. Angela Phillips, a journalism professor at the University of Goldsmiths, also warned of the challenges posed by the influence of Facebook and Google and called for a new approach, given many new leftwing news outlets were reliant on distribution through such sites. “The way forward is to start cooperating across Europe by providing a new search engine based on public service ideas of what an algorithm should be,” she said. Other ideas raised at TWT included a national voucher-based system for funding media, with every voter allocating their voucher to a favoured news outlet, and the ultimate aim of abolishing advertising in the media to avoid the incentive to create articles that only appealed to wealthy readers. Whether any of this comes close to being incorporated into Labour policy could rely on which of the party’s two media policy power bases gets the upper hand. Last month Corbyn himself unveiled a range of policies – largely developed within the leader’s office – including a tax on big tech firms to fund the BBC and elections to the broadcaster’s governing boards. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, who also holds the shadow culture secretary job and has campaigned on media issues for a decade, has adopted an approach that fits more with reform of the existing industry through a focus on regulation of tech companies, campaigns for greater diversity in journalism, and a public inquiry into online political advertising during the Brexit referendum. What has changed recently was that rightwing media outlets were having to take Corbyn’s ideas seriously. News UK employees have been privately concerned that Corbyn’s proposed reforms could go further – with fears that an incoming Labour government could choose to heavily restrict the foreign ownership of newspapers, in an effective block on US citizen Rupert Murdoch. They are already used to being excluded from Labour-related events: the Sun was blocked from covering TWT due to its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster; while employees of the newspaper stayed away from the annual Labour party v journalists conference football match because the pitch was owned by Liverpool council. The Labour leader also showed his attitude to the media by simply skipping much of the press round, which usually accompanied a party conference speech, such as a traditional interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Newspaper reporters learned the hard way about how they were now perceived by the party – their desks at the conference were situated outside the main building, in a tent in a car park accessed by following signs for a “dog exercise area”. By contrast, Theresa May appeared to be making a pitch for herself as champion of the free press. The prime minister told the UN in New York on Wednesday: “I do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me. But I will defend their right to say it – for the independence of our media is one of my country’s greatest achievements. And it is the bedrock of our democracy.”"

          "headline": "UK newspaper industry demands levy on tech firms",
          "bodyText": "The British newspaper industry’s trade body has said the government should force social media sites such as Facebook and Google to pay an annual financial levy to fund journalism, and set up a regulator that would force them to take legal responsibility for all the content on their platforms. The News Media Association, the umbrella group that represents almost all national and local newspapers, including the Guardian, also said Facebook should share revenue with newspaper groups when their stories appear in newsfeeds – even if users only see the headlines and do not click. It also called on the government to introduce a tax credit system, similar to that used to encourage investment in the British film industry, which would allow newspapers to claim a cash rebate for investment in areas such as investigative journalism. Other ideas include forcing social media businesses to promote “bona fide” news sources that meet certain quality criteria, such as “consistent quality” of journalism – potentially prioritising material from more established news sources at the expense of new entrants. The organisation made the proposals in its response to a government-backed review of the future of the British media industry, chaired by the economist Dame Frances Cairncross, which is attempting to find a future for sustainable high-quality journalism in the UK. “The primary focus of concern today is the loss of advertising revenues which have previously sustained quality national and local journalism, and are now flowing to the global search engines and social media companies who make no meaningful contribution to the cost of producing the original content from which they so richly benefit,” said a spokesperson for the NMA. The suggestions from the British newspaper industry, which has seen its revenue halve from £6.8bn in 2007 to £3.6bn in 2017, come as the government considers proposals for a standalone internet regulator following a series of social media scandals. A new regulator could be unveiled by the end of the year. Traditional news outlets have a difficult relationship with Facebook and Google, which they blame for sucking away valuable ad revenue. While they are desperately seeking to rein in the power of the two companies, they also find themselves increasingly reliant on them to drive readers to their websites. When Spain attempted to force Google to pay publishers in 2014, the tech firm responded by simply shutting down Google News in the country. With that in mind, the NMA also called for tech companies “to give reasonable notice of any changes to terms of business or to algorithms which impact news publishers”. Tweaks to Facebook’s secretive algorithm, which decide which content is seen by users, can upend the news business by dramatically increasing or decreasing the traffic sent to a website depending on the type of content produced. The NMA also said problems facing the newspaper industry are fundamentally about a collapse in revenue rather than a collapse in the appetite for their material, saying that the popularity of the free BBC News website meant most Britons expect to get their online news for free. Radical ideas for reform of the British news industry are becoming more widespread as its financial decline becomes more apparent. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has already pledged a levy on tech firms to fund the BBC. Facebook has insisted it is working to prioritise more trusted news sources following criticism of its role in the spread of false information, although popular viral publishers still dominate its most-shared list. Google has often pointed to its investment in the Google News Initiative, which hands out millions of pounds to publishers, although critics have suggested the funds are not enough to make up for lost ad revenue. Impress, the official recognised press regulator, which does not regulate any major publications, also submitted its findings to the review and backed tax benefits for publishers and an equivalent to charitable status for publishers of high-quality journalism."

          "bodyText": "The Turner prize exhibition opens to the public this week with four films addressing issues that include police brutality, human rights abuses and queer identity. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, said it was the most political exhibition in its history. “It feels like a Turner prize that is very much of our times. I just think this is an incredibly political moment on all levels, in Europe, in America and many regions of the world. So the Turner prize brings all that home,” he said. It is also the first Turner prize show to feature works that are all films, with visitors entering a large room with soft chairs, off which there are four dark entrances to the films. The competition was created 34 years ago and regularly upsets traditionalists in the debate about what can be defined as art. This year, jurors have been drawn to serious, political artists. With one work entitled Volume Eleven (A Flaw in the Algorithm of Cosmopolitanism), it is not for people who want a quick scoot around some pretty things. One of the contenders even stretches the definition of what an artist is. Forensic Architecture investigates international crime and injustice and is a collective of architects, film-makers, archaeologists, investigative journalists, lawyers and scientists. It is exhibiting its investigations surrounding the Bedouin population in the Naqab/Negev region of southern Israel – specifically, the events of 18 January 2017, when an attempt by police to clear an unrecognised village resulted in the deaths of two people. Naeem Mohaiemen is showing works including a fictional film, Tripoli Cancelled, which follows the daily routine of a man who spends a decade alone living in an abandoned airport. Charlotte Prodger is showing her autobiographical queer identity film Bridgit, which she made on her iPhone over the course of a year. The fourth artist, Luke Willis Thompson, is showing three works on 35mm film. Some might accuse this year’s Turner prize of being heavy going but Farquharson said there was humour to be found. He pointed to Tripoli Cancelled depicting “a crazy Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare, which in itself is funny and absurd”. Farquharson said: “What is remarkable is that so many different languages of film making are represented.” The prize changed its rules in 2017 to allow any artist working in the UK to be eligible and removed the upper age restriction of 50. That permitted Lubaina Himid, then 63, to become the oldest winner in the prize’s history in December. This year’s exhibition opens at Tate Britain on Wednesday. The £25,000 winner will be named on 4 December at a ceremony broadcast live on the BBC. • The Turner prize 2018 runs from 26 September until 6 January."

          "bodyText": "I spend three hours a day commuting: how do I best use this time? I love a commute. It’s rare “me-time” that allows you to do whatever you want, but I’ve realised that different modes of transport, times of day and routes call for very different pastimes. If I’m travelling cross-country and manage to get a table seat on a train, the first thing I do is go through all my emails and tee up replies. Don’t attempt to use the train wifi – you’ll waste half the journey trying to connect. Open your laptop or phone, and start drafting all your emails. Not only will you go into work with a clear head and plate, but you’ll get a little dopamine hit when you hear the multiple whooshes of emails flying off when you do connect to your office wifi. If working that early in the morning isn’t your thing, then read. Take a slim volume you can fit into your bag or pocket and whip it out when the time gods bless you with 10 minutes. I got into the terrible habit of not reading on short tube journeys, when you can get through quite a few pages and thoughts (even on my nine-minute tube commute in London). I love the Penguin Great Ideas series for little books of big ideas that get my mind ticking before I start my day. If your commute is on a packed bus or train with little space, I recommend long-form podcasts or playlists. Spotify has the best algorithm of all streaming services. I start with one song and let the radio decide what’s next. With podcasts, I tend to choose ones that are at least an hour and flip between startup advice or things unrelated to my work, such as a series on an imaginary mission to Mars (Anatomy Of Next). Three hours a day is enough to do a part-time degree, learn a language or write a novel; you have the freedom to decide how to use your most precious asset.

          "bodyText": "In the summer of 1995, a second-year grad student called Sergey Brin was giving a tour of Stanford University to prospective students. Larry Page, an engineering graduate from the University of Michigan, was one of those being shown around the Palo Alto, California campus. “I thought he was pretty obnoxious,” Larry Page said of the encounter. “He had really strong opinions about things, and I guess I did, too.” “We both found each other obnoxious,” said Sergey Brin. “But we say it a little bit jokingly. Obviously we spent a lot of time talking to each other, so there was something there The technology of the web at the time meant that you could tell where a webpage links to just by reading its code; but the only way to find out where it is linked from is to see it linked to from another page. In other words, to get an exhaustive list of every page that links to, say, stanford.edu, you need to check every other website on the internet. Page’s “Backrub” project aimed to qualify these backlinks, a complex task that not only demanded huge computing resources, but also required extremely complex mathematics, which is where the maths prodigy Brin came in. In 1996 they began experimenting with the Stanford homepage and soon came up with the PageRank algorithm – a ranking system which would prove to be Page and Brin’s breakthrough idea. The algorithm was devised to give more weight to links that came from more authoritative pages – the more backlinks a site had, the more likely it was to be a good source, similar to an academic paper. That allowed Page and Brin to rank search results not only by keyword frequency but by authority. And because the system analysed links, the more the web grew the better Backrub got. In August 1996, Backrub became Google, a play on the term googol, meaning the large number 10 to the power of 100. The first version appeared on the Stanford site, run from cobbled-together bits of computers scavenged by Page and Brin. The system demanded so much bandwidth it would regularly take down the whole of Stanford’s internet connection, but it succeeded in letting users search all 24m pages it had stored in its database. On 15 September 1997 Google.com was registered and by August 1998 the first Google Doodle appeared – a Burning Man figure that was intended to let everyone know that both Page and Brin were at the festival in the Nevada desert. Google also got its first funding in the form of a cheque for $100,000 written by Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in August 1998 to “Google Inc”. The trouble was that Google Inc didn’t exist yet, so after a rush to get the paperwork lined up Google was incorporated on 4 September 1998 so the pair could bank the cheque. Later that month the duo moved out of their dorm rooms and into the garage of friend Susan Wojcicki (now CEO of YouTube) in Menlo Park, California, complete with ping-pong table and bright blue carpet, receiving further investment from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among others. Early in 1999, Page and Brin attempted to sell Google to Excite, then number two search engine behind Yahoo, for $1m, but even after the pair had been talked down to $750,000 by Excite venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Excite CEO George Bell rejected them - although why he did remained a matter of debate for years. Page and Brin had also reportedly attempted to sell their technology to then search engine Altavista and Yahoo in 1998 to no avail. With no buyer in sight, Google started hiring engineers and moved out of the garage to an office in Palo Alto in March 1999. In 2001, seeking so-called “adult supervision” for the company, Eric Schmidt was hired first as chairman and then CEO, taking over from Page. Schmidt was hired over some 50 other candidates because he had been to Burning Man, but he was tasked with the traditional corporate side of the business, leaving Page and Brin to continue to develop Google’s products and technologies respectively. * * * By the end of its first decade, Google had effectively won the search-engine wars. PageRank had provided it its first major leg-up, letting it offer a better search experience than any of its competitors. To this day, the Google homepage remains clean and sparse, offering nothing more than a logo, search field, and two buttons. But the pivot that saw Google go from dominating a service to dominating an industry occurred when the company realised it needed to go outside its areas of expertise, and began an acquisition spree that would seed its evolution to the global behemoth it is today. Arguably, its most important purchase was YouTube, bought for $1.65bn in stock, then the largest purchase the company had made. Unlike many of Google’s previous acquisitions, where the company bought in technology it couldn’t make itself and threw its corporate weight behind making the resulting product success, YouTube was already a phenomenon, and Google had spent its own resources building a direct competitor, Google Video. But YouTube’s lead was already becoming difficult to compete with. Google was able to build a Flash-based video player in-house, but without the huge array of videos that were already on YouTube, it had no viewers, and with no viewers, there was no reason for anyone else to upload video – a vicious cycle. So Google made a still rare move, and bought, not technology, but users. The purchase price was eye-watering for the time, with the New York Times reporting that it sounded “like a tale from the dotcom bubble”, but the story also contained a more telling quote from Steve Ballmer – then Microsoft’s chief executive. “If you believe it’s the future of television, it’s clearly worth $1.6bn,” Ballmer said. The bet paid off. YouTube’s ad revenue alone was projected to be $4bn this year. What will be the next YouTube in Google’s portfolio? The company seems to think it will come from the world of AI. In 2014, Google bought AI company DeepMind for a reported $500m, augmenting its own AI efforts which had been bundled together into the Google Brain unit. DeepMind has continued to operate largely independently as a research-focused institute, most famous for its AlphaGo AI, which became the first machine to beat a professional player of the ancient Asian boardgame Go in 2016. * * * Regulation, censorship and competition all threaten Google’s crown. The company’s first brush with governmental pressure came when the Chinese government’s internet filters started intermittently blocking Google.com in the year 2000. In 2006 the company decided to officially launch Google.cn, a decision which drew widespread criticism, since with a Chinese website came Chinese web censorship – something that Brin, who was born in the Soviet Union, was vocally uneasy with acceding to. Nonetheless, the censorship lasted until 2010, when Gmail became the target of a cyber-attack that the firm believed was attempting to gather information on Chinese human rights activists. It was recently revealed that the company is running a project, Dragonfly, aimed at producing a newly censored version of its search and news products, ready for a re-entry to China. But it’s not just repressive regimes that have forced Google to toe the line. In Europe and the US, the company has also had to give ground to legislatures, regulators and the judiciary. One of the company’s first areas of conflict was over copyright. Less than three months after Google bought YouTube, it was hit with a lawsuit from US media conglomerate Viacom for copyright infringement, a battle that would rage for seven years. Viacom had a strong case, noting that more than 150,000 clips of its copyrighted shows were available on the video-sharing site. But Viacom’s argument was slightly undercut by the revelation that it had uploaded much of the material itself. “For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there,” YouTube’s chief counsel wrote in 2010. The case was finally settled in March 2014. No money changed hands. Another copyright conflict had potentially larger ramifications. Agence France-Press sued Google in March 2005 for $17.5m for allegedly using its photos and stories on Google News without permission, leading to an arrangement to host various news agency content starting in 2007. That suit was followed by one from the Belgian newspaper group Copiepresse, and complaints from the French and German journalism bodies as well. The rows over Google News have continued, in some form or another, for the past decade, and Google has been forced into many concessions: paying licensing fees in some countries, settling out of court in others, and creating charitable funds to support journalism elsewhere. But while it lost some battles, it won the war, for the simple fact that Google News became too big for publishers to ignore. When, in Germany, Google offered the ability for publishers to remove their content from the search engine, Axel Springer, one of the country’s largest publishing companies, took the chance. It told Google the company would have to pay or cease to run images and snippets of text from Axel publications. Google chose the latter option, and, Axel said, traffic plunged. It bowed out of the fight after just two weeks. The size of Google is undoubtedly a strength in fights like that, but it opens another avenue of attack for regulators: it is, in some areas, a monopoly. That means it has to be very careful about how it wields its power, or it will fall prey to competition regulators. In Europe, that process has already begun, with the commission finding that Google had abused its monopolies in search engines and mobile phone app stores. The company has been fined €6.7bn for those two breaches. Regulations aren’t the only threat on the horizon for Google, though. Amazon is going after Google’s crown jewels: search advertising. Almost 90% of Google’s revenue in the last three months came from advertising, and Amazon could seriously threaten its dominance of online retail if this continues. Facebook has a more fundamental line of attack: it wants to kill the web. A Facebook future is one in which a significant proportion of humanity’s data sits, not on the open web, but on the closed social network. That would cut Google off from the information it can search, index and make available, forcing it into ever more extractive relationships with its own users as data sources instead. Of course, the threats could come from a company which doesn’t even exist yet. Maybe one that’s being founded today, and in 20 years time will be ready to take on Google, just like Google has taken on the legacy stars of its own industry."

          "bodyText": "Early one Sunday morning a month ago, a German carpenter was fatally stabbed in a street fight in Chemnitz in eastern Germany. Little is known about how the brawl started, but rumours rapidly circulated online that the man was defending a woman from sexual assault. Within hours of his death, rumours that his killers were two refugees triggered a violent reaction. For two nights running, thousands of rightwing extremists and sympathisers took to the streets of the city. Shocking videos of demonstrators openly using the Nazi salute (a criminal offence in Germany) and chasing and attacking people of foreign appearance rapidly appeared online. The reverberations of the riots continue to roil German politics and society. They appear to have given a massive boost to the right-wing AfD party, for example, which according to some opinion polls is now in second place in Germany. And last week, Angela Merkel removed the head of the domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maaßen, from his post after he faced criticism for his reaction to anti-immigrant protests in the city of Chemnitz. He had cast doubt on the authenticity of the videos showing dark-skinned people being chased and attacked. What’s going on? How did many Germans become so worked up about a street brawl? This question intrigued Ray Serrato, a Berlin-based digital researcher who first noticed it when his wife’s uncle showed him a YouTube video that claimed the rioters had been Muslim refugees. The video was cheaply produced and uploaded by an obscure fringe group and yet it had had nearly half-a-million views – far more than any legitimate news video of the riots. How was this possible? So Serrato started digging, looking for information on every Chemnitz-related video published on YouTube this year. What he found, according to a New York Times report, is that the platform’s recommendation system consistently directed people toward extremist videos on the riots — then on to far-right videos on other subjects. “Users searching for news on Chemnitz would be sent down a rabbit hole of misinformation and hate. And as interest in Chemnitz grew, it appears, YouTube funnelled many Germans to extremist pages, whose view-counts skyrocketed.” Nobody who knows anything about YouTube will be surprised. Time and again, researchers have discovered that when videos with political or ideological content are uploaded to the platform, YouTube’s “recommender” algorithm will direct viewers to more extremist content after they have watched the first one. Given that most people probably have the autoplay feature left on by default, that means that watching YouTube videos often leads people to extremist sites. Strangely, this doesn’t just hold for political or other types of controversial content. Zeynep Tufekci, a well-known technology commentator, found that videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism, videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons, and so on. “It seems,” she wrote, “as if you are never ‘hardcore’ enough for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. It promotes, recommends and disseminates videos in a manner that appears to constantly up the stakes.” Given its billion or so users, she concluded that “YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalising instruments of the 21st century.” Is this because engineers working for Google (which owns YouTube) have a radicalising or extremist agenda? Unlikely; most software engineers I know are terminally uninterested in politics, which they regard as a hobby for underemployed people with low IQ scores. The key factor is a fiendish combination of machine-learning software and Google’s business model. Google is an advertising company masquerading as a tech giant. It sells our attention to advertisers who are willing to pay for it. So the company’s overriding incentive is keep people watching YouTube for as long as possible. And its recommendation algorithm is informed by research into human psychology, which suggests that people are drawn towards content that is more extreme or incendiary than the video they started with. QED. One of the ironies of the current controversy about Facebook’s malign influence on democracy is that it has diverted attention from Google’s equally destructive properties. Yet one of the things we learned from research into the alt-right infrastructure after Trump’s election is that YouTube plays an absolutely pivotal role in that ecosystem. So if governments really wanted to do something about online extremism (a big “if”, IMHO), then they could offer Google a straightforward deal: change the recommendation algorithm to deprioritise extreme content or we’ll do it for you. What I’m reading John Naughton’s recommendations Self-stealing cars As reported in the Register, some security researchers showed how easy it was to clone the Tesla S keyfob. Apparently, this hole in the self-driving car’s defences has now been patched. Hard-hearted Apple Last week, it made a big deal of putting an ECG monitor into Apple Watch 4, but as Business Insider reported, Apple strangely omitted to mention that another company has for some time been selling a strap for existing Apple watches that does the same thing. More for your megapixel Apple has more than 800 engineers working on improving the iPhone camera. Tech Crunch asked a professional photographer to explain what they’ve been doing."

In popular rhetoric, algorithms are scary artificial intelligence mini-brains, the newfangled way to say that computers will take over the world. But what exactly are they? The word sounds hi-tech, but in fact it’s very old: imported into English, via French and Latin, from the name of the ninth-century Arab mathematician al-Khwarizmi. Originally algorithm simply meant what is now called the “Arabic” system of numbers (including zero). Only later did it acquire the more specific sense in mathematics of a procedure or set of rules: a writer in 1811 called for an algorithm for establishing theorems. To this day, algorithm is still just a fancy name for a set of rules. If this, then that; if that is true, then do this. In finance, especially, the word is often shortened to “algo”, which via “algae” evokes a sense of inexorable biological growth. But perhaps if we thought of algorithms as mere humdrum flowcharts, drawn up by humans, we’d be better able to see where responsibility really lies if, or when, they go wrong."

          "bodyText": "You are right to highlight councils’ use of data about adults and children without their permission, alongside the warped stereotypes that inevitably shape the way families are categorised (Council algorithms use family data to predict child-abuse risk, 17 September). But the problems are more wide-ranging. In policy debates shaped by the Climbié and Baby P scandals, pre-emptive interventions sound attractive, but ethical debates about what level of intervention in family life, on what basis, and how pre-emptively, still need to take place. Such debates would be necessary with accurate predictions but become absolutely crucial when, as with any risk screening programme, false positives are unavoidable. In a given population where the base rate of abuse is low, these errors will be drastically higher than commonly believed. The buzz around big data and artificial intelligence may be leading councils to overlook not only the maths of risk screening but also the quality of their data. Our own research into child protection notes a weak evidence base for interventions, with social workers falling back on crude assumptions. Stereotypes discriminate against some families and lead to the overlooking of risk in other cases, yet may become entrenched and legitimised when incorporated into technology. Research is needed into whether these technologies enhance decision-making or whether they become uncritically relied on by pressured professionals with burgeoning caseloads. Enticed by software-driven solutions, our overstretched and decentralised child-protection system may lack the capacity for a robust ethical and evidence-based reflection on these technologies. Dr Patrick Brown Associate professor, Amsterdam Institute of Social Science Research, University of Amsterdam; editor, Health, Risk and Society • That councils are using predictive algorithms to identify vulnerable families at risk of child maltreatment is neither a good nor bad thing. Some private companies certainly benefit, but we need evidence that this approach does more good than harm for the public. Five questions must be answered to assess whether these predictive models benefit vulnerable families and are cost-effective for cash-strapped councils: First, does the algorithm lead to families receiving an effective intervention that reduces child maltreatment? Evidence is lacking for the Troubled Families programme and there are too few randomised trials in children’s social care to know what works. Second, which vulnerable families lose out on help because they were missed by the algorithm and which families were wrongly identified? Both errors have consequences that must be counted in the net benefits and harms. Third, how well does the algorithm perform compared with alternative approaches for identifying at-risk families? Fourth, the algorithm relies on past practice of identifying families; how accurate was this? Fifth, how can government maintain public trust in services and the use of public data, when councils are applying undisclosed algorithms to public data without our knowledge or consent, for unevaluated interventions, to screen their populations for a problem as serious as child maltreatment? The stakes are high in terms of potential harms. The purported benefits of algorithms must be supported by transparency and robust evidence of benefit. Prof Ruth Gilbert and Rachel Pearson University College London Prof Gene Feder University of Bristol • It is deeply concerning that councils are using algorithms to identify or predict the likelihood of child abuse. Apart from privacy concerns, data subjects are often unaware of the exact nature and accuracy of the data held on them: what actually constitutes “data”? Anyone who has been stalked or innocently fallen foul of a nuisance neighbour knows that false allegations are a weapon of choice. Even when councils are advised accordingly and the allegations categorically proven as false, some refuse to correct or remove inaccurate data for years. With a relatively toothless Data Protection Act, council data subjects (all of us) are now faced with increased worry and little comeback. Also, how do those relying on algorithms reconcile themselves to the fact that their “data” and, therefore, predictions and consequences may be wrong? In a cynical world of cash-strapped councils, if they are incentivised by increased income, one can but question the motives of using this flawed system. If only 80% of predictions are right, what about the 20% that are wrong? Charmaine Fletcher Basildon, Essex • In addition to the poverty of ethics arising from the failure to gain informed consent and the lack of accountability of sponsoring companies, it is highly unlikely in any scientific sense that unrepresentative data from algorithmic profiling can establish causality and predictability. Even large representative data sets such as the Swedish national registers of entire birth cohorts identify “risk factors” – not unproven predictive analytics – in comparing groups of vulnerable young people with the rest of the population. Their methodology has identified the poor school performance of care leavers as “a very high risk factor” of psycho-social problems in adulthood, providing an important international context and focus for improvements in policy and practice – and demonstrating how the use of rigorous quantitative data and professional judgments can complement each other. Prof Mike Stein University of York • Why are cash-strapped councils wasting money on predictive software telling us what we already know? It’s not rocket science. Poverty, addictions, poor health, school exclusions etc, have always been predictors of potential difficulties for children. They should be spending what little money there is on preventive services, Sure Start nurseries, youth clubs and teaching assistants. Tina Shaw St Albans, Hertfordshire • Your editorial (18 September) raises some fundamental questions about the nature of public services and professionals that work in these services. The potential for computerised aided decision-making cannot be ignored. Evidence, judgment and interventions and services need to be driven by the best of what we know, focussed on the needs and circumstances of the people who find themselves in difficulty and trusted and respected what is offered. When it comes to services for children and families, the role of the state is fundamentally defined by article 8 of the European convention on human rights – “the right to respect for one’s private and family life, home and correspondence”. Only when this conflicts with other basic rights does the state have a duty to intervene against the wishes of the individual or family. Child protection is one of these areas and there is a tension between the need to make services available to families– a home, income, food, health and education services – and the option to remove the child against the parent’s wishes if that is the only option to protect them. Social workers barely need algorithms to determine which families need homes, food and clothing. They may need decision-making support in identifying the best long-term plan for the child where this is not sufficient. We have a duty to support every child in every family. There can be no doubt that public policy should be closely aligned to that fundamental objective. My algorithm tells me that at the moment it does not.

          "bodyText": "Between a tenth and a third of the jobs in Britain are at risk of being automated away, depending on which survey or well-informed guess you believe. Should social workers be among them? It might seem that the particular and personal skills of social work are of a nature that could never be replaced by a machine, but from the point of view of an economist they are part of the machinery to provide help in the most cost-effective way. This involves judgment: which families need what kind of help most urgently? And that kind of classification is one of the things that various forms of artificial intelligence promise to do better and more quickly than unaided human beings. It involves the ability to detect significance in a mass of confusing information, often in ways that are hard to explain – a faculty that in humans is called intuition. When computers do it, it is called machine learning. In neither case is it wholly reliable. The augmentation or replacement of social workers with machine learning is the possibility raised by our report that five English councils are trialling software which will help to pick out families and children in need of intervention. It is not the only danger of the projects. There are obvious problems around informed consent: as far back as 2012, Dame Louise Casey took the view that demanding informed consent for the use of the relevant data damaged society as a whole and particularly its most vulnerable members. This is not what the Guardian believes. Nor, after the GDPR, is it what the law allows. Then there is the fallibility of the algorithms themselves: the way in which putting human prejudices into software makes AI “money laundering for bias”. Beyond that is the further danger that even if this function of social workers and other professionals can be successfully augmented by machine learning, that might tend to make all the other things they do look less important when in fact they will become much more so. Yet Ms Casey’s argument has an intuitive force. We are all leaving increasingly large trails of data behind us as we move through life. At the moment it is mostly analysed in order to sell us things more efficiently. It would be absurd for society not to make use of it for more valuable purposes. If informed consent could be obtained from everyone within a council’s area, there are no doubt interesting and useful things that could be discovered. But that kind of analysis would have to involve all citizens. The more data these algorithms have, the better the results will be. Importantly, this must not just be data on “problem” families. We cannot know how they differ from the norm without a great deal of data from the families who will never trouble social work departments. This is unlikely to be politically as popular as the idea of automating hard-pressed social services departments. None of this happens in a vacuum. Technology is not bestowed on us by benevolent gods. It is deployed in response to pre-existing social and economic pressures. Why might local government want to invest in this kind of thing, and why might central government want to believe in it? To ask the question is to answer it. The technology appears to promise a magical way to slip out of the vice of rising costs, demand and expectation on the one side, and shrinking revenues on the other. But there is no magic escape here. In some cases the enthusiastic deployment of technology can make a bad situation very much worse. The good intentions of local councils will only be rewarded if they are properly funded from the centre."

          "bodyText": "When 24-year-old fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted a picture of herself having breakfast, the internet turned nasty. “The best of days start with a smile and positive thoughts. And pancakes. And strawberries. And bottomless tea,” Dixon wrote on her scarlettlondon Instagram feed, under an image of her looking flawless on a freshly made bed flanked by heart-shaped helium balloons. The sponsored post – for Listerine mouthwash, a bottle of which is visible on the side of the shot – was swiftly reposted on Twitter. “Fuck off this is anybody’s normal morning,” wrote Nathan from Cardiff. “Instagram is a ridiculous lie factory made to make us all feel inadequate.” His post, which has garnered more than 111,000 likes (22 times as many as Dixon’s original) and almost 25,000 retweets, prompted a wave of criticism, with the more printable comments ranging from “Fakelife!” and “Bunny-boiler” to “Let’s pop her balloons” and “Who keeps Listerine on their bedside table? Serial killers, that’s who.” That hostility feels par for the course on Twitter. The social network is a notorious hotbed of abusive strangers hurling abuse at other abusive strangers, who then all occasionally come together to bully a celebrity off the internet over some minor failing, such as being a woman in a Star Wars film. Instagram, by contrast, looks like the friendliest social network imaginable. It’s a visually led community where the primary method of interaction is double-tapping an image to like it, where posts that go viral tend to do so because of positivity rather than outrage and where many of the biggest accounts are famous dogs and cats. What’s not to like? But, for a growing number of users – and mental health experts – the very positivity of Instagram is precisely the problem. The site encourages its users to present an upbeat, attractive image that others may find at best misleading and at worse harmful. If Facebook demonstrates that everyone is boring and Twitter proves that everyone is awful, Instagram makes you worry that everyone is perfect – except you. In the days following her initial Instagram post, Dixon pointed out the irony that this fear – that the unreality of social media is harming people – was itself being used to justify the thousands attacking her. “Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post, accompanying a picture of her in Venice with an ice-cream. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.” “My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys. “I personally don’t think my content is harmful to young girls, but I do agree Instagram can present a false expectation for people to live up to.” But whether or not Dixon’s feed is harmful, there is growing support for the idea that Instagram isn’t great for its users’ mental health. In 2017, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), an independent charity that seeks to improve people’s wellbeing, conducted a UK-wide survey of 14- to 24-year-olds, asking them about the big five social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram. Users ranked how their use of the platforms affected everything from the quality of their sleep to their Fomo – the fear of missing out on what others are enjoying. Instagram came last, scoring particularly badly for its effects on sleep, body image and Fomo. Only Snapchat came close in its overall negativity, saved by a more positive effect on real-world relationships, while YouTube scored positively on almost every metric – except its effect on sleep, for which it was the worst of all the platforms. “On the face of it, Instagram can look very friendly,” says the RSPH’s Niamh McDade. “But that endless scrolling without much interaction doesn’t really lead to much of a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. You also don’t really have control over what you’re seeing. And you quite often see images that claim to be showing you reality, yet aren’t. That’s especially damaging to young men and women.” The risk of developing an unhealthy body image is often highlighted, but McDade emphasises that this is just one aspect. “Some people may be looking at feeds full of cars, and it’s giving them anxiety and depression as they can’t afford them.” For Stephen, a 24-year-old from London, the unreality led him to develop unhealthy behaviours online. “I was going through a bit of heartbreak at the time,” he says, “and any experience of seeing my ex’s name on Instagram killed me. I was pretty down and found myself predominantly using Instagram to either ‘punish’ myself by looking at my ex, or using the browse feature to distract me. I found myself looking at attractive women a lot when they’d come up in the browse feature, which would then cause more to be shown. “I was getting to a point where I was feeding an unhealthy habit [of forming a warped view of women] and making myself feel worse.” Stephen then took a year-long break from the app, during which he wrote a dissertation on its harmful effects on wellbeing and body satisfaction. “The problem with Instagram is that you, almost exclusively, share content that is meant to reflect positively on yourself,” he says. “On Twitter or Facebook, you see much more content that isn’t, ‘Hey, look at my great life.’” Almost every user adds fuel to the flames. Even as we’re being made miserable by the unreal lives that we follow, we share an unreal version of our own lives. “I have been on Instagram since 2013 and in the beginning I enjoyed it,” says Adnan, a 25-year-old Syrian who lives in Cape Town. “But, as the years passed, it changed from being a friendly environment, where most people posted food pictures, into a competitive social platform where everyone filters out their lives to represent a life that does not exist. Nobody looks good all the time, nobody is always happy. When things get tough, I get really upset when I see other people having the ‘perfect’ life.” And yet, Adnan says, “I am also guilty of trying to show the best side of my life to people.” But Instagram has always been about looking flawless. What has changed to spark such a backlash? Among users I spoke to, one event was cited time and again: the introduction, in mid-2016, of Instagram’s algorithmic timeline. It was one of the largest changes to the platform since it was bought by Facebook in 2012. Rather than presenting users with a cross-section of what the people they were following were up to at any given moment, Instagram began populating feeds with the most noteworthy posts from those accounts, often reaching back days or even weeks to pull in particularly compelling content. In effect, the service began promoting a curated, unrealistic version of an already curated, unrealistic feed. Talya Stone, a parenting blogger at Motherhood: The Real Deal, went cool on Instagram shortly afterwards. “For a long time, Instagram was one of the only places where the interaction felt real,” she says. “Then the algorithm came along and blew that out of the water. The whole point of these social platforms is that they are supposed to enhance social connectivity – yet, bizarrely, they are based on an algorithm that seems to be working against this very notion.” Victoria Hui, who runs the lifestyle blog the Lust Listt, says there is another issue affecting “pro” Instagram users – those who make a living (or hope to) from advertising and sponsorship. “The new algorithm creates a popularity contest between creators, so that they resort to unethical business decisions in order to keep themselves at the top of the food chain.” Unscrupulous creators started buying followers, likes and comments in an attempt to fool the algorithm; as Instagram clamped down on that, Hui says, those users formed secret “comment pods” conspiring to share “each and every post with each other in order to generate ‘authentic’ and immediate engagement”. While influencers such as Dixon often get the lion’s share of the blame for the epidemic of unreality on Instagram, it’s just as prevalent at the grassroots as it is among the “Insta-celebrities”. I stopped using the app earlier this year, when I realised that I reliably felt worse after opening it than I did before I started. But my Instagram – a locked account, with just a couple of hundred followers and posts – is almost exclusively for keeping in touch with people I got to know in other ways. The closest I get to following influencers is the pop star Carly Rae Jepsen and an Instagram-famous husky. Still, every time I open the app, I’m presented with an endless feed of my friends and family doing incredible things, having a wonderful time, without me. There’s the friend whose wedding I wasn’t invited to; I found out about it through the app. There’s the friend who is looking fantastic after every workout and lets us all know. And there’s the friend who lives in New York, apparently over in London for the weekend without telling me. Meanwhile, I’m doing nothing of note – except sitting on Instagram. At least I don’t suffer the same from the adverts. Because of a glitch in my privacy settings, Instagram believes I am a Bangkok teenager and serves me nothing but adverts written in Thai for acne cures and KFC. This is not a joke. When I tell friends about my dissatisfaction with the app, their responses are mixed. Some cite conventional wisdom, telling me to unfollow the influencers with a commercial imperative to sell me a perfect life and devote the app to keeping up with the friends I care about. Rob, for instance, follows “fewer than 100 people, all family and friends”. But I don’t follow any influencers, and the friends I care about most are the ones most likely to create that familiar pang of Fomo. Others offer exactly the opposite advice, arguing that my problem is not following enough influencers. I should focus less on using Instagram to find out what people I care about are doing and more on using it as a source of information and inspiration. One friend, Lynsey, cites Present and Correct, which sells exquisitely designed office supplies, as her go-to happy place. Another, Marie, recommends her personal mix of “roughly one-third friends, one-third MPs and one-third drag queens”. It’s true that there is a whole world of information best communicated in a visual medium. While some fitness-focused Instagrams leave you feeling like a fat blob of plasticine, others are sources of useful advice, laser-targeted at people in your situation. But I’ve tried that version of Instagram, too, and I worry that it provides only a veneer of engagement, while forever hovering on the precipice of impossibly perfect breakfasts eaten by impossibly perfect people. Even Facebook, Instagram’s owner, warns against using its products in this way. “In general,” the company wrote on its corporate blog last year, “when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information – reading but not interacting with people – they report feeling worse afterward”. Of course, Facebook’s answer was that everyone should post more. But it would say that, wouldn’t it? Another option is to follow the guidance of the RSPH. As part of “scroll-free September” the charity is encouraging users to aim for anything between complete cold turkey and simply stopping at certain times, such as in the bedroom or during meals. There is one final possibility, proposed by a few others when I shared my own Insta-woes: don’t give up on Instagram, just give up on people. There are enough dogs, cats, birds, otters and ferrets to fill a social network of their own – from Jiro the otter to Gotcha the cockatoo – and it’s very hard to scroll through pet Instagram and feel bad about yourself. Though you may start wishing for a more photogenic labradoodle. For more information and advice on issues with social media, go to the RSPH: rsph.org.uk"

          "bodyText": "Robert Jones was driving home through the pretty town of Todmorden, in West Yorkshire, when he noticed the fuel light flashing on the dashboard of his car. He had just a few miles to find a petrol station, which was cutting things rather fine, but thankfully his GPS seemed to have found a short cut – sending him on a narrow winding path up the side of the valley. Robert followed the machine’s instructions, but as he drove, the road got steeper and narrower. After a couple of miles, it turned into a dirt track, but Robert wasn’t fazed. After all, he thought, he had “no reason not to trust the satnav”. Just a short while later, anyone who happened to be looking up from the valley below would have seen the nose of Robert’s BMW appearing over the brink of the cliff above, saved from the 100ft drop only by the flimsy wooden fence at the edge he had just crashed into. “It kept insisting the path was a road,” he told the Halifax Courier after the incident. “So I just trusted it. You don’t expect to be taken nearly over a cliff.” I can imagine Robert was left red-faced by his blunder, but in a way, I think he’s in good company. When it comes to placing blind faith in a piece of software, his mistake was one we’re almost all capable of making. In our urge to automate, in our eagerness to adopt the latest innovations, we appear to have developed a habit of unthinkingly handing over power to machines. All around us, algorithms provide a kind of convenient source of authority: an easy way to delegate responsibility, a short cut we take without thinking. Who is really going to click through to the second page of Google results every time and think critically about the information that has been served up? Or go to every airline to check if a comparison site is listing the cheapest deals? Or get out a ruler and a road map to confirm that their GPS is offering the shortest route? But already in our hospitals, our schools, our shops, our courtrooms and our police stations, artificial intelligence is silently working behind the scenes, feeding on our data and making decisions on our behalf. Sure, this technology has the capacity for enormous social good – it can help us diagnose breast cancer, catch serial killers, avoid plane crashes and, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has proposed, potentially save lives using NHS data and genomics. Unless we know when to trust our own instincts over the output of a piece of software, however, it also brings the potential for disruption, injustice and unfairness. If we permit flawed machines to make life-changing decisions on our behalf – by allowing them to pinpoint a murder suspect, to diagnose a condition or take over the wheel of a car – we have to think carefully about what happens when things go wrong. Back in 2012, a group of 16 Idaho residents with disabilities received some unexpected bad news. The Department of Health and Welfare had just invested in a “budget tool” – a swish piece of software, built by a private company, that automatically calculated their entitlement to state support. It had declared that their care budgets should be slashed by several thousand dollars each, a decision that would put them at serious risk of being institutionalised. The problem was that the budget tool’s logic didn’t seem to make much sense. While this particular group of people had deep cuts to their allowance, others in a similar position actually had their benefits increased by the machine. As far as anyone could tell from the outside, the computer was essentially plucking numbers out of thin air. From the inside, this wasn’t far from the truth. It would take four years and a class-action lawsuit to get to the bottom of what was going on, but when the budget tool was eventually handed over for scrutiny, a hint of what we all have to fear from the unrestricted power of machine decision-making was revealed. The algorithm was junk. The data was riddled with errors. The calculations were so bad that the court would eventually rule its determinations unconstitutional. It had, effectively, been awarding benefits at random. And yet, when dressed up as a slick and glossy new computer programme, the algorithm brought with it an air of authority that was difficult to argue against. In the days before proper regulation of medicines, you used to be able to bottle up any coloured liquid and make a small fortune selling it as a cure-all. Today, in the still largely unfettered world of AI and algorithms, we’re seeing people make bold, unsubstantiated and sometimes irresponsible claims about their inventions. There’s only one way to prevent this. I think it’s time we started treating machines as we would any other source of power. I would like to propose a system of regulation for algorithms, and perhaps a good place to start would be with Tony Benn’s five simple questions, designed for powerful people, but equally applicable to modern AI: “What power have you got? “Where did you get it from? “In whose interests do you use it? “To whom are you accountable? “How do we get rid of you?” Because, ultimately, we can’t just think of algorithms in isolation. We have to think of the failings of the people who design them – and the danger to those they are supposedly designed to serve. • Dr Hannah Fry is a lecturer in the mathematics of cities at University College London.

          "bodyText": "As a profession, economists are absolutely hopeless at forecasting recessions. That is true not only in the years before a severe downturn. It happens when the storm is about to break. Back in 2008, the Bank of England failed to predict the biggest postwar slump in the UK’s history even after it had started. This less than impressive record should act as a cautionary note in the current circumstances when the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers has generated a thriving cottage industry devoted to predicting when the next crisis will occur. The honest answer is that nobody really knows. Meteorology has improved in the past 40 years, economic forecasting has not. When a weather forecaster says a hurricane is imminent, the public does well to take notice. When an economic forecaster gives a similar warning, the chances are that it is already too late. This might be about to change. Just as satellite technology has made weather forecasting far more accurate, so machine-learning algorithms could bring economic forecasting into the 21st century. Rickard Nyman and Paul Ormerod have compared economic forecasting by humans and machines in both the US and the UK, and come up with some stark conclusions. At the start of 2008 the survey of professional forecasters in the US failed to predict that within a year their country would be in a deep recession. Had US policymakers relied on machine-learning algorithms they would have been much better prepared for the trouble ahead. Even more impressive results using machine learning were obtained for the UK. There’s more, however. Nyman and Ormerod sift through all the economic and financial variables that might have been responsible for causing the downturn and come up with a conclusion that explodes the myth that overspending governments were to blame. “The evidence suggests quite clearly that public sector debt played no causal role in generating the Great Recession” they say. “In contrast, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP does appear to have played a significant role, especially in the UK.” In truth, the idea that state profligacy caused the Great Recession has never been credible. What really happened was that the expansion of the global marketplace led to cheap goods flooding the west. Inflationary pressure abated and that persuaded central banks to cut interest rates. Financial deregulation meant the only remaining constraint on excessive borrowing – high interest rates – was removed – and so credit was cheap and readily available. The private sector loaded up on debt, which was fine so long as the assets on the other side of the balance sheet were going up in value. When the markets turned, things went pear-shaped very quickly. Only at that point, did public sector debt become a problem because governments sought to ameliorate the impact of the recession by cutting taxes and increasing spending. The debts incurred by the private sector were, to an extent, nationalised. Bill White, then chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements was one of the very few who sought to prick the bubble of complacency in the boom years, making the point that periods of low inflation could still end in crisis. His warnings were not heeded. The BIS remains concerned about debt levels, which is where the work of Nyman and Ormerod is relevant to the state of the world 10 years after Lehman. Put simply, the cure for the Great Recession was for central banks to slash interest rates and to increase the supply of money by buying bonds from the private sector in the process known as quantitative easing. Debt levels in the private sector fell for a while as households and companies retrenched but have subsequently started rising again. Low interest rates were designed to provide incentives for investors to seek out riskier assets, which is what they have done. Money has flooded into emerging markets, where yields are juicier because the risks are higher. Turkey, where the central bank raised interest rates to 24% last week, is one example of what can happen in a world of footloose capital. Speculative money comes in from abroad. It finances a construction boom and drives up the exchange rate. Eventually, the trade deficit starts to balloon and inflation starts to rise. At that point, the speculators take fright and the exodus of capital triggers a fall in the exchange rate. At that point, the central bank has to raise interest rates to punitive levels to defend the currency and recession becomes inevitable. The BIS says in its latest annual report that there are already material risks to financial stability. “In some respects, the risks mirror the unbalanced post-crisis recovery and its excessive reliance on monetary policy. Where financial vulnerabilities exist, they have been building up, in their usual gradual and persistent way. More generally, financial markets are overstretched … and we have seen a continuous rise in the global stock of debt, private plus public, in relation to GDP. This has extended a trend that goes back to well before the crisis and that has coincided with a long-term decline in interest rates.” Behind the dry official language, the message is clear. A recovery that is based around high and rising levels of debt is really no recovery at all. The world economy is, in all material respects, the same as it was in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The necessary reforms to a flawed model have not taken place, which is why the BIS warning should not be ignored. While it is not possible to say when the next recession will arrive, or where it will start, history is repeating itself. And you don’t need a machine learning-algorithm to know there are dangers involved in that."

          "bodyText": "Who do you turn to when you can’t decide what to wear? Your best friend, maybe. Instagram, probably. People like me and magazines like this one (hopefully). But soon, perhaps, it will be none of the above. Instead, you will try on an outfit, turn to a wall-mounted, five megapixel camera with front lighting and dual-antennae wifi connectivity, ask, “Alexa, how do I look?” and within a few seconds the 1.6 watt speaker will deliver the data-driven, empirically-founded assessment. The Echo Look is Amazon’s first “style assistant”, recently rolled out across the US after an invite-only soft launch. No UK launch date is set, but the technology – which analyses your outfit through a combination of algorithms and (human) “fashion specialists” – is set to revolutionise what technology means to style. Just four years ago, the cutting edge of technology in fashion was Tommy Hilfiger’s solar-powered phone-charging jacket. Horse-and-cart stuff, compared with what is going to happen to fashion next. The real point of fashion isn’t the fabric or the clothes themselves; it is how we think and feel about those clothes. And it is this human, emotional part of fashion – style, if you like – on which artificial intelligence now sets its sights. Stitch Fix is a online personal styling service which sends its 2.7 million active American clients suggestion boxes of clothes chosen by cross-referencing a client’s stated preferences with the recent purchases of others of similar age and demographic. Matchesfashion.com is experimenting with personalised 3D avatars that will be able to “try on” digital samples so that you can see how the shape and size will work on your body. Net-a-Porter is trialling technology that scans your data for information on forthcoming trips and events, and tailors its suggestions accordingly. But can there really be an algorithm for style? Surely not. In 2003, Kate Moss found a lemon-yellow 50s chiffon dress in Lily et Cie, a vintage store in Beverly Hills, and wore it to a dinner at New York fashion week, where the entire room fell in love with it and a million copycat versions were born. The dress wasn’t in keeping with that season’s catwalk trends, or colours, but it was somehow absolutely right for that moment. I was there, the dress remains seared on my retina to this day, and it felt like serendipity, like magic. How would an algorithm replace the je ne sais quoi of Kate Moss? Or Jane Birkin in the south of France with Serge, or Bianca Jagger at Studio 54? This is a quantum leap from the frying pan you bought last month that’s still following you around the internet. The metric of a style algorithm based on likes, whether fed to you as feedback on your selfies or as a subscription box of suggested autumn clothes, will steer you towards a polished, palatable, mainstream look. “If the algorithm is based on mass approval, it is not going to propose you wear a weird top with one sleeve,” says Alistair O’Neill, professor of fashion at Central St Martins. “It’s going to knock the edges off your preferences and guide you towards an aesthetic that is sort of ambient.” Early users of the Echo Look reported that it scored navy and muted colours higher than brighter shades, and gave the thumbs up to Instagram-approved styling accents such as popped collars and rolled-up shirtsleeves. In the 21st century, technology is defining our taste. Ten years after its launch, Airbnb is not just a platform to rent somewhere to stay, but a silent tastemaker which has drawn a template for how a desirable home should look. White or bright accent walls, raw wood, Nespresso machines, Eames chairs, patterned rugs on bare floors, open shelving, Scandi-chic, the industrial look, and a minimal version of mid-century were characteristics that Kyle Chayka identified as the Airbnb “look” two years ago. Standardisation evolved organically, as would-be hosts copied the look of the most popular spaces on the site. And then renters taken by the bare Edison lightbulbs and gallery walls of black and white photography in homes they stayed in while on holiday began to bring the look into their own homes. It is easy to imagine a similar process taking place in our wardrobes, once facsimile style advice is being beamed into each of our homes. That would be less an algorithm for style than an algorithm for killing off style, though. “You only have to look at the interest in the V&amp;A’s show about Frida Kahlo this year to see that people really value style as a form of self-creation,” O’Neill says. The subversive, iconoclastic, individual aspect of fashion is important not just to its cultural weight, but to its commercial clout. The power of fashion to make us spend is strongest not when we are presented with another version of the type of pencil skirt we already have and like, but the moment when we see, say, a kilt, and realise that, despite never having wanted one before, we simply have to have one right away. “Fashion needs audacity,” says Simon Doonan, fashion writer and consultant. “Look at what has happened at Gucci, which Alessandro Michele has reinvented. When he took over, Gucci was quite conservative. If he had tested his crazy ideas against the data about what Gucci clients were buying, there would have been smoke coming out of the computer. And yet somehow it worked. It was his gut instinct and for whatever reason the powers that be were brave enough to go along with it. And here I am now, standing here talking to you wearing silk Gucci slippers with cats embroidered on them.” But perhaps the style algorithms of the future could be programmed to surprise. Brad Klingenberg, vice-president of data science at Stitch Fix, states that the aim is to “delight” clients, rather than just please them, suggesting an element of the unexpected. (Stitch Fix, like the Echo Look, is currently guided by people as well as data. “We rely on our human stylists to empathise with clients. For example, when a client writes in to her stylists that she needs something to wear to her ex-boyfriend’s wedding, only a human can understand the gravitas of that request,” Klingenberg says.) To futurists such as Sophie Hackford, we are wrong to romanticise the way fashion works now. “Online shopping as we know it is a lousy experience, because you are essentially looking at an inventory. One day in the future you will be sitting on your sofa next to a virtual Diana Vreeland, or Alexa Chung, who will be talking you through the selection of virtual clothes you can see being modelled in front of you, and it will seem so funny that we once scrolled through two-dimensional skirts on the internet,” she says. Retailers are already experimenting with incorporating data from your calendar – about a future trip, and what the weather forecast is for that location, for instance – into what gets served up as cookies. Artificial intelligence could sprinkle fairy dust on the online shopping experience, so that instead of scrolling through a hundred skirts, you are matched with one you fall in love with. Sandrine Deveaux of ecommerce unicorn Farfetch is working on a “Store of the Future” which hopes to seize the momentum with a new, better customer experience. “The entire industry is focused right now on what the consumer-facing aspect of AI in retail will be. It has to be something meaningful.” The robots are not necessarily the bad guys. Artificial intelligence could hold the key to making fashion more sustainable. “We are producing too much clothing and throwing away too much clothing,” says Matthew Drinkwater, head of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion. “The retail model needs to change. AI makes it possible to adjust manufacture in real time, responding to customer design as it happens, so that waste is minimised.” The opportunities for personalisation – from monograms to bespoke tailoring using 3D measurements taken online – hold the promise of clothes that we will value more, and wear for longer. And there’s more. An artificial intelligence takeover of the power traditionally held by the population of magazine mastheads and the fashion week front row to anoint the “best-dressed” could bring about a democratic revolution in an elitist industry. That the industry is still riven with snobbery and unconscious bias – or worse – about skin colour and body shape is evidenced by the way so-called “streetstyle” galleries on fashion websites, and the upper echelons of the “influencer” world, are dominated by thin white women. Algorithms could be used to avoid the bias and snobberies that hold fashion back. The streetstyle photos selected for magazine websites, for instance, tend to follow a very specific seasonally-ordained look. Machines programmed by humans are known to have their own biases, but an algorithm – programmed into CCTV in cities around the world – might one day do a better job of finding interesting-looking people. At the heart of our unease about artificial intelligence – not unique to fashion – is a disquiet about the changing power dynamic between human intelligence and the artificial kind. We sense the robots creeping up on us, we imagine them breathing down our necks (unlikely, what with them having no need of respiration, but still) and we worry about how we will compete. And the more artificial intelligence advances into those areas of our thinking that we experience as creative and emotional, the more spooked we get. Artificial intelligence already guides your car the fastest route home; it probably won’t be long until that mapping app communicates with your home hub to put the kettle, music and lights on for your arrival, just like your partner or flatmate might do. That is intelligence, but it will feel a lot like affection, which we think of as a human-to-human interaction. In the same way, algorithms that know your spending power and established habits already manipulate what you will see if you search online for, say, white trainers. But if one day soon you get dressed in the morning and your phone beeps to tell you that your look is lame, what will that feel like? Cyberbullying? Not so long as we programme the robots to be kind, Doonan says. “I personally don’t like the idea that there’s a right or wrong way to dress. I have a Moschino jacket that says on the back ‘Good Taste Does Not Exist’ and I believe that. But the reality is that many people are very insecure about how they look and they want stuff to wear that helps them feel confident. When I talk to customers at Barneys about how they decide what to wear, a phrase that comes up a lot – particularly among men – is the need to ‘get it right’. So I am sympathetic to some kind of mechanism that reduces anxiety.” Perhaps, anyway, we are more like the robots than we like think. “The majority of people have already developed an algorithm for style, even if they don’t think of it like that,” says Simon Lock, founder and CEO of Ordre, which offers fashion buyers a digital, streamlined alternative to physical showrooms. “For instance, I wear black and white, a slim fit silhouette, always Thom Browne brogues. Essentially, the eye captures a look and the brain informs the wearer whether you like it or not based on history and personal taste. Artificial intelligence is perfectly suited to perform this role for us.” Today’s teenagers have an ever more porous boundary between their IRL and online selves, with relationships – even romantic ones – sometimes conducted entirely via phones. (FaceTime, but not face time.) They have developed what Bia Bezamat, innovation editor at online news site TheCurrent, calls a “hybrid identity”. And it’s not just gamers and kids who have avatars. Isn’t the Instagram or Facebook version of yourself – the one who has more covetable holidays, better behaved children and sassier one-liners than actual you – a kind of avatar, too? The boundaries will blur even more, the futurists say, once the online version of you is able to operate independently, a kind of digital alter ego to whom you can delegate. “I think it’s inevitable that pretty soon we will each be represented in the digital sphere by an avatar,” Hackford says. “Your avatar will check when your parking permit needs updating. It will compare available prices on everything you want to buy. It will sit in the hold queue on the phone to buy a train ticket. It will do all the things that technology does better than you can and allow you more time for being human.” But right now, it seems we want to be more robot instead. One of autumn’s key catwalk trends, as seen at Alexander Wang, looks a lot like The Matrix, the 1999 sci-fi blockbuster set in a future in which simulated reality has cannibalised human experience. Costume designer Kym Barrett devised the oil-shine black coats to characterise what she called “a shadow world where people would disappear and reappear… as if you were tricked. Is she there? Is she not there?” This dystopian vision has been enthusiastically adopted by Bella and Gigi Hadid and Kendall and Kylie Jenner, four of the most powerful young women in the social media landscape. Long before this season’s Matrix trend, the widespread use of Photoshop had begun to shift our image of cover-girl perfection from that of a beautiful, real human being to that of a digitised version of human beauty, with impossibly even skin tone and unnaturally symmetrical features. In the last two years, the prettifying face filters that began on Snapchat have spread to Instagram Stories. These enlarge your eyes and lips, plump your cheekbones into a heart shape, replace black pupils with a flash of silver. The effect is deliberately unreal: more cartoon character than supermodel. Imitation, they say, is the sincerest form of flattery. Some things never change, and we all want to look like the cool kids. It’s just that this time around, the new kids on the block are robots. • This article was amended on 18 September 2018.

          "bodyText": "Should scholars serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony? Should you expose a fiction even if that fiction sustains the social order? In writing my latest book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, I had to struggle with this dilemma with regard to liberalism. On the one hand, I believe that the liberal story is flawed, that it does not tell the truth about humanity, and that in order to survive and flourish in the 21st century we need to go beyond it. On the other hand, at present the liberal story is still fundamental to the functioning of the global order. What’s more, liberalism is now attacked by religious and nationalist fanatics who believe in nostalgic fantasies that are far more dangerous and harmful. So should I speak my mind openly, risking that my words could be taken out of context and used by demagogues and autocrats to further attack the liberal order? Or should I censor myself? It is a mark of illiberal regimes that they make free speech more difficult even outside their borders. Due to the spread of such regimes, it is becoming increasingly dangerous to think critically about the future of our species. I eventually chose free discussion over self-censorship, thanks to my belief both in the strength of liberal democracy and in the necessity to revamp it. Liberalism’s great advantage over other ideologies is that it is flexible and undogmatic. It can sustain criticism better than any other social order. Indeed, it is the only social order that allows people to question even its own foundations. Liberalism has already survived three big crises – the first world war, the fascist challenge in the 1930s, and the communist challenge in the 1950s-70s. If you think liberalism is in trouble now, just remember how much worse things were in 1918, 1938 or 1968. In 1968, liberal democracies seemed to be an endangered species, and even within their own borders they were rocked by riots, assassinations, terrorist attacks and fierce ideological battles. If you happened to be amid the riots in Washington on the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated, or in Paris in May 1968, or at the Democratic party’s convention in Chicago in August 1968, you might well have thought that the end was near. While Washington, Paris and Chicago were descending into chaos, Moscow and Leningrad were tranquil, and the Soviet system seemed destined to endure for ever. Yet 20 years later it was the Soviet system that collapsed. The clashes of the 1960s strengthened liberal democracy, while the stifling climate in the Soviet bloc presaged its demise. So we hope liberalism can reinvent itself yet again. But the main challenge it faces today comes not from fascism or communism, and not even from the demagogues and autocrats that are spreading everywhere like frogs after the rains. This time the main challenge emerges from the laboratories. Liberalism is founded on the belief in human liberty. Unlike rats and monkeys, human beings are supposed to have “free will”. This is what makes human feelings and human choices the ultimate moral and political authority in the world. Liberalism tells us that the voter knows best, that the customer is always right, and that we should think for ourselves and follow our hearts. * * * Unfortunately, “free will” isn’t a scientific reality. It is a myth inherited from Christian theology. Theologians developed the idea of “free will” to explain why God is right to punish sinners for their bad choices and reward saints for their good choices. If our choices aren’t made freely, why should God punish or reward us for them? According to the theologians, it is reasonable for God to do so, because our choices reflect the free will of our eternal souls, which are independent of all physical and biological constraints. This myth has little to do with what science now teaches us about Homo sapiens and other animals. Humans certainly have a will – but it isn’t free. You cannot decide what desires you have. You don’t decide to be introvert or extrovert, easy-going or anxious, gay or straight. Humans make choices – but they are never independent choices. Every choice depends on a lot of biological, social and personal conditions that you cannot determine for yourself. I can choose what to eat, whom to marry and whom to vote for, but these choices are determined in part by my genes, my biochemistry, my gender, my family background, my national culture, etc – and I didn’t choose which genes or family to have. This is not abstract theory. You can witness this easily. Just observe the next thought that pops up in your mind. Where did it come from? Did you freely choose to think it? Obviously not. If you carefully observe your own mind, you come to realise that you have little control of what’s going on there, and you are not choosing freely what to think, what to feel, and what to want. Though “free will” was always a myth, in previous centuries it was a helpful one. It emboldened people who had to fight against the Inquisition, the divine right of kings, the KGB and the KKK. The myth also carried few costs. In 1776 or 1945 there was relatively little harm in believing that your feelings and choices were the product of some “free will” rather than the result of biochemistry and neurology. But now the belief in “free will” suddenly becomes dangerous. If governments and corporations succeed in hacking the human animal, the easiest people to manipulate will be those who believe in free will. In order to successfully hack humans, you need two things: a good understanding of biology, and a lot of computing power. The Inquisition and the KGB lacked this knowledge and power. But soon, corporations and governments might have both, and once they can hack you, they can not only predict your choices, but also reengineer your feelings. To do so, corporations and governments will not need to know you perfectly. That is impossible. They will just have to know you a little better than you know yourself. And that is not impossible, because most people don’t know themselves very well. If you believe in the traditional liberal story, you will be tempted simply to dismiss this challenge. “No, it will never happen. Nobody will ever manage to hack the human spirit, because there is something there that goes far beyond genes, neurons and algorithms. Nobody could successfully predict and manipulate my choices, because my choices reflect my free will.” Unfortunately, dismissing the challenge won’t make it go away. It will just make you more vulnerable to it. It starts with simple things. As you surf the internet, a headline catches your eye: “Immigrant gang rapes local women”. You click on it. At exactly the same moment, your neighbour is surfing the internet too, and a different headline catches her eye: “Trump prepares nuclear strike on Iran”. She clicks on it. Both headlines are fake news stories, generated perhaps by Russian trolls, or by a website keen on increasing traffic to boost its ad revenues. Both you and your neighbour feel that you clicked on these headlines out of your free will. But in fact you have been hacked. Propaganda and manipulation are nothing new, of course. But whereas in the past they worked like carpet bombing, now they are becoming precision-guided munitions. When Hitler gave a speech on the radio, he aimed at the lowest common denominator, because he couldn’t tailor his message to the unique weaknesses of individual brains. Now it has become possible to do exactly that. An algorithm can tell that you already have a bias against immigrants, while your neighbour already dislikes Trump, which is why you see one headline while your neighbour sees an altogether different one. In recent years some of the smartest people in the world have worked on hacking the human brain in order to make you click on ads and sell you stuff. Now these methods are being used to sell you politicians and ideologies, too. And this is just the beginning. At present, the hackers rely on analysing signals and actions in the outside world: the products you buy, the places you visit, the words you search for online. Yet within a few years biometric sensors could give hackers direct access to your inner world, and they could observe what’s going on inside your heart. Not the metaphorical heart beloved by liberal fantasies, but rather the muscular pump that regulates your blood pressure and much of your brain activity. The hackers could then correlate your heart rate with your credit card data, and your blood pressure with your search history. What would the Inquisition and the KGB have done with biometric bracelets that constantly monitor your moods and affections? Stay tuned. Liberalism has developed an impressive arsenal of arguments and institutions to defend individual freedoms against external attacks from oppressive governments and bigoted religions, but it is unprepared for a situation when individual freedom is subverted from within, and when the very concepts of “individual” and “freedom” no longer make much sense. In order to survive and prosper in the 21st century, we need to leave behind the naive view of humans as free individuals – a view inherited from Christian theology as much as from the modern Enlightenment – and come to terms with what humans really are: hackable animals. We need to know ourselves better. Of course, this is hardly new advice. From ancient times, sages and saints repeatedly advised people to “know thyself”. Yet in the days of Socrates, the Buddha and Confucius, you didn’t have real competition. If you neglected to know yourself, you were still a black box to the rest of humanity. In contrast, you now have competition. As you read these lines, governments and corporations are striving to hack you. If they get to know you better than you know yourself, they can then sell you anything they want – be it a product or a politician. It is particularly important to get to know your weaknesses. They are the main tools of those who try to hack you. Computers are hacked through pre-existing faulty code lines. Humans are hacked through pre-existing fears, hatreds, biases and cravings. Hackers cannot create fear or hatred out of nothing. But when they discover what people already fear and hate it is easy to push the relevant emotional buttons and provoke even greater fury. If people cannot get to know themselves by their own efforts, perhaps the same technology the hackers use can be turned around and serve to protect us. Just as your computer has an antivirus program that screens for malware, maybe we need an antivirus for the brain. Your AI sidekick will learn by experience that you have a particular weakness – whether for funny cat videos or for infuriating Trump stories – and would block them on your behalf. But all this is really just a side issue. If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don’t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be? For 300 years, liberal ideals inspired a political project that aimed to give as many individuals as possible the ability to pursue their dreams and fulfil their desires. We are now closer than ever to realising this aim – but we are also closer than ever to realising that this has all been based on an illusion. The very same technologies that we have invented to help individuals pursue their dreams also make it possible to re-engineer those dreams. So how can I trust any of my dreams? From one perspective, this discovery gives humans an entirely new kind of freedom. Previously, we identified very strongly with our desires, and sought the freedom to realise them. Whenever any thought appeared in the mind, we rushed to do its bidding. We spent our days running around like crazy, carried by a furious rollercoaster of thoughts, feelings and desires, which we mistakenly believed represented our free will. What happens if we stop identifying with this rollercoaster? What happens when we carefully observe the next thought that pops up in our mind and ask: “Where did that come from?” For starters, realising that our thoughts and desires don’t reflect our free will can help us become less obsessive about them. If I see myself as an entirely free agent, choosing my desires in complete independence from the world, it creates a barrier between me and all other entities. I don’t really need any of those other entities – I am independent. It simultaneously bestows enormous importance on my every whim – after all, I chose this particular desire out of all possible desires in the universe. Once we give so much importance to our desires, we naturally try to control and shape the whole world according to them. We wage wars, cut down forests and unbalance the entire ecosystem in pursuit of our whims. But if we understood that our desires are not the outcome of free choice, we would hopefully be less preoccupied with them, and would also feel more connected to the rest of the world. People sometimes imagine that if we renounce our belief in “free will”, we will become completely apathetic, and just curl up in some corner and starve to death. In fact, renouncing this illusion can have two opposite effects: first, it can create a far stronger link with the rest of the world, and make you more attentive to your environment and to the needs and wishes of others. It is like when you have a conversation with someone. If you focus on what you want to say, you hardly really listen. You just wait for the opportunity to give the other person a piece of your mind. But when you put your own thoughts aside, you can suddenly hear other people. Second, renouncing the myth of free will can kindle a profound curiosity. If you strongly identify with the thoughts and desires that emerge in your mind, you don’t need to make much effort to get to know yourself. You think you already know exactly who you are. But once you realise “Hi, this isn’t me. This is just some changing biochemical phenomenon!” then you also realise you have no idea who – or what – you actually are. This can be the beginning of the most exciting journey of discovery any human can undertake. * * * There is nothing new about doubting free will or about exploring the true nature of humanity. We humans have had this discussion a thousand times before. But we never had the technology before. And the technology changes everything. Ancient problems of philosophy are now becoming practical problems of engineering and politics. And while philosophers are very patient people – they can argue about something inconclusively for 3,000 years – engineers are far less patient. Politicians are the least patient of all. How does liberal democracy function in an era when governments and corporations can hack humans? What’s left of the beliefs that “the voter knows best” and “the customer is always right”? How do you live when you realise that you are a hackable animal, that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces. Unfortunately, these are not the questions most humans ask. Instead of exploring what awaits us beyond the illusion of “free will”, people all over the world are now retreating to find shelter with even older illusions. Instead of confronting the challenge of AI and bioengineering, many are turning to religious and nationalist fantasies that are even less in touch with the scientific realities of our time than liberalism. Instead of fresh political models, what’s on offer are repackaged leftovers from the 20th century or even the middle ages. When you try to engage with these nostalgic fantasies, you find yourself debating such things as the veracity of the Bible and the sanctity of the nation (especially if you happen, like me, to live in a place like Israel). As a scholar, this is a disappointment. Arguing about the Bible was hot stuff in the age of Voltaire, and debating the merits of nationalism was cutting-edge philosophy a century ago – but in 2018 it seems a terrible waste of time. AI and bioengineering are about to change the course of evolution itself, and we have just a few decades to figure out what to do with them. I don’t know where the answers will come from, but they are definitely not coming from a collection of stories written thousands of years ago. So what to do? We need to fight on two fronts simultaneously. We should defend liberal democracy, not only because it has proved to be a more benign form of government than any of its alternatives, but also because it places the fewest limitations on debating the future of humanity. At the same time, we need to question the traditional assumptions of liberalism, and develop a new political project that is better in line with the scientific realities and technological powers of the 21st century. Greek mythology tells that Zeus and Poseidon, two of the greatest gods, competed for the hand of the goddess Thetis. But when they heard the prophecy that Thetis would bear a son more powerful than his father, both withdrew in alarm. Since gods plan on sticking around for ever, they don’t want a more powerful offspring to compete with them. So Thetis married a mortal, King Peleus, and gave birth to Achilles. Mortals do like their children to outshine them. This myth might teach us something important. Autocrats who plan to rule in perpetuity don’t like to encourage the birth of ideas that might displace them. But liberal democracies inspire the creation of new visions, even at the price of questioning their own foundations • • Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is published by Cape.

          "headline": "Carrie Underwood: Cry Pretty review – precision-tooled country with a soupçon of sad",
          "bodyText": "Six albums into her career, Carrie Underwood sometimes seems more like a weaponised expression of modern country’s commercial power than a singer. Even the promotional bumf from her label spends more time dwelling on statistics – albums sold, awards won, streams amassed – than on her music. Mind you, that’s probably wise: Cry Pretty is precisely as interesting as the malls and insanely programmed radio stations where it will be played to death. Cry Pretty’s big “statement” is The Bullet, a song Underwood has apparently been considering for inclusion on several albums, using it this time in response to the Las Vegas mass shooting of last year. The build-up leads you to expect a lacerating critique of US gun culture; what you get is a lachrymose exposition of the misery of families who lose a loved one to shooting. “You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns,” Underwood sings, in a “who really knows how people end up dead with bullets in them?” sort of way. Ghosts on the Stereo – with namechecks for “Hank, Haggard and Jones” – is the obligatory nod to forebears whose family connection is now very remote indeed. Cry Pretty is an album of power ballads and – on Drinking Alone and End Up With You – nods to pop R&amp;B. It’s not horrible, but it feels very much like something that could have been produced without any human involvement; it is all gloss and shine, with sadness at industry-approved levels of maximum efficacy. Take 75% uplift, add 20% melancholy, top up with 5% not actually contentious controversy, and voilà: Cry Pretty."

          "headline": "Viral publisher Unilad faces insolvency action by HMRC",
          "bodyText": "The viral publisher Unilad, known for its commitment to student-friendly online “banter”, is facing insolvency proceedings following a demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) amid concerns over the future of the site’s Facebook-centric business model. HMRC issued a winding-up petition against Unilad’s parent company in July, which is due to be heard at the high court next week. Such notices are usually issued when a business has failed to pay its taxes and the company could be liquidated unless it can come to an agreement. “The situation with HMRC is being resolved swiftly,” said a spokesperson for Unilad, who declined to give any further information on the social media publisher’s financial position or why it was facing the demand from the taxman. The British site is currently the fourth biggest publisher on Facebook, according to analysis service NewsWhip, attracting more interactions from readers than major news outlets such as the New York Times, MailOnline, and the BBC. It has continued to rise up the Facebook rankings in recent months despite the social network’s insistence it is changing its algorithm to push higher-quality news in people’s newsfeeds. There are continued concerns over whether such social media-centric publishers can continue to thrive and build sustainable business models, especially while relying on native advertising – where the sites produce their own content such as branded video for advertisers. A spokesperson for Unilad also declined to comment on claims that staff had recently been laid off by the site. There was also no response to suggestions that the company could struggle to pay the site’s original founder Alex Partridge following a lengthy court case regarding his right to a stake in the company. Earlier this year Unilad co-chief executive Sam Bentley left the Manchester-based company following unspecific “allegations of historic misconduct made against the company”, with Unilad saying other staff had been disciplined as a result of an internal investigation. The site began life as a viral Facebook page founded in 2010 by Partridge, an Oxford Brookes university student who coincidentally also founded its arch-rival LADbible. Unilad’s original incarnation was briefly shut down two years later after being held up as symptomatic of “lad culture” and facing a backlash over posts that made jokes about rape and homophobia. The Unilad brand and its Facebook page were later reused for a new site launched in 2014 under the leadership of Liam Harrington and Bentley, who were both in their early 20s. The site’s main Facebook page currently has 40 million followers, who see a mix of lighthearted news stories, memes, and viral videos. On Wednesday afternoon stories include the “Terrifying moment worker discovers dozens of rats under concrete”, a video of a cow with three horns in Brazil, and a tribute post to the BBC series Peaky Blinders. Harrington told the Guardian in 2016 that publishers such as his are “social enterprises that are catering to everyone” and in common with other male-focussed viral publishers, had toned down its more extreme and offensive content and increased the number of features on issues such as men’s mental health. It also has a variety of sites and Facebook pages covering tech, gaming, food, and sport and launched a longform documentary series on the “Dark side of Britain”."

          "headline": "The São Paulo taxi firm that dares to go where Uber doesn't",
          "bodyText": "Brasilândia feels more like a village in its own right than a peripheral district in a bustling metropolis of nearly 20 million people. Miles from the hustle and bustle of São Paulo’s central area, children play in the streets and passersby greet each other. That does not, however, mean non-residents are comfortable coming here. Peripheral districts have a reputation for violence and crime, and many large taxi companies and ride-hailing apps such as Uber, 99 and Cabify refuse to accept trips to parts of the periphery – including sections of Brasilândia – due to safety concerns. With few locals able to afford a car and public transport options severely limited, this is a problem. An estimated 300,000 residents live in small working-class houses and favelas, and incomes are among the lowest in the city. People here live on an average of 502 reais (£94) per capita per month – less than a third of the São Paulo average and a world away from the 4,967 reais (£930) of those in the district of Moema. The nearest metro station is five miles away and locals rely on overcrowded and unreliable buses. One small company is trying to change that, though – by hiring local drivers, offering alternatives to smartphone booking, and accepting payments in cash or petrol. That company is Ubra – an obvious nod to Uber, but also a portmanteau from “Union of Brasilândia”. Former app driver Alvimar da Silva started it last year with his son, daughter and some friends when he realised he was making more money giving informal rides to his neighbours in Brasilândia than working for the big ride-hailing firms. “There’s a myth about the periphery being dangerous,” says Da Silva. “I say violence is everywhere – probably even more so in the central area than in the periphery. Our modus operandi was hiring local drivers, born and resident in Brasilândia, who are not prejudiced against it and are not afraid to work here.” Uber, 99 and Cabify all admit they flag trips that start or end in certain places. Uber says its app “can prevent trip calls from areas with public safety challenges in specific days or times”, adding that it uses an algorithm with machine-learning technology that evaluates risks based on “real-time analysis of the data from the millions of trips performed daily through the app”. The company 99 says its app notifies drivers “when a trip starts, ends or passes through areas of the city that are considered risky”, leaving them to decide whether or not to accept it. Similarly, Cabify confirms that the company doesn’t operate in certain areas, including Brasilândia. According to its own figures, Ubra performs 5,000 to 6,000 trips a month, the vast majority of them either starting or finishing in Brasilândia. Gilberto Oliveira Souza, known as Japa, works as a hairdresser in the area. He describes the new services as “a blessing”. “It helps us a lot, we use it all the time: to go shopping, to take our child to the doctor … It really lets us off the hook.” Previously, his family faced a long walk to the bus terminal and an uncertain wait for a bus. Even when they got a ride home in a taxi or one of the large ride-hailing companies, sometimes the driver would refuse to go inside the neighbourhood, meaning another long walk. Ubra works much like other ride-hailing firms: users download a third-party app, create a profile and enter their location and destination. Once a driver is located, the user gets the car model and licence plate, the driver’s name and the estimated time of arrival. But Ubra also allows passengers to order a ride by calling a phone number or sending a WhatsApp message. This allows access to people without mobile phones or with a poor internet connection, both common in São Paulo’s periphery. It also makes the service available to the less digitally savvy. This quest for accessibility can take imaginative turns. “When drivers don’t have a credit card terminal and a passenger doesn’t have cash, one of the things we do is to ask the passenger if he would mind stopping at a gas station and paying the cost of the ride in gasoline,” says Da Silva. Ubra hopes to scale up to other under-served areas and recruit local drivers there. “Our focus is in the areas that are being excluded [from the other apps], but we will eventually work in all São Paulo”, says Aline Landim, Da Silva’s daughter. Finding local drivers to work in these places will not be a problem: “There is a large demand from the drivers themselves to work just around their neighbourhoods. They want to avoid traffic and gasoline expenses, while being close to their homes and families.” The company is also developing its own bespoke app – and plans to change its name to Jaubra to avoid legal problems with Uber. “Brasilândia has over 300,000 people and I estimate that we currently serve only 2% to 3% of the neighbourhood,” says Da Silva. “With the new app, I think we are going to take a leap forward to 15% or 20%, but it could be more, because the big companies are increasingly vetting the periphery. The more they exclude, the more we will include.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"

          "bodyText": "When Matt Lees became a full-time YouTuber, he felt as if he had won the lottery. As a young, ambitious writer, director and presenter, he was able to create low-budget, high-impact films that could reach a worldwide audience, in a way that would have been impossible without the blessing of television’s gatekeepers just a few years earlier. In February 2013, he had his first viral hit, an abridged version of Sony’s announcement of its PlayStation 4 video game console, dubbed with a cheerily acerbic commentary. Within days the video had been watched millions of times. “It hardly seems viral at all, by today’s standards,” Lees says, yet it was one of the most viewed videos on YouTube that month. The boost to Lees’ ego was nothing compared with the effect it had on his career. When YouTube’s algorithm notices this sort of success, it starts directing viewers to the uploader’s other videos, earning the channel more subscribers and, via the snippety advertisements that play before each one, higher income. Overnight, Lees had what seemed like the first shoots of a sustainable career. Excitement soon gave way to anxiety. Even in 2013, Lees was aware that his success depended not so much on smash hits as on day-by-day reliability. “It’s not enough to simply create great things,” he says. “The audience expect consistency. They expect frequency. Without these, it’s incredibly easy to slip off the radar and lose favour with the algorithm that gave you your wings.” By the end of the year Lees had grown his channel from 1,000 subscribers to 90,000, and caught the attention of one of his influences, Charlie Brooker, who invited Lees to collaborate on writing a Channel 4 special. For a month Lees worked 20-hour days, dividing his time between the TV script work and, ever conscious that missing a day’s upload could cause his videos to tumble down the search rankings, his YouTube channel. At the end of the month he was pale, gaunt and tired in a way that, he recalls, seemed “impervious to rest”. His work, he noticed, had become increasingly rushed and harsh in tone. Yet the angry, provocative quality of his videos seemed only to be making them more popular. “Divisive content is the king of online media today, and YouTube heavily boosts anything that riles people up,” he says. “It’s one of the most toxic things: the point at which you’re breaking down is the point at which the algorithm loves you the most.” Lees began to feel a knock-on effect on his health. “Human brains really aren’t designed to be interacting with hundreds of people every day,” he says. “When you’ve got thousands of people giving you direct feedback on your work, you really get the sense that something in your mind just snaps. We just aren’t built to handle empathy and sympathy on that scale.” Lees developed a thyroid problem, and began to experience more frequent and persistent stretches of depression. “What started out as being the most fun job imaginable quickly slid into something that felt deeply bleak and lonely,” he says. *** For years, YouTubers have believed that they are loved most by their audience when they project a chirpy, grateful image. But what happens when the mask slips? This year there has been a wave of videos by prominent YouTubers talking about their burnout, chronic fatigue and depression. “This is all I ever wanted,” said Elle Mills, a 20-year-old Filipino-Canadian YouTuber in a (monetised) video entitled Burnt Out At 19, posted in May. “And why the fuck am I so unfucking unhappy? It doesn’t make any sense. You know what I mean? Because, like, this is literally my fucking dream. And I’m fucking so un-fucking-happy.” Mills had gained a lot of attention (and 3.6m views) for a slick and cleverly edited five-minute video she posted last November in which she came out as bisexual to her friends, family and followers (many of whom had been asking about her sexuality in the comments). She went on to be featured on the cover of Diva magazine, and won a Shorty award for “breakout YouTuber”. But six months later she posted the Burnt Out video, explaining how her schoolgirl ambition of becoming a YouTuber had led her to bigger and bigger audiences, but that “it’s not what I expected. I’m always stressed. My anxiety and depression keep getting worse. I’m waiting to hit my breaking point.” The same month Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, a 28-year-old Spaniard who is currently the world’s third most popular YouTuber, with more than 30 million subscribers, talked about how he felt as if he was heading for a breakdown, and had, as a result, decided to take a break. They are the latest in a string of high-profile YouTubers, including Erik Phillips (better known as M3RKMUS1C, with 4 million subscribers) and Benjamin Vestergaard (Crainer, with 2.8 million), to have announced hiatuses from the channel, or described their struggles with exhaustion. The anxieties are tied up with the relentless nature of their work. Tyler Blevins, AKA Ninja, makes an estimated $500,000 (£384,000) every month via live broadcasts of him playing the video game Fortnite on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon. Most of Blevins’ revenue comes from Twitch subscribers or viewers who provide one-off donations (often in the hope that he will thank them by name “on air”). Blevins recently took to Twitter to complain that he didn’t feel he could stop streaming. “Wanna know the struggles of streaming over other jobs?” he wrote, perhaps ill-advisedly for someone with such a stratospheric income. “I left for less than 48 hours and lost 40,000 subscribers on Twitch. I’ll be back today… grinding again.” There was little sympathy on Twitter for the millionaire. But the pressure he described is felt at every level of success, from the titans of the content landscape all the way down to the people with channels with just a few thousand subscribers, all of whom feel they must be constantly creating, always available and responding to their fans. “Constant releases build audience loyalty,” says Austin Hourigan, who runs ShoddyCast, a YouTube channel with 1.2 million subscribers. “The more loyalty you build, the more likely your viewers are to come back, which gives you the closest thing to a financial safety net in what is otherwise a capricious space.” When a YouTuber passes the 1 million subscribers mark, they are presented with a gold plaque to mark the event. Many of these plaques can be seen on shelves and walls in the background of presenters’ rooms. In this way, the size of viewership and quantity of uploads become the main markers of value. Professional YouTubers speak in tones at once reverential and resentful of the power of “the Algorithm” (it’s seen as a near-sentient entity, not only by creators, but also by YouTube’s own engineers). Created by the high priests of Silicon Valley, who continually tweak its characteristics, this is the programming code on which the fate of every YouTuber depends. It decides which videos to pluck from the Niagara of content that splashes on to YouTube every hour (400 hours’ worth every 60 seconds, according to Google) to deliver as “recommended viewing” to the service’s billions of users. Every time you log on to YouTube you are presented with videos chosen by the algorithm. The idea is that a clip particularly well suited to your tastes will inspire you to click the Subscribe button – which, hopefully, will bring you back to watch a new episode tomorrow. The viewer feels that YouTube understands what he or she likes, while advertisers are reassured that the video in front of which their five-second commercial will run will reach an appropriately targeted audience.When your income is dependent on the number of people who watch your videos each week, this code can decide what, or even whether, you eat. And, 13 years into YouTube’s existence, many believe it has come to sit at the core of a growing mental health crisis among video creators. In April this year there was a particularly extreme example, when 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam entered YouTube’s Californian campus and opened fire on employees with a 9mm pistol, wounding three before she killed herself. A video Aghdam uploaded prior to the attack suggested that it was driven by her belief that the company’s algorithm had passed over her videos; in March she posted on Instagram, “All my YouTube channels got filtered by YouTube so my videos hardly get views.”Algorithm-led content curation makes creators feel disposable, challenging them to churn out videos in the knowledge that there are younger, fresher people waiting in the wings to replace them. For YouTubers who use their daily lives as raw material for their videos, there is added pressure, as the traditional barriers between personal and professional life are irreparably eroded. At a recent party at a conference for YouTubers and streamers, Hourigan was standing with a group of YouTubers when he quipped: “I think every YouTube career should come with a coupon for a free therapist.” Everybody laughed, he recalls, but “in a sad way”. “By the way,” he adds, “I’m medicated and have a therapist.” *** Katherine Lo is a researcher into online communities at the University of California, Irvine. For her, it’s not simply the frequency and consistency of content creation that lead to burnout, but the specific nature of the work required to keep audiences engaged, which includes being active on social media, interacting with fans, and other roles beyond writing, presenting and editing. “This kind of labour is often invisible but very taxing and a major contributor to occupational stress,” Lo explains. “In many cases it can contribute to PTSD, especially when creators are subject to harassment, threats to their safety and privacy, or ongoing toxicity in their community.” She recently developed a list of occupational factors that contribute to mental health risks for creators. It includes the exhaustion that comes from performing “familiarity” with the audience, the stress of reading comments, the financial anxiety associated with managing sponsorships and donations, and the pressure of managing reputation and professional ties in the YouTuber community, where recommendations are key to getting fans. Those who work on larger channels, which have enough money to employ a staff and spread the pressure, are not immune to these risks. Belinda Zoller joined the team behind the Extra Credits YouTube channel in 2016. The channel publishes weekly lessons in video game design and world history, using cheery animations. It has close to 1.6 million subscribers; Zoller works as a moderator, responding to comments. Moderation is one of the most gruelling jobs in the web’s emergent economy, and while Zoller does not work in front of the camera, her role puts her in the firing line for anonymous abuse and bad-faith interaction. Within months she was exhausted. “There is a lot of emotional labour involved in my work,” she says. “I empathise with the root of people’s concerns and criticisms, even if I disagree with some of them.” Zoller views YouTube as her primary “office space” – a shift that, she says, has “very much negatively impacted my mental health”. No matter how much she enjoys helping to run a popular channel, the platform itself is steeped in negativity. Moderating comments in order to maintain a clean and safe online space is like weeding a garden: every time a root is pulled up, another three nose through the soil in its place. Zoller believes that, far from wanting to deal with the negativity, YouTube actively encourages it via the design of the algorithm. “People tend not to discuss content unless they have very strong opinions about it, and most of the time those strong opinions favour disagreement,” she explains. “So the algorithm favours clickbait and controversial content over meaningfully nuanced and positive content.” For Lo, video-based social media platforms are catastrophically failing those who sustain their business. “YouTube fails to protect creators from the extremely common occupational hazards of being doxxed, stalked, harassed and threatened online,” she says. (Doxxing is the revealing of someone’s identity or other personal information.) “They claim no responsibility for the wellbeing of their creators or the communities they create.” Asked about Lo’s comments, a spokeswoman for YouTube replies: “Harassment is abhorrent and wrong. YouTube has policies against harassment and bullying, as indicated in our community guidelines. We review flagged content quickly, and remove inappropriate videos according to our policies.” In order to avoid burnout, it encourages creators to “take breaks, enjoy weekends, nights and vacations just like any job”. “Of course,” the spokeswoman adds, “we always hope creators are discussing their struggles openly with others in the YouTube community.” As part of its Creator Academy, a vast online “school” covering everything from how to “enhance your channel’s search and discovery potential” to how to “make deals with brands”, YouTube recently commissioned a series of videos designed to teach its partners how to avoid fatigue. (Few of the people I speak to who run YouTube channels are aware of the resource.) The video on burnout has been viewed just over 32,000 times. It’s written and presented by 34-year-old Kati Morton. A licensed therapist based in Los Angeles, Morton has been posting videos to YouTube for eight years. As such, she is well placed to understand both the problem and the potential solution. In 2010, when she started her channel, Morton was working as a therapist with a private practice. YouTube was her way to reach a wider audience with tips and information that she believed could help them. Three years ago, her success on the platform enabled her to become a full-time YouTuber, but learning to personally manage the pressures she had warned about has been challenging. “I am no better than anyone else,” she says. “I’ve got tired, stressed about everything. It was a journey to get to the place where I felt able to tell my audience that I would be taking a vacation.” That holiday, a two-week break last Christmas, was the first Morton had taken since going full-time in 2015. “Maybe I took a long weekend the summer before, for our anniversary?” she says. “No. Wait. I worked then, too.” Every time Morton posts a new video she is expected to be in the comments, responding to questions and suggestions, before starting work on the next. “I have trouble with boundaries,” she says. “I always feel like I should be working, or that they’re counting on me.” Like all YouTubers, Morton also feels the financial pressure of the system, which typically pays between £1.50 and £3 for every 1,000 views. “The reward for your work is liable to change at any time,” she says. “Your views can go down for a variety of reasons, and when that happens, you earn less.” For this reason, even with close to half a million subscribers, Morton feels unable to employ anyone to help her with the workload. YouTube recommends that creators who are struggling “enlist support”. Morton argues that, for the majority, it is an impossible expense. “If I had someone supporting me it would make all the difference,” she says. “But I’d need my daily views to double before I’d feel comfortable doing that. Could you imagine having to fire someone because my views went down? That would be awful.” For her, the solution comes back to the algorithm. “YouTube rewards people who produce daily,” she says. “They made the algorithm, so they have the power to remake it. If they set different criteria, it would help. We are human beings. We need some time for ourselves.” Matt Lees is furious at what he sees as YouTube’s lacklustre approach to support and advice. “Encouraging creators to ‘take a break’ is pretty laughable from a system that actively promotes quantity over quality,” he says. “There’s no sense of responsibility for the culture that YouTube has created.” For Katherine Lo, the capacity to maintain a healthy work/life balance while being successful on YouTube and Twitch is a “barely possible” dream. “ They offer highly precarious work, where the promise of robust success – where one has a reliable, sustainable income – is only enjoyed by a small percentage of creators. Trying to reduce frequency of content and establish work/life balance merely adds even more risk.” The demands of the YouTuber life suit younger creators – and the largest demographic on the site is those in their 20s (when once teenagers may have dreamed of becoming pop stars, now they dream of becoming YouTubers). Many find it possible to keep creating at a high enough rate, if only for a few years. “At that age you absolutely can,” Lees says. “You’ve got the energy and focus to work incredibly long hours, you’ve got very few responsibilities to take your attention away from work, and – perhaps most importantly – you’ve likely still got a solid social circle, friendships that aren’t difficult to maintain.” But, as every casualty of childhood stardom demonstrates, early success carries with it tremendous risk. “The journey to creative stardom used to take more time – learning the ropes and developing a thick skin, and having a team of advisers and trusted friends,” says Chris O’Sullivan, from the UK charity the Mental Health Foundation. “Today, you can become a superstar online with one viral video – at any age or stage and from any location. Without support and guidance, the potential to be burned by the exposure is great.” As time goes on, and life grows more complicated, the sense of isolation, anxiety and weariness is exacerbated. “I spent my 20s working ceaselessly, feeling invincible and boundless,” Lees says. “And honestly, I was. Right up until the point where I wasn’t.” • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article. Commenting on this piece?

          "headline": "Imprisoned by algorithms: the dark side of California ending cash bail",
          "bodyText": "Amber-Rose Howard nearly lost everything when she was thrown in jail as a teenager. The California high schooler was a straight-A student who had offers from more than a dozen universities when she was arrested for a serious charge in 2004. After she spent two weeks behind bars, her family raised money for bail, and she slowly got her life back on track. While her case, a first-time offense, moved through the courts, she finished her classes and enrolled in college. Under a new California law passed last week, however, the same arrest would have played out differently. That’s because an algorithm would have determined her fate – and probably imprisoned her indefinitely. California made international headlines after it became the first US state to fully eliminate cash bail, abolishing the practice that has long allowed wealthy criminal defendants to buy their freedom pre-trial while the poor languish in jail for minor charges. The legislation was celebrated by liberals for ending a cruel and unconstitutional system, but some activist groups that originally supported the bill ultimately urged governor Jerry Brown not to sign it. The law replaces the cash bail system with “risk assessment” tools in which an algorithm would weigh factors about a person to help determine whether they should be released. Critics say it gives local authorities wide discretion to decide what is considered “high risk”, makes it easy for prosecutors and judges to keep people in jail, and expands the use of technology that could intensify racial biases. Some fear it would enable an increase in pre-trial incarceration. “This will be totally devastating,” said Howard, a 32-year-old organizer who said she supported the end of the bail system, but opposed the legislation. “These risk assessment tools are likely going to classify our people as a risk … We’re all in a lot of danger.” There is bipartisan agreement that cash bail is a fundamentally flawed model that has fueled mass incarceration and created two tiers of justice – forcing low-income defendants to spend months or longer behind bars without a conviction while losing their jobs, homes and families. They’re often pressured into guilty pleas. There is little consensus, however, about the best replacement. The California law broadly paves the way for “preventive detention”, which critics say encourages pre-trial detention as a default in a number of scenarios and gives courts far-reaching authority to determine someone is a “public safety” threat and should be jailed. “This makes it your burden from jail to prove that you’re entitled to freedom, a fundamental constitutional right,” said Chesa Boudin, a deputy public defender in San Francisco. The assemblyman Rob Bonta, co-author of the legislation, said in an interview that critics were misinterpreting the legislation and cited estimates that 120,000 more people would be released per year under the new model: “The whole idea of this bill is to make sure people aren’t detained unnecessarily.” The law also calls for an assessment algorithm to create an individual “risk score” that supposedly reveals the likelihood of re-arrest or failure to appear in court if released. Software would in effect compare the individual with people with similar profiles, which means using data from a criminal justice system that has documented discrimination at every step – including racial biases in police stops, searches and arrests. The most sophisticated algorithm would still “replicate” those biases, said Natasha Minsker of the ACLU, which revoked its support of the bill. “At worst, it’s going to amplify those biases.” People with arrest records, who may live in communities of color that are over-policed, could be deemed “high risk” and jailed as a result. “We are replacing money bail with an even more harmful system of profiling,” said Ivette Alé, an organizer with Californians United for a Responsible Budget (Curb), a reform group that opposed the bill. There is no evidence suggesting that these kinds of algorithms have produced positive changes when implemented, said Megan T Stevenson, a George Mason University professor who studied risk assessment in Kentucky. After the state mandated use of the tools in 2011, racial disparities in pre-trial detention worsened over time – with an increase in the rate of white defendants being released, but no change for black defendants. California’s law also sets the stage for the detention of people who would be scored as “low risk” if they are accused of a serious crime. When Howard was arrested in high school 14 years ago, for example, she had no record, was accomplished in academics and sports, and had family support on the outside. Even if pre-trial release would provide the best outcome, the system today would probably detain her simply due to the allegations. “It’s a nightmare to even think about,” said Howard, who is also a Curb organizer, noting that she would have likely faced a long prison sentence if she had to fight her case while incarcerated. “It would’ve definitely destroyed my life.” Instead, she negotiated a deal that allowed her to stay in school and avoid prison time. Under the new measure, more young defendants could have the same experience as Jayda Rasberry, another Los Angeles reform activist who also faced a serious charge at age 18 – and was detained pre-trial because she couldn’t afford bail. “When you’re inside of jail, it’s guilty until proven innocent,” said Rasberry, who eventually signed a plea deal and spent six years in state prison. “I just felt like I didn’t matter, and my life was over.” Pre-trial detention sent Rasberry on a path to a prison system where inmates like her didn’t always survive, the 31-year-old said, noting she lost friends behind bars. “I’m blessed to still be here. I’m functional, but I’m not okay.” Instead of bail, she added, “there needs to be a system in place that helps us instead of hurts us”. Howard suggested the state should implement “needs assessments” instead of risk assessments, shifting the focus to rehabilitation and services. The new system should also do more to give people meaningful due process when prosecutors seek to detain them, instead of giving courts “machinery to increase incarceration”, said John Raphling of the Human Rights Watch. Senator Bob Hertzberg, co-author of the law, said there would be reviews to ensure the algorithms weren’t biased and noted that the risk assessments were just one tool in determining detention. Eliminating bail was the “first step” of reform, he added. “We are going to make any and all adjustments to the system to continue to make sure that it’s fair.”"

          "headline": "Twitter's Jack Dorsey faces more questions as Google snubs Congress – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "This four-hour House hearing was incredibly long, but not particularly illuminating, except insofar as revealing the personal preoccupations of various individual congresspeople. To recap the events of the day: Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee, largely about their efforts to combat foreign interference in US elections. The senate hearing was largely collegial, with both the tech executives and the lawmakers generally expressing their desire to work together to address coordinated attacks. Google was represented by an empty chair, having declined to make Sundar Pichai or Larry Page available to testify. The company’s absence made it a convenient target for lawmakers, and given how cordial the questioning was, it did not look good that Google was unwilling to show up. The Senate hearing was followed by a marathon grilling of Jack Dorsey by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Much of the House hearing was taken up with largely specious allegations of bias against conservatives by Republican lawmakers, who have spun a narrative of censorship out of very thin gruel. Dorsey was also asked about issues like harassment, cyberbullying, algorithmic bias, data privacy, foreign interference and more. The ultimate winner of the day was probably Dorsey, who kept his patience while being asked to answer the same questions over and over again, and managed to deliver a consistent message about working to improve Twitter without falling into any obvious political potholes. Markwayne Mullin asks Dorey if he’s conservative, liberal, socialist or what. Dorsey says he tries to focus on the issues. He’s a registered independent, he says. Ryan Costello asks for a complete accounting of “all of the signals” that the Twitter algorithm uses. Dorsey says that it can’t really, because they change all the time. Rush: Do you consider President Trump’s tweets to be abusive at all? Dorsey says that all accounts are held to the same standard, but that the company weighs public interest when it comes to enforcement. This is the policy the wrote to provide themselves an excuse not to have to censor world leaders, which would be a minefield. Bobby Rush is going back to the Frank Pallone’s questions about a civil rights audit. Now he’s asking about Twitter being used to organize violence. Raul Ruiz of California says that we’re in the home stretch. He’s bearing down on the number of fake accounts on Twitter, for some reason that is unclear. Buchshon asks about the diversity of the workforce. Dorsey says that Twitter recognizes that it needs to decentralize out of San Francisco, mentioning how expensive it is. He says he’s excited to be a more “distributed” company. Larry Bucshon asks if the algorithms are publicly available to be reviewed for bias. Dorsey: Not today, but says he’s open to more transparency. Long is now discussing the tweets that get sent to him by email from Twitter. He was sent “highlights” emails of tweets, and he is reading the names of the accounts whose tweets are included. They are mostly political reporters. I think the implication here is that there aren’t enough Republicans included. “They’re all pretty much Trump bashing,” he says. Dorsey: It doesn’t sound like we served you well in matching your interests. Billy Long of Missouri is praising Dorsey for his mannerisms and comportment. So that’s nice. Paul Tonko is criticizing Twitter’s election advertising system in comparison to Facebook’s. Dorsey says that it’s a work in progress. Bill Johnson of Ohio is talking about algorithms as being like art. Do you do peer reviews of algorithms? Dorsey: Yes. Johnson: Can’t you modify your algorithms to be more intelligent on alerting certain things? Is it unreasonable to think that Twitter could not modify its algorithms to hit on illegal drug sales? Dorsey: Not unreasonable at all, it’s just a matter of work. Debbie Dingell asks about the datasets that are used to train Twitter’s AI and what kind of explainability its algorithms have. Dorsey seems kind of excited to get some different questions, but he doesn’t directly answer them. Gus Bilirakis is raising concerns about school threats on Twitter. It is a bit rich that a pro-gun Floridian congressman with an “A” rating from the NRA would be raising the issue of school safety with a social media company, but here we are. Scott Peters of California says that Twitter has “democratized democracy” which makes about as much sense as most of the other comments in this hearing, which is heading toward its third hour. Morgan Griffith of Virginia also wants to talk about drug sales on social media. Dorsey says that the company is really focusing on foreign interference in elections. Tony Cardenas also wants to talk about online bullying. He mentions Melania Trump’s campaign against cyberbullying, and takes a shot at Donald Trump. As with most of the issues here, however, Twitter is certainly not the most important platform to talk about cyberbullying with. According to Pew, US teenagers are vastly more likely to be using YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. A lot of Democrats are trying to bait Dorsey into calling out the Republicans for bad faith, but he’s not biting. Joe Kennedy: Why do you outsource reporting abuse to users? Dorsey: Well, we don’t feel great about it. David Loebsack of Iowa wants to talk about the use of social media by teenagers and concerns about harassment and cyberbullying. He asks if they are making any changes for young users. David McKinley of West Virginia is asking whether Twitter takes responsibility for the opioid crisis, referencing a study showing illegal drug ads. He references an ad for cocaine that went up in the last hour. “I would be ashamed if I were you,” he says. Lujan is now pointing out that Congress hasn’t actually passed any laws relating to Russian interference, Cambridge Analytica, or the Equifax breach and that this hearing might be a bit of a waste of time. Ben Lujan: During the purge of bots, who lost more followers, Trump or Obama? Dorsey: I don’t know. Lujan is jocularly asking whether there is a conspiracy against Obama because he lost more bot followers than Trump. Dorsey is just playing it straight. Olson asks if Twitter prioritizes emergency outreach, referencing Hurricane Harvey. Dorsey says that Twitter does prioritize emergency response, says that when 911 failed, people were able to use Twitter to ask for rescue. Pete Olson of Texas is asking about the political bias of the Trust and Safety council. Dorsey points out that the council is just advisory. Peter Welch of Vermont complains about having a hearing to deal with Trump’s specious allegations of anti-conservative bias. Welch moves on to questions of privacy, hate speech, and abuse: Bottom line, do you believe that this should be something that should be decided company by company, or should we have rules of the road that are moderated by elected officials? Dorsey: We don’t want to compete on this. Independent of what the government things we should do, we are going to continue to do this work, and share our approach. This is not an area for us to compete. Part of what is frustrating about this hearing is that the constant refrain from Republicans about anti-conservative bias simply muddies the water about real algorithmic bias. And we’re back. Next up is Leonard Lance, who again wants to discuss the Meghan McCain tweet. Lance: I think it’s the unanimous view of this committee is that 5 hours is intolerable. We’re on a five minute recess. One of the silly things about this hearing is that, in order to show that they are focused on “serious” issues instead of the imaginary shadowbanning problem that the Republicans are harping on, Democrats keep bringing up serious issues that aren’t actually that serious on Twitter, like data privacy, discriminatory advertising or foreign interference in elections. Those are certainly important issues, but they are primarily issues with Facebook, which was not asked to appear at this hearing. Twitter is a comparatively tiny platform (300m users versus more than 2 billion) that holds an outsize importance in the minds of politicians and journalists. And the platform’s problems are much different – and arguably less insidious – than those of Facebook. Gregg Harper also wants to talk about the number of Republican and the number of Democrats who were “shadowbanned”. I wrote about the particular blindness that affects American politicians who insist on thinking that tech algorithms are biased in partisan ways here. Sarbones says he will submit questions for Dorsey in writing while he uses his time to discuss Republican intransigence about investigating the Trump administration. John Sarbones of Maryland says he is worried that this hearing is the result of Republicans “working the refs”. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is again raising the issue of the offensive tweet about Meghan McCain. Dorsey says, as he said before, that the tweet violated standards and should have been taken down early. He also reiterates that Twitter is trying to take burden of reporting abuse off the person who receives the abuse. Kathy Castor raises the issue of the Justice Departmeent apparently investigating bias, and suggests that Republicans are running their own “influence” campaign to spread the idea of conservative bias. Dorsey: People do see us as a digital public square and that comes with very serious obligations. Castor praises Dorsey for being diplomatic in his answer. Robert Latta asks if there is political bias in verification. Dorsey: The program is paused, but we make exceptions for government figures, brands, and public figures. Engel: Are you aware of current foreign interference operations related to the midterms? Dorsey: None that we haven’t already reported. Per Sheera Frenkel of the New York Times, the woman who was shouting was alt-right activist Laura Loomer. Eliot Engel of New York asks about the recent news about an Iranian influence operation, asks whether it’s concerning that a third-party identified it first. Someone in the audience is shouting. Someone with a microphone is pretending to do an auction, I think to drown her out... Scalise is back on shadowbanning now. This is going to be a long afternoon of Republicans stating with no evidence that the “shadowbanning” issue was the result of bias against conservatives. There is very little listening going on at this hearing. Steve Scalise of Louisiana: What we’re concerned about is how Twitter has in some ways selectively adversely affected conservatives. Scalise alleges that Twitter banned a Marsha Blackburn ad about the alleged “sale of body parts”. Dorsey: This was a mistake and we do apologize. Scalise wants to know if someone was held accountable. This is like a weird customer support call. Dorsi Matsui asks about inferring identities from metadata. Dorsey points out that Twitter is mostly public, so the data involved is less sensitive than “peer companies”, aka Facebook and Google. Matsui now raises blockchain technology and asks what potential applications it has for Twitter. Dorsey: Blockchain is one that has a lot of untapped potential, specifically around distributed trust and distributed enforcement. He says they haven’t gone that deep on blockchain but do have people “thinking about it”. Joe Barton of Texas says that Dorsey doesn’t look like a CEO. Dorsey says his mother agrees. Barton then returns to alleging partisan bias, asking if there were Democrats within the 600,000 people who were affected by the auto-correct issue. Dorsey says yes, but declines to name them. Barton says “it’s hard to stomach” that Twitter isn’t discriminating against Republicans and that they wouldn’t be having this hearing if it wasn’t generally agreed upon that Twitter does discriminate against conservatives. This is very silly. Doyle: How can we ensure you have the proper incentives to address toxicity? Dorsey: Our singular focus in on improving health right now, and we realize that will have short term costs, such as removing accounts. Doyle: Right, there’s an economic disincentive to act because it removes people from the platform. Dorsey: We believe this is a growth vector for us, long term. Even if it hurts us in the short term. Doyle says that the entire premise of the hearing, that conservatives are being censored, is “a load of crap”. He then turns to bullying and harassment, which he says are real issues. Michael Doyle of Pennsylvania: “Social media is being rigged to censor conservatives – is that true?” Dorsey: No. Doyle reads further statements by Republicans that accuse Twitter of censoring conservatives. Dorsey denies them. Doyle points out the absurdity of Twitter having its own hearing without other social media companies, then turns to the “shadowbanning” issue: “You were equal opportunity shadowbanning, right?” Dorsey: Yes. Michael Burgess of Texas mentions the utility of Twitter as a real time news source, but says he is concerned about issues like a doctored photo of Meghan McCain that circulated over the weekend. Dorsey: That was unacceptable. We don’t want to use our scale as an excuse here. We can’t place the burden on the victims, and we need to build technology so we’re not waiting for reports ... This was an image, and we just didn’t apply the image filter to recognize what was going on in real time ... We are using that as a lesson. Burgess asks if Dorsey will apologize to the McCain family, and Dorsey says he will. Green asks about bots. Dorsey: We identify 8-10m accounts per week, and challenge them to prove they’re human. Gene Green of Texas raises the GDPR and privacy. He asks if Twitter will allow users in the US to opt out of tracking. Dorsey: Even before GDPR was enacted, we were actively making sure that the people that we serve have the controls to opt out of tracking across the web. We are very different from our peers in that the majority of what is on Twitter is public. John Shimkus, of Illinois is raising concerns about Twitter potentially suppressing controversial speech. The he asks about the verification process. Dorsey: To be very frank, our verification program is not where it needs to be. It needs a reboot and reworking. Dorsey says that verification started in order to verify the CDC during a swine flu outbreak, but needs to be addressed more comprehensively. This became a major issue when Twitter verified the account of Jason Kessler, the organizer of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Diana DeGette of Colorado raises an Amnesty International report describing misogynistic abuse of women on Twitter. Does Twitter have reports of abuse based on demographics? Does Twitter have data on actions it has taken? Dorsey: We don’t believe we can create a digital public square for people if they don’t feel safe to participate, and that is our number one priority. Dorsey says they do have data on abuse reports and intends to create a public transparency report. “We don’t feel it’s fair that the victims of harassment have to do the work to report it,” he says. “We think that we can reduce the amount of abuse and create technology to recognize it before a report has to be made.” Fred Upton, “My name is Fred Upton and I have to bet that my initials are used more than any other. I would like to see civility brought back into public discourse ... How do you determine whether a user is tweeting to manipulate or divide the conversation?” Dorsey explains how Twitter is using “health” as a metric for conversations. “Right now we’re trying to determine what the indicators of conversational health are.” They are trying to figure out how to define and measure things like shared attention, shared facts, and variety of perspective. Dorsey also acknowledges that there is confusion around Twitter’s rules. Pallone asks if Twitter will do a civil rights audit with a third-party, and Dorsey says yes. Pallone: How many human content moderators do you employ in the US and how much do they get paid? Dorsey: We don’t like to think about it that way. Pallone also asks what their training is and whether they are instructed that politicians and celebrities should be treated the same. Dorsey says he’ll follow up on specific numbers. Dorsey: I do believe we should do more around protecting private individuals than we do to public figures. Pallone: I think it’s the height of hypocrisy that Trump and Republicans criticize Twitter for supposed bias. Pallone says Twitter has an obligation to ensure that at a minimum, it does no harm. He complains that the rules are unevenly enforced. Walden: Why does Twitter rely on users to report violations? Dorsey: This is a matter of scale... Unspoken here is that Twitter doesn’t necessarily have the financial wherewithal to go on a massive hiring spree for content moderators, the way that Google and Facebook have. Walden jumps into questioning about this “shadowban” issue, again. Why did this only happen to certain accounts, he asks. Dorsey: We use signals, hundreds of signals, to determine what to downrank and what to filter. We were using a signal of the behavior of people *following* accounts. Dorsey says that this signal impacted 600,000 accounts, so it wasn’t just a handful of Republicans who were affected, as one might be led to believe by the way this issue has been beaten to death. Dorsey addresses the “shadowbanning” scandal, which was actually an issue of certain accounts not appearing in auto-complete results. More from the opening statement: “Our early and strong defense of open and free exchange has enabled Twitter to be THE platform for activists, marginalized communities, whistleblowers, journalists, governments and the most influential people around the world. Twitter will always default to open and free exchange. A default to free expression left unchecked can generate risks and dangers for people. It’s important Twitter distinguishes between people’s opinions and behaviors, and disarms behavior intending to silence another person, or adversely interfere with their universal human rights.” Jack Dorsey is now offering his opening statement: As he did this morning, he is reading the statement off his phone and simultaneously tweet-storming it. Here’s the beginning of the Twitter thread: Pallone: This hearing appears to be just one more mechanism to raise money and generate outrage. Nevertheless, Pallone says, Twitter has issues and should be better at dealing with misinformation and abuse. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the Democratic ranking member, begins his opening statement by criticizing Trump for drumming up “conspiracy theories” about Twitter. He says he hopes this hearing won’t focus on that. And then Walden gets to the “but...”, raising Vice New’s specious report about “shadowbanning” in July. Here’s our article addressing the “shadowban” theory, and explaining what was actually happening. Chairman Greg Walden is opening things up by talking about how important Twitter is. He references the Arab Spring and calls the service “truly revolutionary in the way the Gutenberg press was revolutionary”. Ok we’re getting underway! We’re now waiting for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s hearing to begin. They’re running a bit behind schedule. Directly after this morning’s hearing ended, the Department of Justice announced that attorney general Jeff Sessions “has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.” Another major issue, especially for Senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, was the degree to which Facebook, Twitter and Google should be aligned with American interests. Rubio pressed Sandberg and Dorsey to “link your company to the values of this country” and pressed them not to comply with request from “authoritarian regimes”. Looming over the hearing were recent reports that Google is working on a censored version of its search engine in order to re-enter China. By failing to attend the hearing, Google avoided awkward questions about those plans, but also lost any chance to defend itself. Meanwhile Facebook, which is no less interested in capturing the Chinese market, got the opportunity to appear principled and transparent by comparison. “We would only operate in a country if we could do so in keeping with our values, and that includes China,” Sandberg said. This liveblog got under way a little late, so we missed some key exchanges between the lawmakers and tech executives. Ron Wyden, one of the more tech-savvy senators, spent most of his time discussing the nexus between personal data and national security, saying “personal data is now the weapon of choice for political influence campaigns” and charging tech companies to “not make it easier for our adversaries to seize these weapons and use them against us”. Wyden also pressed Sandberg on Facebook ads designed to suppress voting – the Trump campaign reportedly targeted African American voters with messages designed to discourage them from voting in the 2016 election. Sandberg said “that activity has no place on Facebook”, but did not provide any specifics of how Facebook could detect or prohibit such ads, or whether they are technically against the company’s terms of service. Sandberg also struggled with pointed questions from Kamala Harris, who referenced a 2017 ProPublica report on how Facebook polices content, which revealed that the company treats white men as a protected class but not black children. The distinction in question stemmed from Facebook’s awkward efforts to define protected classes based on certain characteristics (gender) but not others (age). “That was badly written policy,” Sandberg said. She claimed that Facebook “fixed it” after publication of the article, but could not provide details. Sandberg is now off the hook, but Dorsey has another hearing today. He’ll testify before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in a hearing that is likely to focus more on partisan political issues than the one that just concluded. In his prepared remarks for the House committee, which were published yesterday, Dorsey emphasized Twitter’s neutrality, saying: “Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules. We believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially. We do not shadowban anyone based on political ideology.” The House committee gets underway at 1:30pm Eastern, and we’ll be following along. The hearing is adjourned. My quick take: This was a fairly congenial hearing, with senators largely emphasizing their desire to work together with tech companies, and Dorsey and Sandberg taking pains to emphasize how much they want to cooperate as well. The absence of Google provided a convenient whipping boy for the senators, and a contrast for Dorsey and Sandberg, who got to look transparent and accountable in contrast. Ultimately, there was not much new information, but it was interesting to see Sandberg and Dorsey engage on this stage for the first time. Burr is now offering closing remarks. He notes that the Russian influence operation was against the American people, not the American government. “There is a very human component to this. No single algorithm can fix the problem. Social media is a part of our life. It serves as the family newsletter... Unfortunately other states are now using the Russian playbook. We’re at a critical inflection point. Will using social media to sow discord become an acceptable form of statecraft? Your companies must be at the forefront of combatting those issues.” Warner is providing some closing remarks: I think we’re going to see more cases where misinformation actually incites violence. He raises the specter of violence like in Myanmar occurring elsewhere. Burr asks Sandberg and Dorsey to let him know if there are ways the government can work better with them. Reed: Do you believe that your users should have the right to control what you do with their data. Sandberg: Yes, very strongly, it’s your information. (There are many, many caveats to any assurances from Facebook that users have any control over their data. But Sandberg delivers the Facebook talking points much more believably than Mark Zuckerberg does.) Reed is asking why Twitter doesn’t label bots, which is an issue Warner already brought up. Dorsey notes that some of the bots are still difficult to identify because they mimic human activity. So if they label some bots, it might fool users into thinking that every account that isn’t labeled is a bot. Sandberg: We’re committed to working with you on it. Jack Reed asks if the government is working with them to combat election interference, giving Dorsey and Sandberg a chance to praise them. Cotton: Why does Facebook allow Wikileaks and Julian Assange? Sandberg: I’m nog going to defend Wikileaks and Julian Assange. Wikileaks is public and it doesn’t violate our terms of service. Dorsey: We also haven’t found violations of terms of service, but we are open to law enforcement insight that would tell us that there has been a violation. Cotton asks Dorsey if he prefers to see the US remain the dominant world power. Dorsey is dodging that question, and trying to thread a needle of being “consistent” with following its own terms of service when it comes to dealing with government requests. Senator Tom Cotton: Both of you should wear it as a badge of honor that you are blocked in China. Cotton criticizes Google for “cooperating” with “the Chinese Communist Party” (via device maker Huawei) while simultaneously reportedly taking steps to build a censored search engine for China and backing away from working on weaponized AI for the US government. This is... complicated, and Cotton’s statement is beyond questionable. But Google’s failure to show up for this hearing is allowing Twitter and Facebook to look much more ~patriotic~ than Google. Manchin: But do you all feel any responsibility? He raises the prospect of passing some kind of law akin to SESTA/FOSTA to limit the CDA Section 230 safe harbor clause and make internet platforms more liable for drug sales. Manchin: Why are you not doing business in China? Both say: We are blocked. Sandberg: The Chinese government blocked us... In order to go into China we would have to be able to do so without sacrificing our values and that’s not possible to do right now. Manchin says that prosecutors are looking to hold drug dealers are responsible for the deaths of drug users. He asks to what extent platforms bear responsibility for deaths of drug users if they die from drugs bought on platform. Sandberg and Dorsey are silent for a long moment, before Sandberg jumps in to say that the sale of drugs on the platform is against policy. She then adds that FB is cracking down on predatory drug rehab centers. Dorsey: We are looking deeply at how this information and activity spreads so we can shut it down. Joe Manchin of West Virginia brings up the illegal sale of opiates on Facebook and Twitter. He says the tools used for these sales are similar to those that are used by Russian influence operations. Lankford asks about WhatsApp. Sandberg: We are strong believers in encryption. Encryption helps keep people safe. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose fake news broadcast Infowars was recently banned from Facebook, is present at the hearing. He apparently had a testy exchange with Marco Rubio in the hallway. Senator James Lankford is also concerned about “deep fakes”. “Americans typically can trust what they say and suddenly in video they can no longer trust what they see.” Angus King asks about the line between providing context and true information, and censoring. “I’d hate to see your platforms become political in the sense that you’re censoring any one side.” Dorsey says Twitter “defaults to freedom of expression.” “We need to understand when that default interferes with other fundamental rights”, such as freedom from harm. Angus King asks about deep fakes. Is there a technological way that you can determine that a video has been manipulated and tag it? Sandberg: Deep fakes is a new area, and as always we’re going to do a combination of investing in technology and investing in people. There’s a pretty substantial contrast between Dorsey’s and Sandberg’s tones today. Sandberg is fairly upbeat in defending Facebook and its various efforts to address serious issues. Dorsey is taking a more confessional tone, referring repeatedly to his company’s failures. Blunt asks Dorsey what is the business downside of working on these issues. A backdrop to this question is that Twitter’s stock price has dropped significantly during this hearing. One reason for that may be Dorsey’s repeated statements that Twitter is considering making “tectonic shifts” in how it incentivizes user behavior. Roy Blunt is questioning Sheryl Sandberg: “What’s the big challenge about being at the forefront of trying to figure this out from a business perspective?” Sandberg: “We have been investing very heavily in people, in our systems, and I that’s what you’re seeing pay off. Sandberg praises “tighter coordination” between social media companies, government, and law enforcement to combat foreign interference. Welcome to our live coverage of executives from Facebook and Twitter are testifying before Congress. This is their latest attempt to assure lawmakers that they are capable of protecting the upcoming midterm elections from foreign interference – but the loudest message so far may have come from Google, which is represented by an empty chair. “The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end,” warned Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in his opening remarks. “Where we go from here now is an open question.” The hearing is the fourth in a series examining how social media platforms have evolved from fun time-wasters into what committee chair Senator Richard Burr called “a threat to our democracy”. “Clearly this problem is not going away; I’m not even sure it’s trending in the right direction,” Burr said of the threat to US elections from foreign influence operations on social media platforms. “What happened in the 2016 election cycle was unacceptable,” said Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg in prepared remarks. “We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. That’s on us … We are learning from what happened, and we are improving.” Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter, also acknowledged his company’s past failures. “Abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter bubbles – that‘s not a healthy public square,” he said in opening remarks. “We acknowledge the real-world negative consequences of what happened, and we take full responsibility to fix it.” Google, which declined to send CEO Sundar Pichai or co-founder and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, was notably absent, an empty chair and nameplate providing a constant visual reminder of the snub. The company sought to send senior vice president for global affairs Kent Walker, but was rebuffed. “I’m deeply disappointed that Google – one of the most influential digital platforms in the world – chose not to send its own top corporate leadership to engage this committee,” said Warner. “Given its size and influence, I would have thought the leadership at Google would want to demonstrate how seriously it takes these challenges and to actually take a leadership role in this important public discussion.”"

          "headline": "Brexit, Brexit, Brexit: leaders on autopilot for return of PMQs",
          "bodyText": "No one can say that Theresa May doesn't go out of her way to make things easy for Jeremy Corbyn. There was a time in their early exchanges at prime minister's questions when the Labour leader frequently failed to follow his own line of thinking and managed to confuse himself as well as his opposite number. But after some coaching from May, whose inner hopelessness one cannot help but admire, Corbyn has learned he really only has to repeat the same one-line question over and over again. Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. Neither May nor Corbyn looked exactly rested for their first PMQs of the new parliamentary session – the summer months haven't been kind to either of them – but the Labour leader is rather more convincing when operating on autopilot than the prime minister. He forced an eye open, asked which of her ministers she agreed with over Brexit, and sat down. The prime minister looked panic-stricken and immediately went into damage limitation mode. She actually agreed with all of her cabinet, even though they were all saying completely different things. Call it collective irresponsibility. She was aiming to get a good deal, but things wouldn't be so terrible if she got a bad one. Think of it this way: back in 1918, 100 million people had died of Spanish flu and it hadn't been the end of the world. And she wasn't anticipating a death toll on anything like this scale: 20 million at the very most. What's more, a no-deal Brexit offered a whole range of exciting job opportunities. Undertakers, black marketeers, Portaloo operators on the M20. Even Bernard Matthews was enthusiastic about a no-deal. Great. Now the turkeys were voting for Brexit. While there was some irony in Corbyn lecturing May on not having a clue about what she was doing on Brexit – the Labour leader has hardly been a model of clarity – the prime minister still struggled to come up with a credible response. She tried muttering “antisemitism” a few times as a diversionary tactic, but mostly she switched to her default monotone algorithm of wanting a deep and special partnership. Finding one with herself would be a start. Her backbenchers looked miserable. When she switches to Maybot, it's invariably game over. As if anticipating her own mediocrity, May had arranged to give a statement on the Salisbury poisonings immediately after PMQs. The prime minister almost always does well on these occasions – she can do a nice line in sounding like a serious leader on most things other than Brexit and the Conservative party – and she was helped this time by having something interesting to say. Which seemed to come as much of a surprise to her as to everyone else. Usually these occasions are much ado about nothing but it turned out that the police weren't quite as useless as she had suspected. They had identified the killers as two Russian agents from the GRU who had sprayed novichok around an east London hotel – the kiss of death for that establishment – before finding a train service that hadn't been cancelled to take them down to Wiltshire to poison the Skripals. May went on to praise the European Union for standing up to the Russians – she didn't pause to wonder why we were so hellbent on leaving an institution that was so supportive – before announcing that although there was no point applying for an extradition order, she had issued a European arrest warrant for the two suspects. In hindsight, this might have been a mistake. After Brexit, it could turn out that the UK is the one place in Europe where the Russians can't be arrested. The Labour benches had made a point of emptying before the prime minister had begun her statement. A silent protest against their own leader, whom they reckon to be a liability on security matters. Under the circumstances, Corbyn acquitted himself quite well. He was never going to go the full “I hate all the Russkies, they're a load of crazy commies”, which was all that would have satisfied many of his own MPs, but he did admit that the evidence was compelling and that the actions of the Russians should be condemned. “Typical weaselly words,” bellowed Boris Johnson, showing no signs of having listened to the Labour leader and choosing instead to give the speech he had prepared earlier. It takes a weasel to know a weasel."

          "headline": "Yes, Silicon Valley needs regulation. But Trump’s reason why is misguided",
          "bodyText": "In a head-turning move that has pitted him squarely against Silicon Valley’s most revered companies, Donald Trump proclaimed last week that algorithms developed by the likes of Google and Facebook fail to offer consumers politically-balanced news about American politics and his presidency itself. The underlying insinuation was that firms like Google, in designing features like search engine results pages and the algorithms that power them, perpetuate a kind of bias against conservative media in the US. His message, in all its brashness, was very clear: that there is an insidious suppression of certain kinds of US news outlets, and that should the internet platform companies fail to address it, the president himself will do so throhesiugh the power vested in him – including, potentially, by levying heavy-handed regulation. Trump might indeed be right that this industry deserves some kind of up-regulation. But his premise for that policymaking conclusion – that internet companies knowingly suppress conservative content – could not be more off-point and misguided. We must first acknowledge the effects that have raised Trump’s ire. As the president suggests, it’s most likely true that, in most cases, a consumer who searches for “Trump news” on Google will see links to news stories that are produced and published by what Trump regards as “fake” news outlets – his parlance for traditionally liberal media sources; among the typical top results, one might find outlets such as CNN under Google’s present algorithm. Trump may have noticed similar effects on such platforms as Facebook and Twitter – namely, that they at times appear to give preference to the news produced by American newspapers traditionally associated with liberal viewpoints among the editorial boards, like the New York Times or the Washington Post. Indeed, conservatives ranging from the far right to former Facebook contractors to sitting US senators have accused the internet companies – and particularly Facebook – of perpetuating and enforcing this form of anti-conservative bias for the past several years now. And though difficult to verify, it is also probably true that most companies in Silicon Valley – including all the major brand names the president implicated last week – continue to employ many, many more liberals than conservatives within their ranks. This might be so much the case that at certain companies, conservatism itself feels taboo, viciously reinforcing the uncomfortable idea that the Valley is only for Democrats. All of those are real things that conservatives justly feel. They are right to voice their tremendous concern about these social issues. No one should feel uncomfortable about their political beliefs so long as those beliefs are not overtly harmful to others. But we have to be very careful before ascribing such insidious motivations and behaviors to the technology firms as the president has done. There is a far simpler explanation for all of this: that the companies are simply showing us what they think we’re likeliest to want to see, because that’s what is most in their business interest. We must keep in mind the business model that is at play here. The commercial success for each of the aforementioned internet companies is entirely premised on their ability to recommend highly engaging content to the user. Tailoring the content that a user sees based on his or her personal preferences – as inferred through analysis of the vast stores of personal data that companies like Facebook and Google collect on individual users – is the modus operandi for this sector. Each of the firms wishes to recommend the most predictably engaging content tailored to each individual because doing so keeps the user scrolling down news feeds, clicking through YouTube video playlists, and scanning search results for longer periods of time– and that in turn helps the platform companies sell more ad space so that marketers can find and target users with ads about their products and services. It is a commercial regime that rewards engaging content, and that means that platform companies simply don’t care about the nature of the content as a general matter, let alone its political leaning. As long as the content isn’t offensive or harmful in some explicit way, they’re usually just fine with it. The primary variable that they optimize for is the number of clicks on that content: only that approach, not political censoring, will contribute most effectively to the bottom line. Pairing this reality of the market with the fact that there are simply fewer legitimate conservative political news media outlets in the United States than there are liberal ones, we begin to see the difficult tension that faces the industry. Silicon Valley is being accused of liberal bias, when in fact the evidence that conservatives point to is only a manifestation of the American political culture itself. That the algorithms recommend certain political news sources instead of others on Google – such as CNN over Breitbart, NBC over Fox, or the New York Times over the New York Post – is an artifact of the modern American culture itself, more so than any sort of nefarious proactive or oblivious suppression of politically conservative content. If certain outlets are being favored over others, it is likely because they are more trustworthy to the average reader. That might be because they are more factual or fact-based (or both) in their reporting. Similarly, if certain types of people are hired more often by the industry than others, it is likely because the American culture itself is so designed as to promote and perpetuate that bias – in the same way that women and minorities also have much lower representation in the Valley. These are effects that certainly deserve attention and policy change, but to claim political bias pervades the tech giants’ talent search is a stretch. After all, we should also keep in mind that the internet platforms are just that – neutral platforms. They work hard to execute on their promise of political neutrality. And they do so not necessarily out of the goodness of their hearts, but rather for their shareholders. If they don’t protect their neutrality with vigor, their profitability itself risks some curtailing by virtue of governmental intervention and regulation of speech. But after his diatribe against the tech industry for all its supposed political bias, Trump slipped in another important remark last week: that antitrust is, perhaps, the answer to dealing with such companies as Amazon, Facebook and Google. And while he may have taken an illogical and circuitous route to arrive at that conclusion, the conclusion itself may nevertheless be true. This is an industry that has grown quickly and, after a matter of a few years, concentrated its commercial power into a constellation of a handful of powerful behemoths. And while there is nothing necessarily wrong with a company becoming large, the American public, among certain other global constituents, has witnessed the evolution of a set of vicious negative externalities that have overrun the leading internet platforms. The paucity of competition in the sector forms the foundation of the problem at hand; without the pressure of an earnest rival, a company like Facebook, in the absence of government regulation, is less likely to take content down, even if it clearly violates corporate policies addressing hate speech, political disinformation, fake news, discriminatory material, or other malicious content. Doing so cuts into its business. This persistant, emblematic hesitation – which we saw rear its head again last month in the case of the Alex Jones takedowns – suggests that regulation may be needed to correct the system. Americans – and the global citizenry that cares about fairness and truth – do indeed require a far more robust policy framework to contain and extinguish the hideous outgrowths of the commercial internet. This will not be easy. It will necessitate grafting an information system that truly puts the sanctity of the truth above all else – including any competing commercial or political interests. But this is the step we must now take to protect our democracies. Dipayan Ghosh is the Pozen fellow at the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School.

          "bodyText": "It is an iron law of the internet that any attempt to censor or suppress information will inevitably result in the increased dissemination of that information. Just as the laws of thermodynamics undergird everything we know and can learn about the physical world, this rule – known as the Streisand Effect – sets the table for every debate around speech on the internet. It was thus only to be expected that when Facebook, YouTube and other internet platforms decided to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s fake news broadcasts in early August, Infowars’ traffic and reach would only increase. “The more I’m persecuted, the stronger I get,” Jones reportedly said in response to the mass banning. “It backfired.” But a new report by the New York Times suggests that, in fact, traffic to Infowars’ website and video broadcasts has fallen precipitously in the wake of his banishment from Facebook and YouTube. According to the Times’ analysis, Jones’ reach went from 1.4 million visitors each day to just 715,000, and a temporary spike in traffic to the Infowars website did not replace the approximately 900,000 video views that Facebook and YouTube were responsible for each day for the three weeks before the bans. (Jones disputed the Times’ analysis on Twitter, a platform that bucked the trend of banning Jones, but also has a significantly smaller reach than YouTube or Facebook.) That the de-platforming of Alex Jones is reducing the number of people exposed to his particularly noxious brew of conspiracy theories, hate mongering, misinformation, harassment and other bile on a daily basis is certainly welcome news. But before we give Facebook and YouTube too much credit for reducing Jones’ reach, it’s important to look at the equation from the other side: until one month ago, Facebook and YouTube combined were apparently responsible for doubling Infowars’ audience. They were not just serving as passive platforms, hosting content for those who sought it out. They were placing Infowars before the eyeballs of people who would not otherwise consume it, and they were making money off that transaction. “I think that what is reflected in the traffic going down is related to the power of social media to broadcast content to new audiences,” said Joan Donovan, a lead researcher at Data &amp; Society’s Media Manipulation Initiative. “What we are seeing now is more of a reflection of the fanbase as it stands rather than a reflection of how the recommendation algorithm is serving the content to new audiences.” In other words, Alex Jones was a small man, standing on the shoulders of internet giants in order to punch above his weight. The symbiotic relationship between Infowars and the social media platforms was particularly potent because of the platforms’ incentive structure (they want to keep people on their platforms where they will watch advertisements) and the algorithms they use to achieve that objective. Rather than expecting users to actively seek out information or entertainment, Facebook and YouTube feeds them an algorithmically determined stream of whatever content the algorithms calculate is most likely to keep the user from clicking away. “These algorithms work really well if you are into a subculture of music or really love scented candles and want to watch reviews of scented candles,” Donovan said. “It’s not problematic because you are seeing the things you are interested in, you consume it, and you move on with your day.” “But when you’re doing it with news, it does have a different effect on political polarization,” Donovan added. “If you’re looking at extremist videos, particularly stuff related to the alt-right, [the algorithm] sees that you typed in that keyword, and it wants to keep serving you stuff related to that keyword.” Donovan said that Infowars was particularly suited to Facebook’s and YouTube’s algorithms, because they are looking for “freshness and relevance”. Jones broadcasts for hours each day, and Infowars then slices and dices his rants into short videos designed for social media platforms. “It really tips the recommendation system towards Infowars because they have content about almost everything you can imagine, as well as having content that is new online,” she said. “Very few media makers can produce at that kind of rate online.” Indeed, since publication of the Times’ article on Tuesday morning, Infowars has shared at least five videos disputing it on Twitter. Facebook and YouTube are, of course, not solely responsible for amplifying Jones and his ilk. The traditional media are also grappling with the question of how best to cover the alt-right and other extremists, many of whom court media attention in order to hijack our platforms for their own ends. Monday’s contretemps over the New Yorker’s (since retracted) decision to invite white nationalist Steve Bannon to headline its annual ideas festival was just one example of how frequently the traditional news media err. But more editors and journalists are discussing ideas such as “strategic silence” and publications at the very least take responsibility for their editorial decisions, rather than blaming an algorithm, or their readers. “It is possible to have an ethic and a process of social media moderation that mirrors the ethic and practice of journalists,” Donovan said. “If [the internet platforms] had paid attention to Alex Jones when he hit 10,000 followers, or 20,000, or 50,000, and done consistent content review to understand if the content contained conspiracy theories or targeted harassment, they then would have had a handle on the issue, and it wouldn’t have ballooned into this PR crisis.”"

          "bodyText": "From Swinging London to the New Romantics, music and fashion have long gone together like mum jeans and a breton top. These days, thanks to Kanye West’s Yeezys, grime music’s tracksuit fever and the grunge aesthetic channelled by everyone from Saint Laurent to Urban Outfitters, it’s a bond that is tighter than ever. Unsurprisingly, then, there’s an app for that, one which aims to distill your music taste into style tips. The catchily-titled Eison Triple Thread works like this: once downloaded, it matches the user’s most-listened-to Spotify tracks with inspiration boards and then generates suggestions of items to buy. In short, it takes a song and converts it into insights on an artist. “So a guy who was born between 1984 and 1988, likes hip-hop and works in tech in San Francisco will probably like clothing that’s on-trend,” founder Julian Eison said earlier this year. “And people who listen to 60s music like the Beatles will have suggestions like high-rise jeans and corduroy.” The catch is the clothes are all manufactured by the company and, currently, it’s open only to men in the US, which could feel sexist if it weren’t for the fact that culture repeatedly emphasises the fact that many men struggle with their personal style (see: Queer Eye). Eison’s methodology is simple: “When people go to concerts, they tend to dress like the other concertgoers or emulate the artist.” But while his reasoning works to an extent – most British indie gigs are still a sea of plaid shirts, skinny jeans and Doc Martens, with festival fashion now its own summery, Little Mix-esque niche – it does feel like an oversimplification. He is, however, keen to emphasise that his algorithm isn’t as simple as merely selling an artist’s image back to their fans. Rather, it aims to “try and understand why [someone is] listening to that artist, and understand their relationship to style”. But is funnelling the bands we listen to into Instagram-worthy looks really a replacement for the awkward joy of figuring out your own style? For me, it’s a phase and a challenge I remember fondly, from poorly dyed red hair that ended up more Ronald McDonald than Shirley Manson, to a Madonna-in-the-Guy-Ritchie-years tweed flat cap, to the jeans tighter than Pete Doherty’s in 2002. One particularly bad era, around the release of Avril Lavigne’s debut album, involved white vest tops that were actually just M&amp;S pyjamas (although perhaps I was merely ahead of the sleepwear-as-daywear trend). Nowadays, I claim to have a vaguely grunge aesthetic, though 90% of my wardrobe is from the Oxford Street branch of Topshop, so my rock credentials come veiled in substantial amounts of polyester. Douglas Greenwood, a journalist covering music and fashion for i-D magazine, believes that the relationship between both disciplines is actually stronger than ever. He notes that most big brands “have got to where they are not by being highly respected by other fashion designers but more so by the clout they get from having major figures in the music industry wear their stuff”. He also cites the labels that have benefitted from their relationship with musicians, among them Dior Homme’s Kim Jones (A$AP Rocky) and Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh (Kanye West), the latter of which also appointed the fashion house’s first music director, British DJ Benji B. However, he is dubious of trying to reduce the relationship to algorithms. “There’s a difference between stylists and personal style that’s put together for you by a computer that says here’s how to dress if you listen to folk, or trap or bubblegum pop,” he says. “You sort of risk piling all those people into the wrong categories, and hypebeast [streetwear fans who will do anything to be ahead of the curve] culture seeping into every other genre of music.” Another thing to consider: is everyone’s dress sense inspired by their music taste anyway? I’m thinking of people such as my friend Josie, who listens almost exclusively to rap but dresses in 50s-style boatneck dresses and is often asked whether she’s French because pourquoi non? (Little do strangers know her favourite song is by Lil Wayne.) Sure, there’s my friend Penny, who recently cut all her hair off and bleached the stubble white prior to a sabbatical in Berlin where she listened to techno every night, but I feel like it’s the sort of bold stylistic move she would have gone for regardless. And what of those folk who claim not to listen to anything but Ed Sheeran? Band T-shirts, another big trend of recent times, can include merch (think Justin Bieber’s Vetements-aping designs or Lorde’s vintage movie poster-style tees), but are often more closely linked with high-fashion inspo (ie Nicolas Ghesquière kicking off the trend by channelling Iron Maiden at Balenciaga back in 2012) and disposable high-street fashion iterations. Even if your music does influence your taste, not everything is without controversy. “I think, as a queer person, your relationship with [rap] and that kind of dressing can be skewed because [the genre is] inherently homophobic,” Greenwood adds. This in itself is a controversial area; while historically true, the rise of queer rap, from Frank Ocean to Brockhampton, definitely makes the distinction less clear cut than it might have once been. As the relationship between music and fashion changes and evolves, it seems technology could provide a novel jumping-off point, without replacing our tastemaking skills altogether. “It’s a conversation and a relationship with the user we’re building over time,” Eison says. “It’s not as simple as associating a style with an artist.” So, the next time you’re trying to pick the perfect outfit, perhaps look instead to your playlist, and pray that all those days spent listening to the Mamma Mia II soundtrack don’t translate into sequinned Spandex."

          "headline": "'Jewtropolis': antisemitic hack hits map used by Snapchat and Citi Bike",
          "bodyText": "On Thursday morning, some users of the maps functionality on Snapchat were shocked to see New York labelled “Jewtropolis”. Users of the bike-rental scheme Citi Bike, the real estate website StreetEasy and the Weather Channel website saw the same thing. No one at any of those companies appears to be responsible. Instead the blame lies with Mapbox, a third-party company that provides maps for online brands. Mapbox relies partly on user-provided data, and while there are supposed to be checks in place to prevent abuse of the system, it seems a prankster had managed to get through them and give New York a new antisemitic moniker, albeit one that was changed within an hour once moderators had spotted it. In a statement, Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, said the defacement was “deeply offensive”. Mapbox called it “malicious hate speech” and a “disgusting attack” and said they were reviewing how it could have happened. Yet this is far from the first shot to be fired in the war of the maps apps. You could be forgiven for thinking that online maps are one of the least controversial parts of the internet. Yes, social media may be rife with abuse, bullying and fake news, but apps like Google Maps and Waze appear to be objective, useful services. On the internet, though, things are never be that simple. Although services like Google and Mapbox use a wide range of data sources including Ordnance Survey maps, information from federal and local governments and location data, they also rely in part on submissions from the public – and that’s where trouble can begin brewing. Some of these hacks are relatively harmless. After some senators suggested renaming the Russell Office Building in the Senate after John McCain earlier this week, an enthusiastic well-wisher managed to rename the building on Google Maps before any official decision had been made, changing the block to the “McCain Senate Office Building”. Google Maps has since reversed the change. But most of the hacks are a lot more pernicious. During Barack Obama’s presidency, for example, there were times when searching for the racist terms “nigger house” or “nigger king”, when focused on Washington DC, would immediately show you information for the White House. People also hack maps features as a means of protest. Serbian Crown, a Washington DC restaurant which served controversial meats including lion and alligator, suddenly found one weekend that business had dropped off, with the owner estimating a 75% reduction in customers. This continued for months, and the restaurant had to lay off staff and make cutbacks. Eventually they realised that their opening hours had been changed on Google, so it appeared the restaurant was closed on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. By the time they were able to get it changed it was too late and the restaurant was forced to close. The owner later tried unsuccessfully to sue Google. There are thousands of other fake businesses, faulty information and jokes on maps services, some a form of political protest, but most are just personal in-jokes. But because the algorithm Google and others use to populate maps are a mystery, it’s often difficult to get things changed when mistakes are spotted. On at least one occasion, though, Google was extremely quick to make changes. In 2015, an area of woodland in Pakistan briefly displayed the logo of Google’s Android software urinating on the Apple logo. Once discovered, Google decided not to keep the design as an emblem of their market dominance in the maps arena, and the image was quickly removed."

          "bodyText": "The 18th of March 2018, was the day tech insiders had been dreading. That night, a new moon added almost no light to a poorly lit four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona, as a specially adapted Uber Volvo XC90 detected an object ahead. Part of the modern gold rush to develop self-driving vehicles, the SUV had been driving autonomously, with no input from its human backup driver, for 19 minutes. An array of radar and light-emitting lidar sensors allowed onboard algorithms to calculate that, given their host vehicle’s steady speed of 43mph, the object was six seconds away – assuming it remained stationary. But objects in roads seldom remain stationary, so more algorithms crawled a database of recognizable mechanical and biological entities, searching for a fit from which this one’s likely behavior could be inferred. At first the computer drew a blank; seconds later, it decided it was dealing with another car, expecting it to drive away and require no special action. Only at the last second was a clear identification found – a woman with a bike, shopping bags hanging confusingly from handlebars, doubtless assuming the Volvo would route around her as any ordinary vehicle would. Barred from taking evasive action on its own, the computer abruptly handed control back to its human master, but the master wasn’t paying attention. Elaine Herzberg, aged 49, was struck and killed, leaving more reflective members of the tech community with two uncomfortable questions: was this algorithmic tragedy inevitable? And how used to such incidents would we, should we, be prepared to get? “In some ways we’ve lost agency. When programs pass into code and code passes into algorithms and then algorithms start to create new algorithms, it gets farther and farther from human agency. Software is released into a code universe which no one can fully understand.” If these words sound shocking, they should, not least because Ellen Ullman, in addition to having been a distinguished professional programmer since the 1970s, is one of the few people to write revealingly about the process of coding. There’s not much she doesn’t know about software in the wild. “People say, ‘Well, what about Facebook – they create and use algorithms and they can change them.’ But that’s not how it works. They set the algorithms off and they learn and change and run themselves. Facebook intervene in their running periodically, but they really don’t control them. And particular programs don’t just run on their own, they call on libraries, deep operating systems and so on ...” What is an algorithm? Few subjects are more constantly or fervidly discussed right now than algorithms. But what is an algorithm? In fact, the usage has changed in interesting ways since the rise of the internet – and search engines in particular – in the mid-1990s. At root, an algorithm is a small, simple thing; a rule used to automate the treatment of a piece of data. If a happens, then do b; if not, then do c. This is the “if/then/else” logic of classical computing. If a user claims to be 18, allow them into the website; if not, print “Sorry, you must be 18 to enter”. At core, computer programs are bundles of such algorithms. Recipes for treating data. On the micro level, nothing could be simpler. If computers appear to be performing magic, it’s because they are fast, not intelligent. Recent years have seen a more portentous and ambiguous meaning emerge, with the word “algorithm” taken to mean any large, complex decision-making software system; any means of taking an array of input – of data – and assessing it quickly, according to a given set of criteria (or “rules”). This has revolutionized areas of medicine, science, transport, communication, making it easy to understand the utopian view of computing that held sway for many years. Algorithms have made our lives better in myriad ways. Only since 2016 has a more nuanced consideration of our new algorithmic reality begun to take shape. If we tend to discuss algorithms in almost biblical terms, as independent entities with lives of their own, it’s because we have been encouraged to think of them in this way. Corporations like Facebook and Google have sold and defended their algorithms on the promise of objectivity, an ability to weigh a set of conditions with mathematical detachment and absence of fuzzy emotion. No wonder such algorithmic decision-making has spread to the granting of loans/ bail/benefits/college places/job interviews and almost anything requiring choice. We no longer accept the sales pitch for this type of algorithm so meekly. In her 2016 book Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil, a former math prodigy who left Wall Street to teach and write and run the excellent mathbabe blog, demonstrated beyond question that, far from eradicating human biases, algorithms could magnify and entrench them. After all, software is written by overwhelmingly affluent white and Asian men – and it will inevitably reflect their assumptions (Google “racist soap dispenser” to see how this plays out in even mundane real-world situations). Bias doesn’t require malice to become harm, and unlike a human being, we can’t easily ask an algorithmic gatekeeper to explain its decision. O’Neil called for “algorithmic audits” of any systems directly affecting the public, a sensible idea that the tech industry will fight tooth and nail, because algorithms are what the companies sell; the last thing they will volunteer is transparency. The good news is that this battle is under way. The bad news is that it’s already looking quaint in relation to what comes next. So much attention has been focused on the distant promises and threats of artificial intelligence, AI, that almost no one has noticed us moving into a new phase of the algorithmic revolution that could be just as fraught and disorienting – with barely a question asked. The algorithms flagged by O’Neil and others are opaque but predictable: they do what they’ve been programmed to do. A skilled coder can in principle examine and challenge their underpinnings. Some of us dream of a citizen army to do this work, similar to the network of amateur astronomers who support professionals in that field. Legislation to enable this seems inevitable. We might call these algorithms “dumb”, in the sense that they’re doing their jobs according to parameters defined by humans. The quality of result depends on the thought and skill with which they were programmed. At the other end of the spectrum is the more or less distant dream of human-like artificial general intelligence, or AGI. A properly intelligent machine would be able to question the quality of its own calculations, based on something like our own intuition (which we might think of as a broad accumulation of experience and knowledge). To put this into perspective, Google’s DeepMind division has been justly lauded for creating a program capable of mastering arcade games, starting with nothing more than an instruction to aim for the highest possible score. This technique is called “reinforcement learning” and works because a computer can play millions of games quickly in order to learn what generates points. Some call this form of ability “artificial narrow intelligence”, but here the word “intelligent” is being used much as Facebook uses “friend” – to imply something safer and better understood than it is. Why? Because the machine has no context for what it’s doing and can’t do anything else. Neither, crucially, can it transfer knowledge from one game to the next (so-called “transfer learning”), which makes it less generally intelligent than a toddler, or even a cuttlefish. We might as well call an oil derrick or an aphid “intelligent”. Computers are already vastly superior to us at certain specialized tasks, but the day they rival our general ability is probably some way off – if it ever happens. Human beings may not be best at much, but we’re second-best at an impressive range of things. Here’s the problem. Between the “dumb” fixed algorithms and true AI lies the problematic halfway house we’ve already entered with scarcely a thought and almost no debate, much less agreement as to aims, ethics, safety, best practice. If the algorithms around us are not yet intelligent, meaning able to independently say “that calculation/course of action doesn’t look right: I’ll do it again”, they are nonetheless starting to learn from their environments. And once an algorithm is learning, we no longer know to any degree of certainty what its rules and parameters are. At which point we can’t be certain of how it will interact with other algorithms, the physical world, or us. Where the “dumb” fixed algorithms – complex, opaque and inured to real time monitoring as they can be – are in principle predictable and interrogable, these ones are not. After a time in the wild, we no longer know what they are: they have the potential to become erratic. We might be tempted to call these “frankenalgos” – though Mary Shelley couldn’t have made this up. Clashing codes These algorithms are not new in themselves. I first encountered them almost five years ago while researching a piece for the Guardian about high frequency trading (HFT) on the stock market. What I found was extraordinary: a human-made digital ecosystem, distributed among racks of black boxes crouched like ninjas in billion-dollar data farms – which is what stock markets had become. Where once there had been a physical trading floor, all action had devolved to a central server, in which nimble, predatory algorithms fed off lumbering institutional ones, tempting them to sell lower and buy higher by fooling them as to the state of the market. Human HFT traders (although no human actively traded any more) called these large, slow participants “whales”, and they mostly belonged to mutual and pension funds – ie the public. For most HFT shops, whales were now the main profit source. In essence, these algorithms were trying to outwit each other; they were doing invisible battle at the speed of light, placing and cancelling the same order 10,000 times per second or slamming so many into the system that the whole market shook – all beyond the oversight or control of humans. No one could be surprised that this situation was unstable. A “flash crash” had occurred in 2010, during which the market went into freefall for five traumatic minutes, then righted itself over another five – for no apparent reason. I travelled to Chicago to see a man named Eric Hunsader, whose prodigious programming skills allowed him to see market data in far more detail than regulators, and he showed me that by 2014, “mini flash crashes” were happening every week. Even he couldn’t prove exactly why, but he and his staff had begun to name some of the “algos” they saw, much as crop circle hunters named the formations found in English summer fields, dubbing them “Wild Thing”, “Zuma”, “The Click” or “Disruptor”. Neil Johnson, a physicist specializing in complexity at George Washington University, made a study of stock market volatility. “It’s fascinating,” he told me. “I mean, people have talked about the ecology of computer systems for years in a vague sense, in terms of worm viruses and so on. But here’s a real working system that we can study. The bigger issue is that we don’t know how it’s working or what it could give rise to. And the attitude seems to be ‘out of sight, out of mind’.” Significantly, Johnson’s paper on the subject was published in the journal Nature and described the stock market in terms of “an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized by frequent black swan [ie highly unusual] events with ultrafast durations”. The scenario was complicated, according to the science historian George Dyson, by the fact that some HFT firms were allowing the algos to learn – “just letting the black box try different things, with small amounts of money, and if it works, reinforce those rules. We know that’s been done. Then you actually have rules where nobody knows what the rules are: the algorithms create their own rules – you let them evolve the same way nature evolves organisms.” Non-finance industry observers began to postulate a catastrophic global “splash crash”, while the fastest-growing area of the market became (and remains) instruments that profit from volatility. In his 2011 novel The Fear Index, Robert Harris imagines the emergence of AGI – of the Singularity, no less – from precisely this digital ooze. To my surprise, no scientist I spoke to would categorically rule out such a possibility. All of which could be dismissed as high finance arcana, were it not for a simple fact. Wisdom used to hold that technology was adopted first by the porn industry, then by everyone else. But the 21st century’s porn is finance, so when I thought I saw signs of HFT-like algorithms causing problems elsewhere, I called Neil Johnson again. “You’re right on point,” he told me: a new form of algorithm is moving into the world, which has “the capability to rewrite bits of its own code”, at which point it becomes like “a genetic algorithm”. He thinks he saw evidence of them on fact-finding forays into Facebook (“I’ve had my accounts attacked four times,” he adds). If so, algorithms are jousting there, and adapting, as on the stock market. “After all, Facebook is just one big algorithm,” Johnson says. “And I think that’s exactly the issue Facebook has. They can have simple algorithms to recognize my face in a photo on someone else’s page, take the data from my profile and link us together. That’s a very simple concrete algorithm. But the question is what is the effect of billions of such algorithms working together at the macro level? You can’t predict the learned behavior at the level of the population from microscopic rules. So Facebook would claim that they know exactly what’s going on at the micro level, and they’d probably be right. But what happens at the level of the population? That’s the issue.” To underscore this point, Johnson and a team of colleagues from the University of Miami and Notre Dame produced a paper, Emergence of Extreme Subpopulations from Common Information and Likely Enhancement from Future Bonding Algorithms, purporting to mathematically prove that attempts to connect people on social media inevitably polarize society as a whole. He thinks Facebook and others should model (or be made to model) the effects of their algorithms in the way climate scientists model climate change or weather patterns. O’Neil says she consciously excluded this adaptive form of algorithm from Weapons of Math Destruction. In a convoluted algorithmic environment where nothing is clear, apportioning responsibility to particular segments of code becomes extremely difficult. This makes them easier to ignore or dismiss, because they and their precise effects are harder to identify, she explains, before advising that if I want to see them in the wild, I should ask what a flash crash on Amazon might look like. “I’ve been looking out for these algorithms, too,” she says, “and I’d been thinking: ‘Oh, big data hasn’t gotten there yet.’ But more recently a friend who’s a bookseller on Amazon has been telling me how crazy the pricing situation there has become for people like him. Every so often you will see somebody tweet ‘Hey, you can buy a luxury yarn on Amazon for $40,000.’ And whenever I hear that kind of thing, I think: ‘Ah! That must be the equivalent of a flash crash!’” Anecdotal evidence of anomalous events on Amazon is plentiful, in the form of threads from bemused sellers, and at least one academic paper from 2016, which claims: “Examples have emerged of cases where competing pieces of algorithmic pricing software interacted in unexpected ways and produced unpredictable prices, as well as cases where algorithms were intentionally designed to implement price fixing.” The problem, again, is how to apportion responsibility in a chaotic algorithmic environment where simple cause and effect either doesn’t apply or is nearly impossible to trace. As in finance, deniability is baked into the system. Real-life dangers Where safety is at stake, this really matters. When a driver ran off the road and was killed in a Toyota Camry after appearing to accelerate wildly for no obvious reason, Nasa experts spent six months examining the millions of lines of code in its operating system, without finding evidence for what the driver’s family believed had occurred, but the manufacturer steadfastly denied – that the car had accelerated of its own accord. Only when a pair of embedded software experts spent 20 months digging into the code were they able to prove the family’s case, revealing a twisted mass of what programmers call “spaghetti code”, full of algorithms that jostled and fought, generating anomalous, unpredictable output. The autonomous cars currently being tested may contain 100m lines of code and, given that no programmer can anticipate all possible circumstances on a real-world road, they have to learn and receive constant updates. How do we avoid clashes in such a fluid code milieu, not least when the algorithms may also have to defend themselves from hackers? Twenty years ago, George Dyson anticipated much of what is happening today in his classic book Darwin Among the Machines. The problem, he tells me, is that we’re building systems that are beyond our intellectual means to control. We believe that if a system is deterministic (acting according to fixed rules, this being the definition of an algorithm) it is predictable – and that what is predictable can be controlled. Both assumptions turn out to be wrong. “It’s proceeding on its own, in little bits and pieces,” he says. “What I was obsessed with 20 years ago that has completely taken over the world today are multicellular, metazoan digital organisms, the same way we see in biology, where you have all these pieces of code running on people’s iPhones, and collectively it acts like one multicellular organism. “There’s this old law called Ashby’s law that says a control system has to be as complex as the system it’s controlling, and we’re running into that at full speed now, with this huge push to build self-driving cars where the software has to have a complete model of everything, and almost by definition we’re not going to understand it. Because any model that we understand is gonna do the thing like run into a fire truck ’cause we forgot to put in the fire truck.” Unlike our old electro-mechanical systems, these new algorithms are also impossible to test exhaustively. Unless and until we have super-intelligent machines to do this for us, we’re going to be walking a tightrope. Dyson questions whether we will ever have self-driving cars roaming freely through city streets, while Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales who wrote his first program at age 13 and ran a tyro computing business by his late teens, explains from a technical perspective why this is. “No one knows how to write a piece of code to recognize a stop sign. We spent years trying to do that kind of thing in AI – and failed! It was rather stalled by our stupidity, because we weren’t smart enough to learn how to break the problem down. You discover when you program that you have to learn how to break the problem down into simple enough parts that each can correspond to a computer instruction [to the machine]. We just don’t know how to do that for a very complex problem like identifying a stop sign or translating a sentence from English to Russian – it’s beyond our capability. All we know is how to write a more general purpose algorithm that can learn how to do that given enough examples.” Hence the current emphasis on machine learning. We now know that Herzberg, the pedestrian killed by an automated Uber car in Arizona, died because the algorithms wavered in correctly categorizing her. Was this a result of poor programming, insufficient algorithmic training or a hubristic refusal to appreciate the limits of our technology? The real problem is that we may never know. “And we will eventually give up writing algorithms altogether,” Walsh continues, “because the machines will be able to do it far better than we ever could. Software engineering is in that sense perhaps a dying profession. It’s going to be taken over by machines that will be far better at doing it than we are.” Walsh believes this makes it more, not less, important that the public learn about programming, because the more alienated we become from it, the more it seems like magic beyond our ability to affect. When shown the definition of “algorithm” given earlier in this piece, he found it incomplete, commenting: “I would suggest the problem is that algorithm now means any large, complex decision making software system and the larger environment in which it is embedded, which makes them even more unpredictable.” A chilling thought indeed. Accordingly, he believes ethics to be the new frontier in tech, foreseeing “a golden age for philosophy” – a view with which Eugene Spafford of Purdue University, a cybersecurity expert, concurs. “Where there are choices to be made, that’s where ethics comes in. And we tend to want to have an agency that we can interrogate or blame, which is very difficult to do with an algorithm. This is one of the criticisms of these systems so far, in that it’s not possible to go back and analyze exactly why some decisions are made, because the internal number of choices is so large that how we got to that point may not be something we can ever recreateto prove culpability beyond doubt.” The counter-argument is that, once a program has slipped up, the entire population of programs can be rewritten or updated so it doesn’t happen again – unlike humans, whose propensity to repeat mistakes will doubtless fascinate intelligent machines of the future. Nonetheless, while automation should be safer in the long run, our existing system of tort law, which requires proof of intention or negligence, will need to be rethought. A dog is not held legally responsible for biting you; its owner might be, but only if the dog’s action is thought foreseeable. In an algorithmic environment, many unexpected outcomes may not have been foreseeable to humans – a feature with the potential to become a scoundrel’s charter, in which deliberate obfuscation becomes at once easier and more rewarding. Pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the cover of complexity for years (see the case of Thalidomide), but here the consequences could be both greater and harder to reverse. The military stakes Commerce, social media, finance and transport may come to look like small beer in future, however. If the military no longer drives innovation as it once did, it remains tech’s most consequential adopter. No surprise, then, that an outpouring of concern among scientists and tech workers has accompanied revelations that autonomous weapons are ghosting toward the battlefield in what amounts to an algorithmic arms race. A robotic sharpshooter currently polices the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, and while its manufacturer, Samsung, denies it to be capable of autonomy, this claim is widely disbelieved. Russia, China and the US all claim to be at various stages of developing swarms of coordinated, weaponized drones , while the latter plans missiles able to hover over a battlefield for days, observing, before selecting their own targets. A group of Google employees resigned over and thousands more questioned the tech monolith’s provision of machine learning software to the Pentagon’s Project Maven “algorithmic warfare” program – concerns to which management eventually responded, agreeing not to renew the Maven contract and to publish a code of ethics for the use of its algorithms. At time of writing, competitors including Amazon and Microsoft have resisted following suit. In common with other tech firms, Google had claimed moral virtue for its Maven software: that it would help choose targets more efficiently and thereby save lives. The question is how tech managers can presume to know what their algorithms will do or be directed to do in situ – especially given the certainty that all sides will develop adaptive algorithmic counter-systems designed to confuse enemy weapons. As in the stock market, unpredictability is likely to be seen as an asset rather than handicap, giving weapons a better chance of resisting attempts to subvert them. In this and other ways we risk in effect turning our machines inside out, wrapping our everyday corporeal world in spaghetti code. Lucy Suchman of Lancaster University in the UK co-authored an open letter from technology researchers to Google, asking them to reflect on the rush to militarize their work. Tech firms’ motivations are easy to fathom, she says: military contracts have always been lucrative. For the Pentagon’s part, a vast network of sensors and surveillance systems has run ahead of any ability to use the screeds of data so acquired. “They are overwhelmed by data, because they have new means to collect and store it, but they can’t process it. So it’s basically useless – unless something magical happens. And I think their recruitment of big data companies is a form of magical thinking in the sense of: ‘Here is some magic technology that will make sense of all this.’” Suchman also offers statistics that shed chilling light on Maven. According to analysis carried out on drone attacks in Pakistan from 2003-13, fewer than 2% of people killed in this way are confirmable as “high value” targets presenting a clear threat to the United States. In the region of 20% are held to be non-combatants, leaving more than 75% unknown. Even if these figures were out by a factor of two – or three, or four – they would give any reasonable person pause. “So here we have this very crude technology of identification and what Project Maven proposes to do is automate that. At which point it becomes even less accountable and open to questioning. It’s a really bad idea.” Suchman’s colleague Lilly Irani, at the University of California, San Diego, reminds us that information travels around an algorithmic system at the speed of light, free of human oversight. Technical discussions are often used as a smokescreen to avoid responsibility, she suggests. “When we talk about algorithms, sometimes what we’re talking about is bureaucracy. The choices algorithm designers and policy experts make are presented as objective, where in the past someone would have had to take responsibility for them. Tech companies say they’re only improving accuracy with Maven – ie the right people will be killed rather than the wrong ones – and in saying that, the political assumption that those people on the other side of the world are more killable, and that the US military gets to define what suspicion looks like, go unchallenged. So technology questions are being used to close off some things that are actually political questions. The choice to use algorithms to automate certain kinds of decisions is political too.” The legal conventions of modern warfare, imperfect as they might be, assume human accountability for decisions taken. At the very least, algorithmic warfare muddies the water in ways we may grow to regret. A group of government experts is debating the issue at the UN convention on certain conventional weapons (CCW) meeting in Geneva this week. Searching for a solution Solutions exist or can be found for most of the problems described here, but not without incentivizing big tech to place the health of society on a par with their bottom lines. More serious in the long term is growing conjecture that current programming methods are no longer fit for purpose given the size, complexity and interdependency of the algorithmic systems we increasingly rely on. One solution, employed by the Federal Aviation Authority in relation to commercial aviation, is to log and assess the content of all programs and subsequent updates to such a level of detail that algorithmic interactions are well understood in advance – but this is impractical on a large scale. Portions of the aerospace industry employ a relatively new approach called model-based programming, in which machines do most of the coding work and are able to test as they go. Model-based programming may not be the panacea some hope for, however. Not only does it push humans yet further from the process, but Johnson, the physicist, conducted a study for the Department of Defense that found “extreme behaviors that couldn’t be deduced from the code itself” even in large, complex systems built using this technique. Much energy is being directed at finding ways to trace unexpected algorithmic behavior back to the specific lines of code that caused it. No one knows if a solution (or solutions) will be found, but none are likely to work where aggressive algos are designed to clash and/or adapt. As we wait for a technological answer to the problem of soaring algorithmic entanglement, there are precautions we can take. Paul Wilmott, a British expert in quantitative analysis and vocal critic of high frequency trading on the stock market, wryly suggests “learning to shoot, make jam and knit”. More practically, Spafford, the software security expert, advises making tech companies responsible for the actions of their products, whether specific lines of rogue code – or proof of negligence in relation to them – can be identified or not. He notes that the venerable Association for Computing Machinery has updated its code of ethics along the lines of medicine’s Hippocratic oath, to instruct computing professionals to do no harm and consider the wider impacts of their work. Johnson, for his part, considers our algorithmic discomfort to be at least partly conceptual; growing pains in a new realm of human experience. He laughs in noting that when he and I last spoke about this stuff a few short years ago, my questions were niche concerns, restricted to a few people who pored over the stock market in unseemly detail. “And now, here we are – it’s even affecting elections. I mean, what the heck is going on? I think the deep scientific thing is that software engineers are trained to write programs to do things that optimize – and with good reason, because you’re often optimizing in relation to things like the weight distribution in a plane, or a most fuel-efficient speed: in the usual, anticipated circumstances optimizing makes sense. But in unusual circumstances it doesn’t, and we need to ask: ‘What’s the worst thing that could happen in this algorithm once it starts interacting with others?’ The problem is we don’t even have a word for this concept, much less a science to study it.” He pauses for moment, trying to wrap his brain around the problem. “The thing is, optimizing is all about either maximizing or minimizing something, which in computer terms are the same. So what is the opposite of an optimization, ie the least optimal case, and how do we identify and measure it? The question we need to ask, which we never do, is: ‘What’s the most extreme possible behavior in a system I thought I was optimizing?’” Another brief silence ends with a hint of surprise in his voice. “Basically, we need a new science,” he says.

          "headline": "Trump accuses Google of promoting Obama's speeches over his",
          "bodyText": "Donald Trump continued his attack on Google on Wednesday, accusing the internet giant of political bias and – specifically – of promoting Barack Obama’s speeches while ignoring his. Trump posted on his Twitter account a short video graphic criticizing Google alongside the hashtag #StopTheBias, which is being used on social media by other conservative figures The latest tweet followed a rash of posts earlier in the week in which Trump complained that Google’s news service is “rigged” against him. Trump pledged to address this “very serious” situation. On Wednesday afternoon, a tweet from the president’s @realDonaldTrump account declared: “For years, Google promoted President Obama’s State of the Union on its homepage. When President Trump took office, Google stopped.” A short video then shows dates of Obama’s State of the Union addresses, with a circle drawn on what is presumed to be a screenshot of a Google homepage that has the words: “Live! Watch President Obama’s State of the Union address. Tonight on YouTube at 9pm ET” beneath the Google logo. After cycling through several examples of the mention of Obama’s speech, the video shows the dates of Trump’s two addresses with a purported screen shot of a Google homepage with no mention of the event. The US president has already said the way Google displays news stories is biased in favour of stories from leftwing news outlets and suggested tech companies were trying to hide positive stories about his administration – something Google strongly denied. He went on: Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said Google had “really taken a lot of advantage of a lot of people, it’s a very serious thing”. Adding the names of Facebook and Twitter, he said: “They better be careful, because you can’t do that to people … we have literally thousands of complaints coming in.” But asked whether Trump thinks Google should be subject to some regulation, Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, told reporters outside the White House: “We’re taking a look.” Trump also said 96% of Google News results for “Trump” were from leftwing outlets, which he described as “very dangerous”. It is likely the US president was referring to a viral news story posted on Saturday by the website PJ Media, which concluded that the vast majority of Google News results for the president were from left-leaning outlets. The site used a classification that ranks almost every mainstream news outlet – other than Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist, and DailyMail.com – as leftwing. PJ Media said its survey of the top 100 Google News results for the search term “Trump” was “not scientific” but suggested “a pattern of bias against right-leaning content”. The US president possibly came across PJ Media’s 96% statistic after it was covered by the Fox News host Lou Dobbs on his Monday night broadcast. Google never reveals how its algorithm works, partly to stop news organisations from gaming the system in order to boost their ranking. Google News results can be a substantial driver of traffic for websites, with the system relying on a vast number of signals when it comes to ranking news stories, potentially including a news site’s long-term reputation and popularity. In a statement, Google insisted that it is not distorting results: “When users type queries into the Google search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology. “Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users’ queries. We continually work to improve Google search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.” The US president’s tweets – sent at 5.24am Washington DC time – are the latest in a string of attacks by Trump on major tech companies, as part of his ongoing criticism of the media. Earlier this month, he said that “too many voices are being destroyed” by social networks, who have become increasingly willing to ban prominent individuals who have broken their rules, such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Facebook, Twitter and Google chiefs are due to testify in Congress next week and can expect to come under attack from lawmakers, including with accusations of anti-conservtive bias."

          "headline": "How Flat Tummy Co gamed Instagram to sell women the unattainable ideal",
          "bodyText": "“Got Cravings?” asked the billboard from its perch above a Times Square pizzeria. “Girl, Tell Them To #SUCKIT”. The image was arresting: a pretty young woman sucking an “appetite suppressant” lollipop splashed across a canvas of millennial pink. Flat Tummy Co, an online retailer that had previously existed almost exclusively within the digital confines of Instagram, arrived in New York City like Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita updated into a 21st-century boss babe. The product for sale – 35 calories worth of flavored cane sugar laced with an extract of saffron that supposedly curbs hunger – sparked immediate backlash for a company that had built its brand selling so-called “detox” teas. Good Place actor Jameela Jamil called out Kim Kardashian West for promoting the lollipops to her 116 million Instagram followers (“You terrible and toxic influence on young girls,” Jamil tweeted), and more than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the billboard’s removal. Flat Tummy Co’s response has been to keep calm and ’gram on. The company is the ultimate Instagram brand success story: a perfect example of how unregulated social media marketing practices can repackage questionable science in the feelgood trappings of a wellness brand and spin women’s insecurities into cash. And Instagram, which claims to want to be “one of the most kind and safe” places on the internet, has neither the power nor the will to police it. Indeed, Instagram is such a crucial factor in Flat Tummy Co’s value that when the company was sold for $10m in 2015, its “significant social media presence” was highlighted in a press release ahead of actual assets or sales figures. Armies of “influencers” – including Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie and Kris Jenner – promote its products to their followers. Most of the influencers are strictly Instagram-famous: semi-professional models with tens of thousands of female followers who almost always fail to disclose that their endorsements are bought and paid for. “It’s not a positive message for women, is it? It’s pretty bad,” said one former Flat Tummy Co employee, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, about the company’s move into selling appetite suppressants. “The ex-employees are all quite close … Everyone’s just kind of, ‘Ugh, we were a part of that.’” The former employee argued that the outrage toward the Kardashians was misdirected: “Why is no one calling out the company? This isn’t about them. It’s the company that’s the problem.” ‘We thought we’d struck gold’ Flat Tummy Tea debuted on Instagram on 14 June 2013. It took time for the company to develop its current Instaesthetic: the tea was originally sold in transparent plastic bags that showed off the product’s earthiness; the label was a purplish blue; the font had yet to lose its serifs. But the beginnings of a brand identity were apparent from the outset: aspirational images of beautiful women with tiny stomachs and big butts, before and after shots of customers’ bloated and deflated bellies, and a studied mix of pseudo-feminist millennial boss bitch attitude: mason jar smoothies, jokes about alcohol, girl power slogans, an assortment of healthy-ish dishes, junk food and pink workout gear, and the odd inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela. Laramie Taylor, a professor of communication at UC Davis who researches media and idealized bodies, described the body image the brand promotes – “a very flat and toned stomach but the bust and posterior of someone whose body mass index is considerably higher” – as absurdly unrealistic. “It comes down to this idea of setting expectations for women that are frequently contradictory and impossible to satisfy,” Taylor said. The company was a humble affair at first, according to an interview founders Bec and Tim Polmear gave to a Tasmanian business publication in 2017 (they declined to speak to the Guardian). The tea was reportedly formulated to treat Bec Polmear’s “digestion and bloating”, and they manufactured it in their home garage in Australia with ingredients purchased from a local herbalist. The company’s first coup was a social media post by a popular nutrition blogger from New Zealand. “We had 17 orders in an hour and thought we’d struck gold,” Ted Polmear explained. From there, the company started paying Instagram influencers and built an algorithm that could predict a model’s sales potential, Polmear said. By November 2015, the brand had racked up 500,000 Instagram followers and was sold to Canada’s Synergy CHC Corp for $10m in cash and stock. ‘You’re not worth that much money’ In interviews with the Guardian, two former Flat Tummy Co employees described the process by which the company flooded Instagram with thousands of paid-for posts. Each week, they were tasked with identifying and contacting between 150 and 200 new influencers, with the goal of getting 50 to 60 of them on board for a series of four promotional posts each. The ideal model was a woman with at least 100,000 followers. “They had a rating system, depending on how ‘on brand’ you were,” explained one of the former employees. “You don’t want someone who already has a six pack. You want a mum who is on her fit journey trying to lose weight after having kids.” African American and Latina models were prized because their posts “converted” well into sales, while models were downgraded if they were too “slutty” on the assumption that their followers would be mostly male. “If someone is a little bit bigger, they get a higher rating than if someone’s skinny,” one former employee said. “No one is going to a listen to a skinny white girl say that she bought this tea and it’s great.” Added the other former employee: “If they were sexier, showed a lot of skin, or showed too much boobs, it was like, ‘Don’t pay them, try to get free posts.’” Valentina Barron, a spokeswoman for Flat Tummy Co, told the Guardian by email: “The ambassadors we collaborate with are a mix of all different types of women, because that’s what our customers are. Women can experience bloating, digestive issues or anything else in between no matter what their size.” The former employees said they were pressured to keep the cost of influencer posts down. While the Kardashians reportedly earn six-figure fees for their Instagram ads, the influencers that the former employees worked with were “lucky to get $25 to $50”, one of the former employees said. “You basically had to cut them down and say, ‘You’re not worth that much money.’” Once an influencer agreed to the deal, the staffers would direct how their photos should look and write copy for the captions: “We never expected them to actually use the tea. It just had to look like it.” Barron disputed that point: “We specifically request and most certainly expect, that all of our ambassadors try and love our products. That’s why they’re our ambassadors!” Both employees said they were disappointed with the company’s current direction. “They always used to preach this whole, ‘We’re not a weight loss company. We just want to be healthy,’” one said. “Which has obviously changed with these lollipops.” ‘Snake oil, plain and simple’ Flat Tummy Co nevertheless still claims that it cares about “health” above all. “Our brand is all about helping women look and feel like the best versions of themselves and our mission statement is to empower women to lead a healthier lifestyle,” Barron said. But medical and nutritional experts harshly criticized the company’s products and claims. “Dietary supplements sold for detox or weight loss are snake oil, plain and simple,” said Dr S Bryn Austin, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in eating disorder risks. “The liver and kidneys already do the the so-called detox and adding junk products into the diet only makes their job harder. And weight loss claims for these products are either outright sham or a result of adulteration of the products with potentially dangerous stimulants, laxatives or diuretics.” Dr Rachel Scherr, a researcher at UC Davis’s department of nutrition, reviewed the ingredients included in Flat Tummy Co’s products at the Guardian’s request, and raised numerous concerns. All the products rely on ingredients that are classified as nutritional supplements, rather than drugs, which means that they are untested and unregulated. Flat Tummy Co’s tea contains senna, a laxative, which Scherr said could help with bloating but could also lead to dependence on laxatives. The company’s meal replacement shakes include “patented and clinically studied Super Citrimax” – an extract of garcinia cambogia, which has been hawked as a miracle weight loss drug by the likes of Dr Oz but which Scherr noted has been “conclusively determined” to have no link to weight loss or fat loss. As for the lollipops, they include Satiereal, which Flat Tummy calls a “clinically proven safe active ingredient”. Scherr pointed out that the study touted by Satiereal’s French manufacturer is from 2010, while a study published in 2018 found “no effects” on weight loss. Scherr also criticized the “tips” for your “health kick” published on the company’s website, which include “Cut back on veggies.” “Does this company really recommend eating fewer vegetables?” Scherr asked. “That is not good advice!” Barron defended Flat Tummy Co in her statement, writing: “We never have, and never will – promote unhealthy eating behaviours or anything of that nature. Every product we’ve created for this brand, and everything we do with this brand, is all about motivating women to make positive, healthy changes in their lives, and our products are designed to give them the boost in the right direction that they might be missing.” To Claire Mysko, the chief executive officer of the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), this is nothing but a rhetorical ploy. “There is a shift away from language that explicitly talks about weight loss and a shift toward wellness and lifestyle changes,” she said. “It’s the same old products marketed in new language.” ‘The most kind and safe platform’ Both Mysko and Taylor, the UC Davis professor, expressed special concern over the marketing of the products on social media, especially since influencer posts are rarely labeled as advertisements, despite Instagram’s creation of a “paid partnership” label. “We’re comparing our real self to someone else’s made-up, photoshopped, carefully composed, idealized self,” Taylor said. “And ultimately that is exactly what the people who want to sell us these products need. They need us to feel bad about ourselves so we buy their product.” Instagram is fully aware of the dangers of spreading unrealistic body expectations. The company has banned various “thinspiration” and pro-eating disorder hashtags, and worked with NEDA on initiatives like an eating disorder help page and eating disorder recovery hashtag. “Every day people come to Instagram to build communities of support, particularly around body image,” spokeswoman Stephanie Noon said in a statement. “We are committed to making Instagram one of the most kind and safe platforms, and we will continue to shed light on the people redefining body image and encouraging body positivity in our community.” Indeed, Instagram has a number of policies designed to combat advertiser efforts to “generate negative self-perception” in order to sell health, fitness or weight loss products. Ads for such products are prohibited from targeting minors and from using “before and after” images or images that feature on “zoomed body parts”. And yet Flat Tummy Co is almost entirely immune to Instagram’s strictures because those policies only apply when an advertiser pays Instagram to promote their posts, not when the advertiser pays an influencer. So Flat Tummy Co can run as many “before and after” shots of zoomed in bellies as it wants – and it runs a lot of them – as long as it doesn’t pay Instagram to boost the posts’ audience. And if Flat Tummy Co wants to target teenage girls, it need only find an influencer with a young fanbase. Asked about this giant loophole, Noon responded, “We are looking at this area closely and trying to understand areas for improvement, so we can help our community navigate this type of content.” In the meantime, the combination of Instagram and Flat Tummy Co remains an astonishingly unhealthy brew. “Personally I will never buy something that has been recommended to me on Instagram,” said one of the former Flat Tummy Co employees. “I just know that there’s someone pulling the strings.”"

          "headline": "Trump's Twitter tantrum: Google may be controlling, but it's not partisan",
          "bodyText": "Early on Tuesday morning, Donald Trump lobbed the latest stink bomb in a conservative campaign accusing Silicon Valley’s tech giants of anti-Republican bias. In a series of tweets, the president said that Google search results were “RIGGED” against himself and other Republicans, asserting that 96% of the results for “Trump News” came from “National Left-Wing Media”. “Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good,” he wrote. “They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see.” It’s an opportune time for Trump and others such as Senator Ted Cruz to target companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. Non-stop controversy, from fake news to Cambridge Analytica, has made them convenient political punching bags. And these internet giants do have much to answer for, whether it’s their occasionally incorrect censorship decisions or their promotion of conspiracy theories. Trump is not wrong when he says that Google is “controlling what we can &amp; cannot see”. But he is wrong that the biases in Google’s search algorithms are partisan – or designed to harm his and other Republicans’ reputations. And the insistence on seeing algorithmic bias as stemming from partisan politics obscures the true nature of the various biases that shape our digital realities. A search engine is fundamentally a giant bias machine that we use to sort and rank the unfiltered web. If Google returned an alphabetical list of every web page that includes a certain search term, no one would use it. Instead, we ask Google to make judgment calls about whether any particular webpage contains information that is pertinent to our needs. To figure this out, Google uses a massive number of signals to return a ranked list of pages that it calculates to be most useful to the searcher. Although Google is not as transparent as many of us would like about how it makes these ranking decisions, it has published its guidelines, which show, for example, that it considers news sources to have high levels of “expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness” if their articles “contain factually accurate content presented in a way that helps users achieve a better understanding of events” and “have published established editorial policies and robust review processes”. These are not partisan attributes. Right-leaning news outlets are just as capable (and in most cases willing) to abide by standard journalistic practices as left-leaning outlets are. The existence of a partisan correlation does not imply partisan causation. Or, put more simply, if a company that openly admits to downranking non-factual news outlets ends up downranking a number of non-factual outlets that often happen to be rightwing, the likely reason is that those outlets are non-factual, not that they are conservative. This bias toward viewing the actions of tech companies as primarily partisan was also on display in the “shadow banning” debacle, another Trump firestorm that ensued after Vice News reported that Twitter was hiding the tweets and accounts of “prominent Republicans”. The Vice article accurately observed that a handful of Twitter accounts belonging to Republican party officials were being algorithmically downranked, but it ascribed that downranking to one characteristic of the accounts (the users were Republicans) without any evidence. The much more likely explanation for the downranking was a previously announced algorithm change by which Twitter judges whether an account contributes to so-called conversational “health” based on how other users respond to a user’s tweets. The desire to view a given phenomenon within the red/blue binary ended up blinding the reporter – and Trump – to what was really happening. “It does muddy the waters because one of the concerns people like I have is that these platforms do prioritize certain voices,” said Safiya U Noble, a University of Southern California professor whose recent book, Algorithms of Oppression, documents how search engines like Google can reinforce structural inequalities and replicate societal biases, such as racism and sexism. “The public relates to what’s happening on Google as if it’s a public information news portal, rather than an advertising platform that can optimize content based on the highest bidder,” Noble said. Noble argues that the much more important bias on internet platforms is toward money and power; those with both can pull any number of levers to affect what is being returned as a top result on Google and what is being written about by the mainstream news media. She also pointed out the absurdity of the president complaining about feeling powerless before a tech giant: “That’s not the same as people who don’t actually have political power.” As an example: at the crack of dawn this morning, a certain billionaire was moved to send an intemperate and largely inaccurate tweet. Thanks to his decision, I am now writing this article. That’s power."

          "bodyText": "Celebrating its 20th year, the festival run by the famed Liverpool club night returns to capture the breadth of commercial-leaning dance music, from 90s trance stars to modern EDM giants. Ex-professional football player Hannah Wants delivers pumping house on a Friday afternoon, and by the time of Green Velvet’s house and techno-stuffed set, the whole festival is bouncing harder than most manage at 4am. There’s no gradual build up to ease you in, just an on switch and an off switch; beats from breakfast until bedtime. This all-or-nothing approach seems to shed inhibitions, and creates a fiery feeling of hedonism from the audience who throw themselves into the party with infectious aplomb. The Chainsmokers’ headline set is as subtle as an unsolicited nude pic. They sound like a malfunctioning algorithm, all genres colliding together in an attempt to be all things at once. Thankfully, due to the huge number of stages spanning drum’n’bass to house, it means there are other options than listening to something that sounds like the soundtrack to a frat boy party where you’d be afraid to drink the communal punch. Such as Carl Cox, who plays a pristinely executed and ever-building set of techno that demonstrates why he’s had such longevity as a DJ. Annie Mac’s pop-heavy Saturday set makes perfect use of the rare blast of sunshine, while the Black Madonna also knows how to slip in a stonking piece of pop music – Pump Up the Jam – into her supremely crafted set. 4/4 beats are very much the festival’s time signature but there are shifts in rhythm with Giggs’s bass-booming rap set and a triumphant, twerk-heavy performance from UK rapper Stefflon Don. Eric Prydz closes the festival, avoiding big hitters such as his own Call on Me in favour of a surging deep house set, moving the crowd with tempo shifts rather than crowdpleasers – like DJ Sammy’s ultra-cheesy cover of Heaven, which the nearby Tiesto can be heard playing. Prydz is further elevated by a spectacular light show: lasers trigger and erupt in bursts to create an immersive sensory overload that, when matched with a huge beat drop, results in euphoric pandemonium. Even after the music ends, ravers can be found dancing to the hardcore sounds blasting from the waltzers, desperately clinging on to the final beats of the party before normality beckons. But the off switch is finally hit."

          "headline": "Cannabis cleanse? Why big tech is giving pot businesses the boot",
          "bodyText": "Got a question about cannabis? If so, then YouTube has long been a place to go. The platform’s power was something Green Flower Media understood well. The California company, which produces cannabis content focused on health and wellness, had posted hundreds of videos with titles like “What is cannabis terroir?” and “How to use cannabis with intention”. The videos racked up millions of views, says the company’s CEO, Max Simon. But then, a few months ago, “YouTube decided to go on a cannabis cleanse.” Simon says their channel disappeared and that they have been “provided absolutely no recourse whatsoever”. (A spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube, said there is a way to appeal.) Simon interprets the ban as a sign of the pervasive stigma against the drug. It probably also reflects a powerful company doing the safe thing while the technology industry faces unprecedented scrutiny surrounding privacy, free speech and other issues. Neither Google nor Facebook, the two most important internet companies, accepts marijuana advertising and both have been known to erase cannabis-related accounts without warning. Both companies say they want to allow discussions around the drug but not facilitate commerce. While attitudes about cannabis have been changing, it remains illegal almost everywhere they reach. That approach has created problems for the marijuana companies trying to get their brand out. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, is the dominant platform in the cannabis world. It’s where aficionados go to discover the latest pipes, the dankest crops and endless memes of cartoon characters getting high. For those in the know, Instagram can also be a place to search for unsanctioned cannabis markets. Facebook and the cannabis industry have more or less reached a detente where companies can post but not advertise. But there are exceptions, and enforcement can be spotty or arbitrary. A Facebook spokesperson said the company has been cracking down on opiate sales, which has probably resulted in a “shadow ban” that can make cannabis-related pages harder to find through Facebook searches, including those from mainstream media sources and government agencies. At Facebook, the system for determining whether an ad is appropriate – which involves the judgment of both a human and the algorithm – is not exact, a spokesperson acknowledged. For a time I advertised my cannabis newsletter, WeedWeek, on Facebook, until it stopped accepting my money. After I appealed against the decision, someone explained: “The ad was disapproved correctly for facilitating or promoting illegal products, services or activities.” This isn’t exactly true, but as a private company they have broad leeway to determine who can advertise. Facebook and Google have also banned ads for tobacco and restrict ads for guns and other weapons. The consequences of a ban can be disastrous for a business. Kyle Porter, the president of CMW Media, a cannabis marketing and PR firm, thought he was safe promoting a client that supplied hydroponic equipment frequently used by cannabis growers. He was wrong. Facebook banned him from advertising anything, for life. “As a marketing professional you can imagine how devastating that can be,” he said. “There’s no further action that you may take here,” someone at Facebook wrote to Porter with Kafkaesque authority. “Please consider this decision final.” Porter added that Facebook is sophisticated and rigorous with its enforcement. It has forced him to scramble for alternatives. “We just started Yahoo ads. I know that sounds silly but they’ll take us,” Porter said. They have also begun using influencers to market their products for them through social media, which he describes as a new form of guerrilla marketing. The lack of receptiveness from Facebook and Google is a serious concern for pot companies, which are limited in their access to traditional advertising through print media, radio, television and billboards. In response to marijuana’s internet problem, Christian Valdez started a cannabis digital ad network called Traffic Roots, which facilitates cannabis ads on about 300 cannabis sites and about 3,000 “cannabis-friendly” sites, many of them related to music, wellness and investment. Valdez got the idea when he was working at a pornography-oriented ad network and realized not even porn sites would accept pot ads. For cannabis businesses, limited advertising options mirror the struggle to operate financially in a quasi-legal world. “A lot of people talk about banking being an issue, but to have money coming into the bank you need to be able to advertise effectively,” Valdez said. “Before you have a banking problem you have an advertising problem.”"

Here, he attempts to divine the causes, talking to a survivor of a Golden Gate Bridge jump and learning about an algorithm that predicts future suicides (up to two years ahead) with 80-90% accuracy. It is also stressed that “in the fight against suicide, the power of a single conversation should not be underestimated”. Sensitive, candid and essential. Ali Catterall The Lenny Henry Birthday Show 8pm, BBC One Next Wednesday, Sir Lenny Henry turns 60; here, Sir Trevor McDonald presents a lighthearted and celebratory look back at a TV career that started 43 years ago with an appearance on New Faces and shows no sign of stopping any time soon.

          "bodyText": "30th over: India 124-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 8) Stokes carries on bombing Kohli, who sees him off. And that’s stumps, with India in a ridiculously strong position thanks to Hardik Pandya, their fourth seamer, who took five wickets in a single spell. We’ve had 307 runs in the day, just like yesterday, but there have been 16 wickets instead of six. Thanks for your company and some terrific correspondence, and thanks too to Adam Collins for putting in a long and lively shift while all those English wickets were tumbling. Say what you like about England – they’re good copy. The last email comes in from Simon Horbury at The Oval. “I ought to add,” he says (27th over), “that when a certain S Curran came onto bowl here, there were chants of ‘We hate Stokes’ from the Surrey faithful. Slightly unfair as it meant that Sammy was able to play for his wonderful county instead!” Hang on, here’s one more. “I love Rashid with the spent passion of a thousand dying stars,” says Robert Wilson. “It’s not much of a compliment. He had me at temperamental and titchy leggie and he would have to be the worst ever to lose my heart. That said, he’s like a particularly brilliant eight-year-old. It’s all about the wrong ’un. “Fag-smoking reprobate and letch, Shane Warne was never eight years old (even when he was eight). The googly, the slider and the quantum plunger were all smoke and mirrors to contextualise the murderous straight one. Filling batsmen’s heads with preposterous trigonometry until they fell victim to the bleak ordinance of the arm-ball. Brilliant, really. I wish Adil would learn that particular piece of sociopathic excellence.” 29th over: India 124-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 8) Anderson finds a peach to beat Pujara’s bat. Root was tempted to review but Buttler, his No 2, shook his head in authoritative fashion. Here’s John Starbuck, picking up on my question from the 27th over. “‘Bumpers’ is usually reserved for vehicles, these days, though there is some old-fashioned innuendo usage too.” Ah yes, Grace Jones. “Most people now say ‘bouncers’ (even more sexual innuendo) but since details of the Stokes Case emerged this might be a bit sensitive. How about ‘short balls’ or, plainly, ‘bodyline’? Even more old-fashioned but definitely intimidating.” Yes, bodyline is a great word, but it’s a strategy, not a delivery. 28th over: India 124-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 8) Stokes’s umpteenth bouncer unsettles Kohli, who ends up flat-batting it to the left of short leg. The next ball, also a bouncer, then comes close to finding the edge as Kohli opts to hook, but Bairstow fumbles it anyway. “There is heated debate over the England team’s performance,” says Bill Hargreaves, “and with good reason. With regard to selection, I think it’s time we discussed the elephant in the room. We’ve heard a lot about Geoffrey Boycott’s grandmother: it’s time she were given the nod.” 27th over: India 122-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 6) Pujara has a waft at Anderson, but gets away with it as there’s more bounce than he expected. The last ten overs have gone for only 26, which is a crumb of comfort for England. “Ben may be fine with his recall,” says Andy Smith, “but it has taken the focus of the Test away from the pre-match preparation, and we are suffering for it. Stokesy may have convinced our raw and inexperienced Capt Root that he was ready for a return, but wiser heads should have stepped in. We had a very capable player in Sam Curran, who should have played while Stokesy cooled his heels.” Hard to argue with that. 27th over: India 121-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 5) In the glow of the evening sun, Stokes is betting that Pujara can be bounced out, as he was in the first innings, by Woakes. Standing deep in his crease, unlike his team-mates, Pujara does well to evade one of Stokes’s better bumpers. Does anyone say bumpers any more? An email from Simon Horbury. “I’ve been at The Oval watching pink-ball cricket,” he says, “so I’ve not really been following England, but having noticed the catching is dismal (again), can I suggest that whoever the fielding coach at Lancashire is, he should be drafted in pronto. Annoyingly good slips!” 26th over: India 119-2 (Pujara 32, Kohli 4) Hmmm. Straight after taking that wicket, Rashid is removed from the attack, to make way for Anderson. Yes, Anderson bowls well at Kohli – but so does Rashid. 25th over: India 117-2 (Pujara 31, Kohli 3) Woakes finally takes his sweater after a superb spell for no reward (8-1-19-0). On comes Stokes, who apparently gave the team talk as England came out. He goes for four singles as Kohli settles in. A broadside has landed, from David Keech. “This match has been lost – and unless, counter to forecast, it pours down for the last 3 days, lost it is – and here are the reasons: “Arrogance: assuming a team as good as India will automatically collapse in a heap every time the ball swings a miniscule. The decision to insert after winning the toss was complete arrogance. “Lack of realism: England don’t do well when batting second facing a decent score. England’s second-Test win was based on outrageous luck. Stokes doesn’t deserve a place above Curran right now. England don’t catch well. All should have screamed don’t bat 2nd and balance your attack. “Stupidity: defined as repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results. Playing positive worked once. All it does now is create mega-collapses such as losing 10 wickets in a session after being 46–0 at lunch.” 24th over: India 113-2 (Pujara 29, Kohli 1) A minor triumph for Rashid, who has 1-24 off five overs. Redemption for Rashid! He bowls a googly and deceives Dhawan, who is stranded down the track and neatly stumped by Bairstow. However exasperating he can be, Rashid continues to get good batsmen out. 23rd over: India 109-1 (Dhawan 42, Pujara 28) Woakes gives away a four, for once, as Dhawan plays a leg-glance and Rashid, to Woakes’s irritation, opts not to dive at fine leg. 22nd over: India 103-1 (Dhawan 38, Pujara 27) A better over from Rashid, varying his pace and keeping Pujara quiet. 21st over: India 102-1 (Dhawan 38, Pujara 26) Woakes continues his lonely masterclass with a maiden. “England are not going to win this game,” says David Lloyd. “Can they save it?” You wouldn’t bet on it. 20th over: India 101-1 (Dhawan 38, Pujara 26) A few more singles off Rashid, who has 0-18 off three overs, and India have a hundred on the board already. Root doesn’t appear to be talking to Rashid much, when he seems the sort of bowler who needs a confidence boost. 19th over: India 97-1 (Dhawan 35, Pujara 25) A reprieve for Dhawan, and an injustice for Woakes, who’s been much the best bowler this evening. “Collingwood,” says Ian Copestake, “still plays cricket.” Scrambled seam, classic nick, bad miss – low to Cook’s right at first slip, but a lot easier than the one he caught yesterday. 18th over: India 96-1 (Dhawan 34, Pujara 25) A few singles and a two off Rashid. “He needs control or he needs wickets,” reckons Kumar Sangakkara, “one or the other.” “Brian W. [13th over] is far too kind,” says Ian Copestake, “but alas I have failed at the first hurdle of opttimism which is to live in a world far removed from reality where hopes are confused dreams flounderng in the wind. Still a bit surprised by our ball throwers though.” 17th over: India 91-1 (Dhawan 32, Pujara 22) Woakes, bowling to Pujara, strings together five more dots. With figures of 5-0-13-0, he’s the only bowler in this innings going for fewer than five an over. The lead is 260. “Re. Messrs Copestake and Withington [13th over],” says Damian Clarke. “Going have to watch Unbreakable at stumps.” 16th over: India 90-1 (Dhawan 31, Pujara 22) Rashid has a near one-day field, with just a slip in close, but there’s no one to stop Pujara’s elegant late cut. Pujara tries an instant replay and plays under the ball as Rashid finds some nice bounce. Then there’s a long hop, which is pulled straight for four. So two bad balls from Rashid, both punished; but one moral victory too. The sun is out, and Adil Rashid is coming on. He’s the only spinner to take a wicket in this match – that of Virat Kohli. An email from Lingam Manasvi. “I have only three (dreaded?) words to say regarding the selection: Bring back KP!” 15th over: India 81-1 (Dhawan 30, Pujara 14) Dhawan clips Woakes for four and that’s drinks, with India so firmly in charge, they could be Brighton playing Man United. And our latest selector is Kim Thonger. “As Root appears to be mentally exhausted and is transmitting his tiredness to the ‘batting unit’, why not drop him for the final two tests and bring Sam Curran in as captain?” 14th over: India 76-1 (Dhawan 25, Pujara 14) Pujara straight-drives Stokes for four, then on-drives him for four more: two handsome strokes. The selection debate continues. “Obviously time to recall Hales to open the batting in place of Jennings,” Nigel Williamson reckons. “He has all the iconoclastic attributes that Ed Smith seems to like. He doesn’t play red ball cricket any more and loves hanging around dodgy nightclubs at 2.30am. Cometh the hour, cometh the unsuitable man...” 13th over: India 67-1 (Dhawan 24, Pujara 6) Woakes, using the crease, keeps Pujara quiet, and beats him with the last ball, angled in and jagging away. Brian Withington has a question for you. “Is the ever optimistic Ian Copestake (4th over) the yang to my yin (Eng 37th over)? I could only aspire to such potential interconnectedness with the spiritual master of the OBO.” 12th over: India 66-1 (Dhawan 23, Pujara 6) Well bowled Stokes, but also well played Rahul, who got this innings off to a breezy start. Stokes blots his copybook a bit by greeting Pujara with a puffball bouncer and then a freebie on leg stump, duly flicked for four. A thickish edge brings two more, and the lead is a towering 234. Stokes makes the breakthrough! It was full, it was heading in, it hit the pad and then the stumps. And that’s Stokes’s first wicket on his hotly debated comeback. 11th over: India 59-0 (Dhawan 22, Rahul 36) Woakes has another stifled appeal, against Rahul, but his nip-backer was nipping back too far. And another, less stifled, but again doing too much. There’s enough movement to keep England interested, but not enough to get India bothered. A salty tweet from Nuggehalli Nigam. “Dhawan’s strategy of relying solely on fortune rather than skill might backfire at some point.” 10th over: India 56-0 (Dhawan 20, Rahul 36) A double change as Stokes comes on. First ball, he sends a man flying to the floor. But it’s an innocent collision with Dhawan, who was responding to a bit of tip-and-run from Rahul, and they’re all smiles. Last ball, Rahul edges an inswinger and Bairstow misses a tough chance to his left. To add insult to insult, it goes for four. Rahul, riding his luck but playing shrewdly too, has 36 off only 29 balls. 9th over: India 50-0 (Dhawan 19, Rahul 31) Right on cue, here is Woakes. Dhawan cuts for four, with Pope perhaps getting a fingertip to it as he makes a salmon leap at cover. There’s an lbw appeal, but it’s on the high side and maybe pitching outside leg. That’s two opening partnerships of fifty for India in the match, the first time they’ve managed it in a Test in England since 1986. “The subtle art of captaincy,” says Geoff Wignall. “So no runs to play with and no third man, where England have leaked runs throughout the series? The reasoning is far too subtle for me to spot. “On the question of how to incorporate Bell, surely at 3 with Bairstow &amp; Cook opening, Root at 4, Pope 5, Buttler 6 &amp; keeping, Woakes 7, Curran 8, Jennings and Stokes elsewhere.” 8th over: India 46-0 (Dhawan 15, Rahul 31) Dhawan slices Broad for four over the slips, which leads Root, finally, to post a third man. It’s Stokes, about ten yards in, so maybe he’s a very fly slip. And then Rahul crashes another four past cover. Part of England’s problem here is that their two old stagers didn’t get a decent rest, as their innings only lasted 38.2 overs. Time for Woakes, surely. 7th over: India 37-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 27) Anderson is bowling a very full length, rightly, but it allows Rahul to play a block for four, through mid-off. And when Anderson adjusts by going back to a good length, Rahul seizes on it and plays a dreamy back-foot glide through the covers. India lead by 205. 6th over: India 29-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 19) An early single for Rahul allows Broad to have a good go at Dhawan, who very nearly gets a touch on a fast, lifting leg-break. Calm has been restored, but England need wickets – about four of them. 5th over: India 28-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 18) Anderson raps Dhawan on the pad with the in-ducker, but only the slips appeal as it’s too high. That’s a maiden, which England needed – you can hardly keep calm and carry on if you’re not calm in the first place. On Twitter, Andrew Samson from TMS has a good spot. “England did not lose 10 wickets in a session between 1938 and 2016. Today is the 3rd time they have done this in 2 years (24 Tests). Others: v Bangladesh at Mirpur 2016 and v NZ Auckland 2018.” 4th over: India 28-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 18) Beaten by a jaffa, Rahul then edges Broad low, to the boundary at third man, or third no-man as we may have to start calling it. Same again, more of a guide, for two this time; then a better shot, a controlled flash for four more. A day that began so well for England is running away from them at high speed. But hope springs eternal for Ian Copestake. “Surely perfect conditions for your Jimmy Andersons, Stuart Broads and Chris Woakeses to swing India out for 50 and get the win.” 3rd over: India 18-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 8) Rahul lofts Anderson over square leg for four, as if playing in a benefit match, then goes for a big mow and gets an inside edge in the same direction. “In their own conditions India baltied and curried England in their own backyard,” says Inderpal Sokhy. “Joy unbounded. C’mon jawans of India, do it.” They’d be hard put not to, from here. 2nd over: India 13-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 3) Rahul is away with a leg glance or two, and then Dhawan gets a leading edge that plops safely between cover and mid-off. It’s dead gloomy at Trent Bridge, and I’m not just talking about England’s predicament. 1st over: India 8-0 (Dhawan 8, Rahul 0) Second ball, Dhawan plays a delicious cover drive for four. Third ball, he’s rapped amidships as they say on TMS, but not too bothered by it. Last ball, he edges a full one off the back of the bat for four through fourth slip, which is vacant because England have no runs to play with. England are out there, and Anderson is on a hat-trick. Dhawan the man facing... and he plays a comfortable push into the on side for none. “Obviously at this juncture,” muses James Walsh, “one’s mind turns to the question of who should be dropped for an Ian Bell recall in the fourth Test. Pope could make way as punishment for having a cover drive not quite as beautiful as Bell’s, but that seems a touch retrograde after two Tests. “They could drop Stokes and play Bell at six, where he has a much better batting record. Also Bell’s medium-pace swingers would break up the sameyness of England’s pace attack. Or if Bell reports to the ECB that he hasn’t bowled in a decade and isn’t sure his record justifies his place as fourth seamer, they could bring back Curran and drop Butler, whose place in the team as a specialist number seven is a bit odd, and put Bell in ahead of Stokes. “My personal preferred option, however, is to put Jennings out of his misery and have Bell alongside his old ODI opening partner and close pal Alastair Cook. I look forward to seeing which Sledgehammer option Ed Smith et al go along with.” A heartfelt email from Deepak. “On the subject of names (start of day’s play), there’s a simple reason that R Ashwin prefers to be known as such: Ravichandran is his father’s name, while his actual given name is Ashwin. Like most South Indian Hindus (myself included), the family name is rarely used, with more importance given to the father’s name and then the given name. On an unrelated note, I live in the South Indian state of Kerala which, as you may know, has been severely affected by heavy rainfall and flooding. I am lucky to be in a place that has escaped the disaster almost completely, but many of my fellow Malayalis, including relatives and friends, are still in deep trouble. It is therefore my duty to ask a favour of the amazing OBO community: please help the victims in any way that you can. Here are a few links for people from the UK to contribute: https://sewauk.org/current-appeals/appeal-for-kerala-flood-relief/ https://fundly.com/kerala-flood-relief-fund-from-europe https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/how-to-donate-to-cm-relief-fund-for-kerala-flood-relief-and-rehabilitation-4991431.html “Every little bit counts. Thank you all.” Well, well, well. While Adam was on duty, I slipped out for lunch with some friends, who produced a spectacular home-made crumble. Which is just what England have done. Ten in a session is going some even by their standards, but well well well played India. In other news, Man United are two down at Brighton. Make that 2-1. That’s me done. What a session. But as we unpick the England collapse - all ten wickets falling for 107 - don’t forget the Indian quicks. From the moment they walked out after lunch they put on a clinic. Ishant and Bumrah, then Shami and Pandya - all brilliant. The latter, in the process, nabbed his maiden five-wicket bag in Test cricket. Speaking of five, that’s the number of catches taken by Pant, the wicketkeeper on debut. Over to Tim de Lisle. I’ll talk to you all on day four, provided the Test makes it that far. Bye! Buttler holes out to long-on. He did what he had to but there was always a risk with the field out. England, Andrew Samson relays on TMS, have been bowled out inside a session for the third time in two years. Two hours ago they were 54 without losing a wicket. Wow. 38th over: England 159-9 (Buttler 37, Anderson 1) BOOM! Buttler doing a real job here, driving the deficit to 171 with a classic T20 slap over extra cover having gotten his front leg out of the way. Six runs! He’s hitting them beautifully, a glorified net as he flays Ishant to various sweepers through the middle portion of the over. Now, once again, we are back to two balls left and again Kohli refuses to bring his field in. Odd for him to care so much about runs at this point when he could get six balls at Anderson. Anyway, we go through the process again: catchers in for the single delivery that Jimmy has to deal with... and he does! Nothing wrong with that forward defence. 37th over: England 152-9 (Buttler 30, Anderson 1) Pandya is replaced after his magnificent spell of 6-1-28-5, Bumrah now taking the ball from our end. Buttler is picking out the fielders but won’t be tempted unless there are two on offer. With two balls left in the over that equation changes slightly but the field remains out. Oi, Virat, that’s not how it works. With two balls to go, you play your part and bring them in, okay? Predicably, then, Jos grabs one down the ground, again leaving Jimmy one ball. It’s short and staight but the no. 11 plays it down with just enough poise. Well done. “At least my earlier concerns about avoiding the follow on proved quite unfounded,” writes Brian Withington, quite rightly. When England were going nicely before lunch he predicted something just like this. 36th over: England 151-9 (Buttler 29, Anderson 1) Ishant is back to try and find the last. He deserves to finish what he started. Buttler, though, has a lot of experince manipulating fields from white-ball cricket and does so with a carve out to deep point with enough of an angle to get back for two to bring up the England 150. How about that, ay? Back to Jos, he’s nearly done by the yorker that inevitably comes before taking the single to midwicket from the penultimate ball of the over. Anderson has one to see off with four slips and a short leg in position. He’s beaten. That’s too good for Jimmy. 35th over: England 148-9 (Buttler 26, Anderson 1) Clever from Anderson to nab a quick single with the cover fielder napping early in the Pandya over. Buttler’s turn, and he races back for a couple after clipping into the on-side. Will he opt for the single from the last delivery this time around? Yep, another quick one, to midwicket. Anderson is up to the task, racing to the danger end like a 100m sprinter. Tea is due in four minutes but it won’t be taken until the change of innings given they are nine down. A massive session given it was already extended to two and a half hours. We’ll see. 34th over: England 144-9 (Buttler 23, Anderson 0) The follow-on avoided by no more than three inches! Buttler’s leading edge is found by Shami and it juuuuuust makes it over the head of the man at cover. They come back for a couple as the crowd give an enthusiastic ironic cheer. With that out of the way, Jos lofts the next ball over the bowler’s head for four. Lovely strike. Next up he launches him high into the top deck of the grandstand to my left, a huuuuge six! Will he take the single from the last ball? Nup - he’s slogging, through midwicket, for four more! 16 runs from the over to put a dent in what is going to be a hefty deficit. The right call in the circumstances. “In perhaps the best bowling conditions he might get, Pandya has shown potential,” adds Anand Kumar. “I was, however, hoping for the classic Broad review.” Wait till he has the ball in his hands later this afternoon for a couple of L’Oreals. (He’s worth it) 33rd over: England 128-9 (Buttler 7, Anderson 0) Beaten! Jimmy survives but only because Pandya’s off-cutter has jagged a mile. Remember, England began this session 46-0 and at one stage were 54-0. Undone by some superb fast bowling. No hat-trick but he gets him three balls later! Full, straight, plum! Pandya has five! England, with Anderson walking out, are still a couple of runs short of the follow-on and he will have one ball to survive this over. Good grief. Pandya has four! And he’s on a hat-trick! It comes via another outswinger that finds the edge and the wicketkeeper Pant takes his fifth catch of the session. 32nd over: England 128-7 (Buttler 7, Rashid 5) Okay, Jos hits his cover drive for four. That’s good batting. Some hope still lives with him. Shami’s bouncer at Rashid later in the over doesn’t give the impression that he’ll be able to resist for long, though. Rapid. “When the Indian team toured England in 1967, we ten-year-olds collapsed with laughter at the idea that the world’s two shortest books were Great Scottish Goalkeepers and Great Indian Fastbowlers,” emails Graham Whittington from deepest Drance. “One of them, at least, is long out of print.” Too right. They’ve been superb. The Root dismissal that made bad much worse earlier in the session. Two in the over! Confirmed by the dreaded spike, Woakes did get something on it. It is Pant’s fourth catch of the session and the second that required an athletic dive down the legside. Wickets bookending the Pandya over with a couple of boundaries between times but that doesn’t matter now: England in enormous strife and still short of the follow-on mark. Wow. 31st over: England 118-7 (Buttler 2) Is Woakes caught too? He’s taken down the legside, hooking at a bouncer. He’s sent it upstairs for review having been given out on the field. Let’s see. Pandya has another! Conventional as you like, a ball that moved away in the air that Bairstow was committed to playing at given the off-stump line where it pitched. It is another straightforward catch for Rahul, who has claimed three in about 20 minutes at second slip. India are some chance of taking all ten England wickets in a session. 30th over: England 110-5 (Bairstow 15, Buttler 2) Buttler edges his first ball as well, albeit landing a foot metre in front of Kohli at third slip. In theory, 50 overs are still available to India today through to 7pm (including the extra half an hour). As usual, they won’t get those in. For shame. Anyway, Shami running away from the pavilion is a bit too straight to Buttler who is off the mark with a couple to square leg. The end of another successful over. These two senior players must be there at tea. A fifth for the session! No need to send that upstairs, Stokes’ nick going straight to the chest of Rahul at second slip. He had to play the delivery and it did just enough off the track to catch the edge. Yet more fine fast bowling from the visitors. 29th over: England 1o8-4 (Bairstow 15, Stokes 10) I can see Ravi Ashwin beneath us at mid-off. With the left-handed Stokes still not set, I reckon he’ll be back into the attack soon to have a pop. In saying that, he was off for a while so he might not be able to bowl until the final session. I’ll check on that. To the present time, Bairstow plays his best shot yet, nailing Pandya on the up through extra cover for a lavish boundary. He picked up another at the start of the over but from the outside portion of the blade. Good scrap. 28th over: England 1o0-4 (Bairstow 7, Stokes 10) Shami from pavilion end gets his off-cutter on target to YJB who gets his bat down just in time; an inside edge found. He’s more convincing later in the over, bringing up the England 100 with a glance to fine leg. And for the first time today, here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo) at Nottingham. “And Soft Signal strikes again,” notes Abhijato Sensarma. “He is giving Muralidharan’s record a run for its money. He gets the wickets almost half the time he is even mentioned! If not for this decision, it could have even been in line for a knighthood. Some people ask why he exists in the first place since his inclusion in the game seems illogical, and I am personally inclined to agree with these people, but it is hard to deny that his presence can be felt more often than the opposition likes!” Very good. Soft signal, Mother Cricket and the Cricket Gods all dine together at night. 27th over: England 99-4 (Bairstow 6, Stokes 10) NOT OUT! Very strong shout but the ball is only clipping the top of off-stump so Stokes survives. India keep their review with it registering with the technology as umpires’ call. Is Stokes LBW? Pandya believes so, the umpire doesn’t. DRS to decide. Stand by. 26th over: England 97-4 (Bairstow 5, Stokes 10) Shami asks early in the over whether Stokes is leg before but he isn’t. The England all-rounder makes contact with the next offering on his pads, clipping through the air to the midwicket rope for his second boundary. Tea still 55 minutes away. 25th over: England 92-4 (Bairstow 5, Stokes 6) Stokes away pushing a couple to mid-off first up. Later in the set Pandya does him with another beauty, beating him on the inside edge. But Stokes, given some width to finish, slaps a boundary over backward point to conclude the successful over. “Curious how that decision would have gone had the umpires gave it not out and referred?” ponders Anand Kumar. “My point, if they are rarely going to overturn, why not stay with onfield umpries (or) just ask them without prejudice?” The toothpaste is probably out of the tube on this. For now, let’s just be grateful that the third umpire here didn’t get sucked into believing (as they so often do) that there was too much doubt to give it out having watched the replay 30 times. It’s out! Root is gone! The crowd don’t like it but the end of Rahul’s fingers, as Graeme Swann says on TMS, are where the ball has bounced up from. First ball of Pandya’s spell; first after drinks. Root waves the bat around when OUT flashes up on the board, I suspect the match ref will be taking a second look at that later on. What a session. Is Root caught at second slip? He’s given but they are checking upstairs. 24th over: England 86-3 (Root 16, Bairstow 5) Shami is on to replace Ishant, who has been outstanding since lunch. The new bowler zips a short ball into the midrift of YJB but he’s happy enough out there at the moment, defending out the maiden. And with that, they drink. What a wonderful 75 minutes of Test cricket. 23rd over: England 86-3 (Root 16, Bairstow 5) Bumrah’s long spell continues. He’s only been out of operation for one over so far in this innings and that was as he changed ends before lunch. Root grabs one behind square to begin this set, then Bairstow pushes one to point before Root flicks a couple more. There is a no-ball in the mix as well. That’s the first over where England have looked in control since they lost Cook. “Try your pun-ditry with Pant pronounced as Punt,” emails Ravi Raman “It might be spelled with an A but it’s pronunciation doesn’t match Pant the clothing or Pant the breathing.” Maybe so but I fear you are going to be swimming uphill on this one, Ravi. The subeditors of the world (and twitter) will be having fun about pants for a decade. 22nd over: England 81-3 (Root 13, Bairstow 4) Ishant into YJB’s inside edge and nearly makes it to Jadeja (the sub on for Ashwin) at square leg. The number five keeps his cool, clipping the next offering to the midwicket rope. Half a shout for leg before to finish, in keeping with the theme of this relentless session so far. “Funny how after all the jaffas in this spell, a wicket falls to the tickle down the leg side,” says Amand Kumar. “Almost feels like everyone is wasting time bowling outside the off.” Remember, it’s a horrible game most of the time. Meanwhile, Brian Withington is feeling creative. ‘Instant Sharma’, this goes by: Instant Sharma’s gonna get you Gonna knock you right on the head You better get yourself together Pretty soon you’re gonna be dead (By strangulation) 21st over: England 77-3 (Root 13, Bairstow 0) Bumrah finds Root’s outside edge again - twice in two overs - but he’s played it with soft enough hands that it reaches Kohli only on the bounce at third slip. Then he does him with another of those vicious leg-cutters. What a superb contest! Can the England captain get through his spell? Pant is the third ‘keeper to claim the first three dismissals on debut, Andrew Samson tells us on TMS. Interestingly, Tim Paine was one of the other two (Lord’s 2010). 20th over: England 75-3 (Root 11, Bairstow 0) Bairstow the new man has to duck under a quick and accurate bumper first up. “It is very tricky batting out there,” notes Graeme Swann on TMS. Compelling from where I’m sitting, directly behind the arm at Bumrah’s end. Good batting from the new man in response to Ishant’s moving ball, getting his hands out of the way when he can, defending solidly when forced to play. “Those three dismissals,” lols Andrew Benton, “they’re just Pant’s.” Since his IPL ton a couple of years back, which I had the great enjoyment of commentating on radio, I’ve been trying to get going the idea of one putting their Rishabhs on, or whipping them off. My girlfriend doesn’t get it but I’m persisting. Now he’s in the Test XI, we can do this. And there it is! Pope has been burgled down the legside from the first ball of the fresh Ishant over. It’s not a good delivery nor a pretty dismissal. It is, however, a fine diving catch from the wicketkeeper Pant on debut. The visitors really are up and about. 19th over: England 75-2 (Root 11, Pope 10) Edge! Four! It bounced between the ‘keeper and slip and ran away to the rope, moving Root to double figures. He’s even luckier to survive a rip snorter later in the set, Bumrah sending down an unplayable legcutter that beats the captain’s outside edge. India are very close to a third here. 18th over: England 71-2 (Root 7, Pope 10) Root off the mark! It took 13 balls but he didn’t miss out when Ishant gave him a wayward delivery under his armpit, turned around the corner for four. ‘Rooooooot’ roar the attentive audience. Three more then come from the next ball, the captain timing past point from high on the balls of his feet the way he did so wonderfully during his 250 at Manchester a couple of summers ago. 17th over: England 64-2 (Root 0, Pope 10) Bumrah the proverbial coat of paint away from making it three England wickets in a hurry! It is magnificent fast bowling, cutting Pope in two with a ball that moves a mile and deserves to collect a stump or two. But not so. Back to back maidens with the pressure building on the England pair. “Christ, Adam! Hitler the cricketer?!” Hi Dave in Vienna. “I wish you wouldn’t do that! (OK, it wasn’t you) I got halfway through the line in that Ali Martin tweet (7th over) “Middlesex giving a CC debut to 19-year-old Ethan Bamber today, whose father, David, played Adolf Hitler” and was about to seriously question if Hitler ever played cricket, before I got to the “in a 2008 Tom Cruise film” bit. Best regards from a very hot Vienna, where Hitler definitely did NOT play cricket.” I’m still angry with you lot for overtaking Melbourne as the official (official?!) ‘World’s Most Liveable City’ during the week. 16th over: England 64-2 (Root 0, Pope 10) Ishant really building into this spell, once again finding Root’s inside edge. Then he beats it, crashing into his front pad! Big shout! Denied. They take every one of the 15 seconds at their disposal to decide on DRS, declining to refer in the end. That’s a good decision with the ball hooping beyond the leg stump. This is a very impressive spell from the mainstay of this Indian attack. Another of those, Ashwin, is off the field at moment with a hip complaint. “Bom dia Adam!” G’day, Adam Hirst. “There is proper cricket in Brazil as well. The Carioca Cricket Club in Rio for one! We’ve got a tour to the Cricket Brazil headquarters in September too, to play the local teams of mostly young Brazilians from the development project.” This is great! Please continue... “Any clubs that would like to arrange a cricket tour to Brazil, just get in touch with me! We’ve got Rio (a beach match and our proper cricket ground in the Corridor of Sun Certainty), the Cricket Brazil HQ, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires and the beautiful ground at Santiago as possibilities. We’ve also got our nets on the baseball diamond on the shores of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, with the statue of Cristo up above, a beautiful spot to practice. The MCC toured here earlier this year, so you’d be following in distinguished footsteps. Perhaps the OBOers would fancy it?” If somebody else wants to do the admin, and provided it doesn’t clash with any major international series, then I’ll be up for that. Do we have a skipper/administrator? 15th over: England 64-2 (Root 0, Pope 10) Pope once again goes at the first delivery of the over, pull/hooking Bumrah’s to the vacant square leg for a couple, moving into double figures in seven balls. It was a top edge, mind. He defends and leaves the rest. “Instant should have open the bowling,” argues Dilip Shukla. Fair enough but Bumrah has done very little wrong and Shami does his best work when the ball is moving. A good problem to have in these helpful conditions. 14th over: England 62-2 (Root 0, Pope 8) Driving again from the first ball of Ishant’s new over, Pope strikes nicely down the ground for three. Root’s turn, facing his first delivery and it nearly slips through! Another inside edge. The lights are on at Trent Bridge are so are India’s quicks all of a sudden. Root defends the rest, playing himself in. “On the subject of England’s cable Knits, how did Cook and Pope get one indeed?” asks John Barnes. “I’ve been trying to buy one for a few years now with no luck of sourcing them. I’ve come to the conclusion there is a very good company/grandmother supplying England and not marketing their lovely jumpers. Alas!” I’m not sure what the rules are on plugging companies on the OBO but I’ll email you a link to the joint that have done a great job for both of my clubs in Australia and the UK. 13th over: England 59-2 (Root 0, Pope 5) Shot! Ollie Pope is off the mark with a compact cover drive through extra cover, racing away to the rope with fine timing. Four slips are in place but it is the inside edge that Bumrah locates with the final ball of his successful over, missing his leg stump by a matter of inches. All happening! Two in two balls for India! That’s poor from Jennings, hanging the bat at a ball that he did not need to have anything to do with. “He has a real issue when you bowl over the wicket when it moves across him,” notes Michael Vaughan. “It is a technical issue.” That may very well be Jennings’ penultimate innings as an international opener. Outstanding bowling from Ishant, drawing Cook into the stroke from around the wicket. The delivery has plenty of movement in the air and off the track, at decent pace. He had to play. The edge is taken by Pant, his first dismissal as a Test cricketer. He’s a lucky lad, as there was a dropped catch at slip earlier in the over that was his fault. A shocker, where Cook’s nick was heading straight to Pujara but Pant tried to leap in front of him and put him off in the process. Anyway, no damage done. 12th over: England 54-1 (Jennings 20) 11th over: England 50-0 (Cook 25, Jennings 20) Moments after hitting send on the previous over, Michael Vaughan picked up on the cable-knit colour thread on TMS! Here I was, thinking I was the only weirdo who would pick up on such a thing. Nup, the former England numero uno is with me. He suggests maybe it was a jumper he made a ton in? We’ll get to the bottom of this by stumps tonight, I am certain. Bumrah is still operating at the same end he finished off at before lunch. It’s a solid re-start, banging in short of a length at Jennings who is happy to play conservatively throughout. Answers! Vaughan has received a text on air from the boss of New Balance. The cream sweater is new for this season, changed on the direction of the players as they didn’t much fancy the all-white number from the summer of 2017. That was easy. Why, then, are so many still wearing the white shocker in the field? Get with the program, fellas. 10th over: England 50-0 (Cook 25, Jennings 20) Ishant to Cook, who now has his sleeveless on. Now, this is a topic of interest to me. I noticed in the field yesterday that only the former captain and the new lad Ollie Pope have the cream coloured cable knit, by contrast to every one of their colleagues who are getting around in those (shocking) whiter-than-white jumpers. Can’t be having this, can we? Or is this like the old days where there might half a dozen different coloured batting helmet inside an England dressing room, as it was during the 1994-95 Ashes in Australia? Has Cook refused to go with the updated model? How, then, did Pope get one of those? Good questions to ask. He has a good answer to an Ishant full delivery, square driving a boundary to bring up the England 50! Going very nicely. 150 minutes of the best. This is all ahead of us, an extended session due to the rain that delayed the start of play this morning. Ishant Sharma has the ball in his hand at the Pavilion End for the first time today to get us going. Cook the man on strike. PLAY! Pot Pouri. Let’s work through some correspondence. To begin, Brian Withington. “A feature of this series TV coverage has been ongoing criticism of the positioning of the slip cordon of both teams. Sir Ian Boredom has of course opined regularly on the subject, but respected Sky observers such as messrs. Hussain, Holding and Sangakkara have also piled in. Surely in this era of extensive analysis someone has come up with a well researched algorithm for optimising spacing that favours the tighter stagger?” Whatever happened to extending arms and touching fingers to determine how far away the slips stand from each other? Simpler times. “Talking of countries (Spain) which have missed the boat cricket-wise you might be interested to know about the version of cricket we have in Brazil,” emails Tom Ashton. “Very popular in country towns amoung children but imagine if Brazil has stayed the course. Would have been nice to watch a test match in Rio.” I’d be the first to sign up to cover that. As it happens, I complete the set (with the exception of Pakistan and Afghanistan) in October when Australia plays in the UAE. Robert Wilson is with us from Paris on the topic of Spanish cricket. “The question is, of course, not how popular it is there but how good would they be if they played it,” he begins. “It’s cricket’s permanent heartbreak, that thought. I often think about here in France (current Olympic Silver Medal holders in cricket). Best untutored kid I ever saw was a sporty French 12 year who, despite my approximate French and some dire Irish weather, picked up a formally perfect side-on, high-arm quick’s action in about ten minutes. Ha had that natural sportsman’s instinctive sympathy for the unchanging physics of all that is bat and ball. Went on to play hockey for the French under 16s. Tragedy is, he was clearly better at cricket.” Usain Bolt, you may have seen, is trying to start his professional football career in New South Wales. For mine, I wish he tried to play cricket for the state instead. That’ll get the punters back to the Sheffield Shield. “Never mind the Spanish,” says John Barns. “I’ll never forget my very sporty Head Teacher Mr Reese back in Gloucestershire in 1986 informing us that in “50 years China will beat England in a test match” a shocking thought. I think the central theme of his assembly was globalisation but suffice to say I’ve not seen a sniff of a Chinese cricket team to even play such a fixture yet alone one to threaten the odds. Pah, 18 years to go Mr Reese, you were chuntering out of your proverbial; that’ll show you for all my detentions.” My colleague, Tim Wigmore, has a number of thoughts on cricket in China. I’ll ask him to link me a piece on the topic. In short, my understanding is that Mr Reese might not be completely off the mark with some decent progress made there in the last decade or so. “A collective statsgasmic research task,” emails Tom Bowtell. Sounds like perfect OBO content to me. “Jimmy Anderson has taken his last 200 Test wickets at 20.30. I’m wondering where that puts him in terms of the cheapest run of 200+ wickets within a career. To get us started, between 19th June 1984 and 26th April 1989, Malcolm Marshall took 212 at 18.07 (https://bit.ly/2Mm3PAP) So Jimmy isn’t number 1 - but maybe number 1 for England?” We’re about five minutes from the resumption, can anyone work it out before then? In case you missed it. India resumed at 307-6 having lost a wicket with the final delivery of day one. 30 minutes were lost to rain before they got on but when they did, England carried on where they left off with the second new ball, Pant and Ashwin bowled by Broad before Anderson cleaned up Shami and Bumrah in consecutive balls. The visitors were dismisse for 329 and Jimmy is on a hat-trick in the second dig. With 40 minutes to bat before lunch, England went at better than a run a minute without loss. Jennings was the less convincing of the two in the opening exchanges before getting into his stride in the quarter hour before lunch. Bumrah was the man most likely to make an incision but it wasn’t to be. An opportunity missed for India. I’m going to grab a quick bite before returning to your emails. If you can’t get enough of our Vic Marks on TMS this week, here is an extended interview that Geoff Lemon and I did with him about his life in the game on our Guardian Ashes pod last December. 9th over: England 46-0 (Cook 21, Jennings 20) Bumrah is swung around to bowl the final over, replacing Shami and beats Cook first up outside the off-stump with a good’un. In fact, the opener may have just pulled inside the line. Good cricket from all invovled. Cook continues his positive start, pushing into the 20s before the break with a pair of clips through midwicket, the first worth two the next three. That’s his happy place. Jennings leaves the final ball of the session and that is lunch. A 90-minute session where it all went right for the home side. 8th over: England 41-0 (Cook 16, Jennings 20) Ashwin on for one over before lunch, delivering to Cook. That stoush from Edgbaston didn’t have much of a chance to evolve at Lord’s with the opener out before the tweaker was used, from memory. So this should be good. Not this time around though, Cook taking the one on offer to mid-off first ball. Jennings does well defending from the crease, tucking a couple to midwicket when the spinner lands too straight. The tourists will get one more in before they lunch. 7th over: England 38-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 18) 38 runs in seven overs after ripping through the tail with 4/22 earlier - a great morning for the hosts. Jennings is looking more comfortable after the driven boundary in Shami’s previous set, pushing two to begin then steering another four behind point. It’s described as an edge on the radio but I reckon he was in control. He deflects a couple more in that direction to finish. Solid. 6th over: England 30-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 10) Luuurvely off-drive from Ali Ali Cook; no need to run for that. Bumrah is really bending his back to try and prompt a hurried stroke, which might explain why he overstepped with what would have been his final delivery. “England will be delighted with this,” says Swann of the start in conditions where the Indian seamers should be getting busy with at least one early scalp. “It’s looking like anything over 250 today would be a bonus for England,” writes Brian Withington. “Indeed, avoiding the follow on may not be a given. Time for Cook to grind like he’s never ground before - especially at this ground.” Bit early for that kind of pessimism, isn’t it? I’ll backing Cook in on the evidence of the last couple of overs. 5th over: England 25-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 10) Much better, Cook putting away a short delivery through cover point with ease. Shami hits back with one that darts off the seam and finds the veteran’s inside edge, not missing his stumps by far. Jennings’ turn and it is a second boundary out to cover, this time driven along the carpet with confidence. That’ll do the junior partner the world of good with 15 minutes to lunch. “I have lived in Spain for thirteen summers and not seen so much as a sightscreen,” Justin Horton tweeted at Tim. “Football lasts ninety minutes: the locals here couldn’t be attracted by a game taking several days to play, because, especially in summer, they had to work.” 4th over: England 16-0 (Cook 6, Jennings 6) Bumrah getting the ball through at good pace. He’s maintaining a straight line to Cook, forced to use his bat early in the over. A nice clip from him puts Jennings back at the business end and he’s immediately hit on the pad and there’s a big shout! Turned down by Umpire Gaffaney. No review and that’s confirmed by the TV replay as the right call as it was a fraction high. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 6) Afternoon to you all from Trent Bridge. Tim will be back with us later today. For now, Shami is running away from me with my seat right over his arm in the press box. Jennings is far from set, beaten by a full delivery that doesn’t carry to the wicketkeeper Pant. This is a vital innings for the left-hander with Ed Smith clearly happy to drop players earlier rather than later. Maiden. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 6) Jennings edges again, as Bumrah finds some lift with his first ball, and what should have been an easy catch at fourth slip becomes yet another four to third man. Kohli then plugs the gap, bearing out Nasser’s theory that he’s a stable-door captain. And Pant fumbles another take. A comedy of errors, which Adam Collins will now report for you. See you after tea, if the game lasts that long. 1st over: England 10-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 1) Mohammed Shami opens up, and Alastair Cook edges the first ball – wide of Kohli at third slip and away for four. “Cook has as many Test wickets as fifties here at Trent Bridge,” Mike Atherton notes, with some relish. Keaton Jennings too gets off the mark with a false shot, a leading edge to a full in swinger. And the last ball brings four byes to open Pant’s account as a keeper, though he did well to get a glove to it. Kim Thonger has started something with his email about why the Spanish don’t play cricket. “They do,” says Adrian Armstrong. “See www.cricketspain.es, which also includes a brief outline of the game’s history in Spain. Apparently things didn’t really develop until 1975, which leads me to wonder whether cricket might have been banned - or at least officially disapproved of - under Franco.” A suggestion from Ian Sergeant. “If Kim could get over to the barossa beach (just south of Cadiz) in a couple of hours, we’ll get a game going on the beach. Tide will be right out by then.” “Kim Thonger should consider,” says Geoff, “that having lunch from 2 until 4 followed by an hour or two of siesta might cut into a day’s play.” “George Bernard Shaw reckoned that the English, not being a very spiritual people, invented cricket to give themselves some idea of eternity,” says Peter Wood. “The Spanish, by contrast, have had no such need.” So India, with a strong lower order on paper, have made 23-4 today. Broad finishes with 3-72, Anderson with 3-64, and the second new ball has done the trick for England, perhaps because the Indians hadn’t seen one for several months. It’s England whose tails are up, but it’s India who have runs in the bank. Game very much on. Anderson produces a ball that is far too good for Bumrah, pitching middle, swinging away to hit middle and send both bails flying. Clinical stuff from the two old geezers. Shami goes for the old yahoo, grazes the clouds, and presents Broad with a simple catch at mid-on. 92nd over: India 329-8 (Sharma 1, Shami 3) Broad dispatches Ashwin and beats Sharma all ends up. In between, Shami does well to drive another full inswinger for three. But the Indians may not be too sad to see this booming swing. Could be a lot of wickets today. S Broad tries the inswinger, and it’s a beauty, ripping out R Ashwin’s middle stump. 91st over: India 326-7 (Ashwin 14, Sharma 1) A fine over from Anderson, who is swinging it like Anderson, ends in a dropped catch as Ashwin edges yet again and Pope spills it, low to his left, at fourth slip. It was sharp but not impossible. Here’s Mac Millings, responding to my point in the 89th over. “I think cricket is such that the fact that leg byes shouldn’t exist means that they should.” That may be peak OBO. 91st over: India 323-7 (Ashwin 12, Sharma 0) After a curious little delay caused by a flappy sock, Broad gets rid of Pant. But that was a highly promising 20 from a 20-year-old, the third of the series following Curran and Pope. Pant has all the shots, and he also seems to know when not to play them, which made his demise unexpected. Broad gave him a send-off, which was graceless, but perhaps a compliment. Jeff Docherty picks up on John Starbuck’s point (11:14). “Has Mr S had a tipple, a late evening or just lost track of time? Hadlee began his Trent Bridge career in 1978! In recent times the pitch has become famous for its batting virtues... England have broken two ODI world records there. However it is true that many previously fast pitches have ‘lost’ their zip, as flamboyant batting is generally favoured over bowling.” Broad pitches it up and, as if by magic, Pant drags it on. 90th over: India 323-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 12) Ashwin, apparently determined to score all his runs through the cordon, squirts a four past gully, but he was in reasonable control, playing it late. And then he edges past third slip for four more. Nasser is banging on about England’s old firm bowling too short, quite rightly. Where’s Sam Curran when you need him? “The rain in Spain,” says an email subject line. It’s Kim Thonger. “Writing from the terrace of the Alcazar in Segovia, nursing the first beer of the day (we’re an hour ahead, shush), richly deserved after climbing 203 steps to the top of the cathedral tower. A bit like Wayne Daniel’s run-up, only vertical. Anyway, my question is, why don’t the Spanish play cricket? They have the weather, the beer, the potential for dry turning pitches and a splendidly laidback attitude worthy of Sir Vivian Richards. Or perhaps they do play somewhere? I need enlightenment please.” 89th over: India 315-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 4) Broad’s over to Pant goes for just a couple of leg byes, which, as we established this time yesterday, shouldn’t exist. “Hello Tim.” Hello Andrew Benton. “A scan of relevant internet pages suggests only a handful of Test players have preferred to go by their initials over the years – M.J.K. Smith, M.S.K. Prasad, V.R.V. Singh, V.V.S Laxman amongst those leading the fray with three initials, and with Sir H.D.G. Leveson-Gower at number one, sporting a double-barrelled surname and a knighthood to boot. Isn’t there something a bit classy about going by your initials (?). A.J. Benton.” 89th over: India 313-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 4) You’ll never guess who’s bowling from the other end: Jimmy Anderson. Pant, standing outside his crease, Kohli-style, treats him with respect and takes another single to square leg off the last ball. An email from Patrick Morgan. “The R Ashwin discussion reminds me of X Billups, my fave character in To Kill a Mockingbird. But while Mr Ashwin (streaky four, there) simply prefers the use of his initial, Mr Billups is known as X because that is his given name. Cheers, P Morgan.” 88th over: India 312-6 (Pant 23, Ashwin 4) Broad gets one to jag away like a leg-break, but it’s well wide of off, and Pant isn’t a young man in such a hurry that he’s going to nibble at those in the first over. He dabs a single into the on side like an old pro. And then Ashwin flashes for four over second slip, where Jos Buttler’s instinct is to duck, but it’s probably out of reach anyway. “Despite the 1st day stumps score.” says Krish, “this match will be over by day 4 or maximum morning session of day 5. Indians in 2nd innings will start swinging their bats around, so it will not matter even if the ball does not swing.” You may well be right. The players are on the field, and Stuart Broad has the ball in his hand. He’ll be bowling to Rishabh Pant, so anything could happen. The county championship is back, not before time. And Graham Hardcastle is covering it for you. The start has gone back another 15 minutes, to 11.30. But who needs any play when there’s an email from John Starbuck? “‘Morning, Tim,” he murmurs, and yes, that is an apostrophe at the front. “The pitch doesn’t have to be slow. Indeed, during Richard Hadlee’s heyday here, all the pitches were notably fast. It looks like England rely too much on the swing side of bowling and hope for the right atmosphere. Granted, you can only do the best for the bowlers you have, but this can change rather faster than pitch preparation time allows. “Also, is there something about Mr Ashwin that means he has to be referred to as R? Ravi, or Ravichandran isn’t difficult to spell or pronounce. Some players are often known by their initials but this is usually for more than one e.g. KL Rahul, AB de Villiers etc.” It is, but he prefers to be just R Ashwin. Like J Hus, or O Henry. The moment of the day yesterday was Alastair Cook’s catch at first slip to break the big stand between Rahane and Kohli. He saw it so late – or sensed so late that Bairstow wasn’t going for it – that his body only moved towards the ball after his hand had nabbed it. “Trying to find a video of Cook’s much lauded catch yesterday, one that plays in my region (SE Asia),” writes Leo Nine. If you’re on Twitter, here’s a cheeky grab off the telly. And who are we to talk about that. Set fair? What kind of idiot would write that? There’s been some drizzle at Trent Bridge, and the start has been put back to 11.15. So we’ve got time to give this a spin – the Velvets at their most velvety. The first email of the day comes from somewhere in Germany. “Could you please show the link to the radio commentary,” asks David. With a bit of luck, it’s here. Morning everyone and welcome to the second day of the third Test. Sunday is the new Friday, and India are themselves again – making biggish runs after being put in to bat by Joe Root. A score of 307-6 was just what the Indians needed, and just what the series needed. They were wary and watchful, mostly playing the ball under their eyes, yet they still rattled along at three and a half an over. They even made it to the second new ball for the first time in the series. They lost Hardik Pandya to the last ball of the day, but they still have R Ashwin, far too classy to be down at No 8, and the dashing debutant Rishabh Pant, who bats as if he’s the love child of MS Dhoni and Virender Sehwag. It would serve England right if the game was taken away from them by a 20-year-old. The pitch is slow but even-handed, offering something for everyone except the raw pacemen that neither side has brought along. India could end up with anything from 330 to 500. Ideally, it’ll be around 350, which might lead to their being 100 ahead on first innings, if their seamers pitch it up like Woakes, or 100 behind if Root or Cook (or Woakes) gets the big score that eluded Kohli and Rahane. The weather is set fair, and so is the game."

          "bodyText": "It’s like Tinder but for the arts, and with benefits. Your phone shows you a picture teasingly described as likely to “arouse desire” – of a play, a film, a concert, a book, an instrument, a dance class – that is on, or available, in your neighbourhood. If it’s not for you, swipe left and the app serves up an alternative. If it is, swipe up to get more details, reserve a ticket or buy your copy. The bonus: if this is the year of your 18th birthday, it comes preloaded with €500 of culture credit. Four hundred young people in five départements are currently testing the technicalities of France’s new culture pass, which fulfils a campaign promise by President Emmanuel Macron to improve popular (and particularly youth) access to a broad range of cultural events, activities and goods. From late October, according to the culture ministry, which is running the €430m-a-year scheme, 10,000 young people will start using the app in real time in a six-month trial. The scheme is set to be rolled out nationally for all from next spring. With its key aim being to “encourage cultural discovery and diversification”, the project – 80% funded by the private sector, including potential partnerships with Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple – has prompted debate about what constitutes culture, and whether some kinds should be promoted over others. There have also been warnings that it risks running into the same problems as the “bonus cultura”, a similar scheme introduced in Italy in 2016 by the then prime minister, Matteo Renzi, which local media have reported was widely abused. Italian students not much inspired by the arts reportedly auctioned off their passes to the highest bidder on social media, while unscrupulous retailers exchanged culture credits for electronic items such as tablets, laptops and games consoles while ringing up the sales as weighty art books. France’s culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, said last month the French pass would involve “no cultural snobbism ... No cultural or artistic offering will be excluded. Every organisation active in the cultural arena will be welcome on the pass – public or private, physical or virtual.” But leading cultural figures have asked whether the French government should really be offering teenagers free tickets for Hollywood blockbusters, such as the latest episode in the Star Wars franchise. “All young people can go and see this kind of movie,” Richard Brunel, director of the national drama centre in Valence, told Le Monde. “It’s not necessary for it to be available on the pass.” Others disagree. “Culture in France is stuck in a kind of aristocracy,” said Fabrice de Boni, director of a successful web TV series. “Star Wars absolutely should be part of the culture pass’s offering.” If that argument appears to have been settled (Hollywood is popular culture and will be represented in all its guises, the culture ministry insists, and it will be up to independent and arthouse cinemas to find ways to use the app effectively), there will nonetheless be some “editorialising”. In principle, offers could range from a ticket for a Comédie Française performance to a week-long water-colour painting course, a school book on a cultural theme, a subscription to a major online music service, six weeks of hip-hop classes or even a critically applauded video game. But the algorithm is likely to lean towards public sector, independent and local offerings rather than content produced by Netflix or Spotify. It will also, unlike those companies’ apps, promote diversity of cultural experience rather than recommend similar products based on recent behaviour. Nyssen has also said she intends to set limits – yet to be defined – for certain kinds of expenditure on the app to ensure 18-year-olds do not spend all their credit on subscriptions to US streaming platforms. (Practical cultural activities will not be restricted, allowing young people to blow their €500 on drum lessons if they choose). “We will be asking for an extra effort from the very big players,” said Frédéric Jousset, a senior member of the project’s management team. “There’s no way this is going to turn into some sort of motorway for the digital majors.” While many have welcomed the scheme’s potential to expand the cultural horizons of France’s youth, it has plenty of critics, including the late Socialist president François Mitterrand’s influential former culture minister, Jack Lang. In an interview with French public radio, Lang said he was “not convinced” by the project as it stood. “In Italy, it was above all pure entertainment that benefited. Young people have not really been elevated culturally.” Lang said arts policy should be built on creativity. “We have to have confidence in arts organisations: when you see opera opening up to young people, museums almost becoming schools ... We should be encouraging them to open their doors wide, not promoting a sort of cultural consumerism.” Stéphane Troussel, a Socialist party politician in the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, where the app is being tested, also had his doubts. “Culture is a powerful mechanism for reducing inequalities,” he told Libération. “But it has to be accompanied. For the popular classes, access to culture is not just a financial issue. There needs to be some form of mediation, of preparation. It can’t just be a publicity announcement.”"

          "headline": "Why YouTubers are feeling the burn",
          "bodyText": "When Lucy Moon sat down with her therapist to discuss why she was feeling so low, she was on top of the world. A burgeoning career as a YouTuber was in mid-bloom: her subscriber count – an important metric on the site, and a sign of a creator’s popularity – was booming, and offers of work and brand tie-ins were rolling in. But all was not well. She wasn’t happy. The workload was rising; the pressure to be perfect in front of the camera was crushing. And the therapist was shocked. “She was like: ‘I cannot believe you think this is normal, to be running this kind of operation for the first time with no career support,’” says Moon, a 23-year-old beauty-and-lifestyle YouTuber with more than 319,000 subscribers. “I meet so many YouTubers who say that.” Despite the protestations of obsessive fans and dismissive naysayers, for the site’s most successful content creators, simply switching on a camera and spouting whatever comes to mind is no longer the entire job description. A YouTuber is a small-screen entrepreneur who must oversee growth in a highly competitive and ever-expanding market, win merchandise deals, broker brand tie-ins and often manage support staff. The pace of the site’s success has outstripped the behind-the-scenes support for creators, leaving them to perform a growing number of tasks with little help, all while success is fleeting and based on an ever-changing engine running the site: the algorithm. YouTube’s long-standing lack of transparency about how its algorithm works has caused YouTubers untold hours of stress over the years, as they try to second-guess the constantly changing mathematics that govern how their content is displayed. “YouTube’s algorithms prefer channels that have regular uploads and a narrow focus in terms of content,” explains Zoe Glatt, a PhD researcher conducting a digital ethnography of YouTube creators at the London School of Economics. “Creators are encouraged to pursue a quantity-over-quality approach if they want to achieve success on YouTube. This, combined with a lack of clarity about what content exactly YouTube will promote and what might be demonetised, leads to an extremely precarious and stressful working life for creators.” The algorithmic uncertainty can also cause creative minds to lean towards conservatism in an attempt to keep viewing numbers buoyant. “People are worried about taking risks, so a lot of the content feels quite similar,” says Charlie McDonnell, who has burned out on the site several times in his 11-year YouTube career. As you’d expect for a cohort of creatives whose lives are spent in front of the camera, pouring out their hopes and fears to a capricious audience, YouTubers aren’t suffering in silence. McDonnell has opened up about his mental health issues to his fans, and explained why he has taken time off from the site. “Sometimes that can be a fulfilling thing to do, to share, but I do think you have to pace yourself,” he says. Some are not heeding his call for caution. An increasing number of YouTubers are expressing concerns for their mental health in front of the camera. They are opening up about the behind-the-scenes stresses of a life lived in the online limelight. In late July, Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, the most successful YouTuber on the planet, uploaded a video to his 64 million subscribers explaining his fear about taking a break from the punishing schedule of posting. “You realise you can’t take a break,” he said. “If you take a break, your numbers” – the number of viewers watching your video, helped by YouTube’s algorithm displaying videos to casual viewers – “will fall.” Having “the burnout talk” with your viewers has become an odd badge of honour for YouTubers. The Try Guys, a collective of four former BuzzFeed staff members who gained success on the site for their quirky, laddish challenges, recently set out on their own – but quickly found the challenges of setting up a small business were greater than expected. “It’s one of those triangles where you choose two,” Zach Kornfeld, one of the four Try Guys, told his audience in a video explaining why they struck out as an independent group. “You can make a lot of videos, good videos, or be a sane, normal person.” As he mentioned each of these options, a corresponding visual representation of them appeared on screen. “I guess,” he said, flicking away the one reading “maintain sanity”, “I’m choosing those two.” That’s because as the pool of videos continues to grow, the chance of making a splash becomes more difficult. “It’s gotten harder simply because there are so many more people creating content,” says Matt Gielen of Little Monster Media Company, an agency that helps people build a YouTube audience. “The number of people distributing content on to YouTube has exploded in the last few years.” Which means those who want to succeed have to do more, do it more often and do it better. “Creators are pushed to work ever harder and churn out more content of a higher quality than others in order to garner and maintain success,” says Glatt. “It used to be you could build a decent-sized audience with one three-minute video per week,” says Gielen. His research shows that most creators now need to post at least three videos of between 10 and 12 minutes each week in order to be boosted by the algorithm. That’s an enormous change since 27-year-old McDonnell, a British YouTuber now based in Canada who specialises in science videos, debuted on the site in 2007. “When I started, if you had a video longer than four minutes, you probably weren’t going to watch it,” he says. “Now it’s a norm to upload videos that are eight minutes, 10 minutes, 12 minutes long.” The content has changed too as competition has increased. When 26-year-old Emma Blackery started uploading videos in 2012, she was unique. “There wasn’t really a female British comedian on YouTube. I was the only one doing it,” she says. “Now everyone’s a YouTuber, or if they’re not, they know a YouTuber. You have to stand out, which is why people do more extreme things and more daring videos.” It’s a vicious cycle. We know about burnout among YouTube creators precisely because of the site’s raison d’être: it encourages an uncomfortable intimacy. Baring your soul to the camera is seen as normal – just part of the churn of content passing through the giant YouTube sausage machine. But the long-lasting effects of a life shared online – warts and all – have yet to be investigated. (YouTube declined both an interview request and request for comment for this story; it confirmed it was launching an educational course on creator wellbeing later this year.) Meanwhile YouTubers continue to struggle and share, wondering whether it can all get better. “It can have a really negative impact on your life and the people who look up to you,” says Blackery. “I want to say I’m optimistic, but I don’t know.” Feeling the pressure: three case studies Lucy Moon Subscribers: 319,000 Beauty and lifestyle blogger covering fashion, sex, and therapy on her YouTube channel I got really lucky. I graduated from uni and was looking for jobs. I thought, I can do this for three months and keep it up, and see if it can make me any money. I gained enough subscribers and enough momentum that it just became my job. The biggest misconception is that YouTubers don’t have a career, they just make videos. In 2017 I did two months where I made 30 or 31 videos a month – on top of teaching myself how to run a business. Hardly any of my working week is in front of the camera. I was trying to do all the stuff like sourcing merchandise, meetings, the extra stuff. I hadn’t expected it to take such a toll on my mental health. I was in a bad sleeping schedule, I wasn’t eating enough, I was in a daze, I was trying to get sober. You don’t really want to be sitting down and putting your life on the table, saying: “Hello, I have all these problems and this is why I can’t make videos just right now.” It’s a difficult one because you never want to seem ungrateful. With YouTubers there’s a big guilt complex: “I’m not working hard enough, I should be really grateful for this life.” I don’t know a single YouTuber who hasn’t had a burnout in some form or another. I know lots of people whose burnout led to them being scared off the platform entirely. You’re telling everyone online you’ve got a perfect life. You’re putting out perfect images. You look like you’re having an incredible time. Emma Blackery Subscribers: 1.47 million A comedian and musician, Emma Blackery makes videos about internet culture and her life in Essex I get told every single day: “Poor you, it must be so difficult being a creator, working from home.” I’m kind of over trying to convince people it’s stressful and hard, because they don’t believe you anyway. Right now I’m trying to upload two videos a week as well as running two companies, a record label, preparing for the release of my album, making music videos, preparing for interviews and things like that. It’s a full-time thing. It doesn’t really stop. You’re always switched on. If a video does really, really well, you’re happy with that success. When that next video comes out and doesn’t get as many views, you think: “What did I do wrong?” You immediately think, I screwed up, I messed up, while it could be anything. It could be people not being online at the time you posted, or the algorithm not showing the videos on subscription feeds. But we all blame ourselves. There is this massive adapt-or-die [philosophy] with YouTube but the problem is, they don’t tell us how to adapt. There are so many people who quit their full-time job because they were doing well enough to support themselves. Then the algorithm changes and suddenly they can’t support themselves any more. You’re always thinking about the views you get, whether you’re relevant any more. You look at other creators coming up and think: “What are they doing that I’m not doing?” Charlie McDonnell Subscribers: 2.2 million Charlie McDonnell has been on YouTube for over a decade, making short films and videos covering travel and science I experienced burnout about five years ago for the first time. I was only uploading once a week but putting a lot of effort into it. Eventually it just got to a point where I exhausted myself. There’s a pressure to upload as frequently as possible. I find it hard enough to upload once a week; I can only imagine what it must be like to try to do that every single day. I tried doing it and I began to feel like I wasn’t really present in my own life. In one of my more recent videos I uploaded, I was talking about how weird it is that when you haven’t uploaded a video in a while the comment you get most frequently is: “Are you dead?” It seems funny on the surface but when you dig deeper into it, it’s uncomfortable to think that maybe people equate the regularity of my YouTube content with my actual physical life. I’m hesitant to badmouth the algorithm too much. I feel like YouTubers can use it as a bit of a scapegoat sometimes, because it feels like an unknown thing. But at the same time, as far as I’m aware, YouTube does prefer it if you’re uploading on a regular basis. Creating longer videos means you’re more likely to do well in terms of the watch-time metric YouTube incorporates. I worry about people being put in a position where they feel like they have to make a video today but they are having a really bad time, but they need content, so they say: “I guess I’ll talk about this bad thing I’m going through today.”"

          "bodyText": "Streets throughout the Netherlands are being unofficially renamed by activists in honour of venerated women after research showed that 88% of roads in large cities carry men’s names. Signs bearing the names of female resistance fighters, mathematicians, writers and musicians, are being put up by the feminist group De Bovengrondse, which translates as “above ground”. The movement was inspired by a survey by the news website De Correspondent, which found that only 12% of streets in Amsterdam, Utrecht and Groningen, were named after women. Often these were goddesses or the wives of famous men. On a website dedicated to the campaign, the group says: “Street names are an overview of who our society decides to honour, and that is why we think it is time to change these relationships. What would it be like if more people literally felt at home with the name of a strong woman?” The first 12 women who were honoured by the group during a renaming session in Amsterdam include Ada Lovelace, the British mathematician who designed the first algorithm, Marie Anne Tellegen, a Dutch resistance fighter and Beyoncé, described by the group as “one of the most famous icons of our time” who has “made feminism and the position of Afro-Americans an explicit subject of her work”. Rokin, a central thoroughfare in Amsterdam, has had a sign installed bearing the name Beyoncé Boulevard. The initiative has now moved on to Rotterdam, Groningen, Utrecht and elsewhere, with the aim of renaming thousands of streets. The group is placing the new street signs under the existing ones, to emphasise that the purpose is not forcing men to give way. The stated aim is to make people think and encourage the municipality to consider female alternatives when naming new housing estates. Santi van den Toorn, one of the movement’s founders, told the Het Parool newspaper: “It is always said that it is logical that there are so many male street names because history is written by men but there were also important women. “The street names are of course only part of a bigger problem, but everyone lives in a street, so everyone understands this.” A picture caption was amended on 10 August 2018 to correct a reference to the Argentinian composer Tania León"

          "bodyText": "Mark Evans catches the No 47 bus from the Bullring once a week every week. He gets on at the same stop, at the same time, on the same day. Mark walks with a stick and needs a seat, so he was disappointed to find it was standing room only last Saturday morning, when the passengers were packed so tight they were pressed right up against the driver’s glass divide. “Bloody hell,” he said as he fought his way on, “where’s everyone off to then?” There were clues if you knew what to look for, all those light blue and bright white shirts, the sun hats, bags stuffed with snacks, and snatches of conversation. “Root just isn’t ruthless enough” and “the new boy Curran batted well though, didn’t he?” Test match fans tend to be thanatophobic. They are absolutely obsessed with morbid thoughts about the sport’s impending death. There were a few empty seats at Edgbaston – the ground was around three-quarters full on each of the four days – which sparked a panic about the state of the game. Mark isn’t a Guardian reader, but if he were, he could have read about all the no-shows and swaths of empty seats at the Test match in this same paper that same day, if only all the cricket fans travelling out to Edgbaston had allowed him room to spread out the pages. Odd thing is, it’s not true, or even close to it. Test match crowds are bigger now than they have been at any point since the 1950s, when the authorities would push in the boundary ropes to allow people to sit on the grass verges. In Simon Wilde’s excellent new biography of the England cricket team, there is a table of Test match attendances in England over the past 40 years. It shows the average gate at an England Test was 52,851 in the 1980s, 63,853 in the 1990s, 72,568 in the 2000s, and 77,418 in the 2010s. So, in that time, the average gate at an English Test match has risen by 46%. There are some variations in among the numbers. Crowds are definitely down at Headingley from 59,008 in the 1980s, to 43,041 in this decade but the overall trend is that the numbers are up. A lot. Lord’s used to draw 70,231, and now gets 110,230, the Oval has gone up from 50,260 to 90,693, Edgbaston from 47,205 to 66,974. By that measure, Test match cricket has never been so popular in this country. Partly because the grounds have been redeveloped and are so much bigger now but also because, despite what our misty eyes tell us, the crowds were so much smaller back in the days everyone’s now so nostalgic about. If you really want to see what “swaths of empty seats” look like at an English Test ground take a few minutes to watch the YouTube footage of India’s Test tour from 1974. Only 19,700 turned up to watch over five days of play in the first Test at Old Trafford that year. So the total attendance was only a thousand or so more than came along on just the opening day of last week’s match at Edgbaston. It was, Wilde writes, “reported to be the lowest attendance for a five-day Test in England” and it led to the ground being stripped of its automatic right to stage an Ashes Test. It is a similar story in Australia, where the last Ashes series drew bigger crowds than any other since 1936-37. A fact that didn’t stop Moeen Ali from saying, soon after, that the crowds were so “disappointing” the series had “really opened his eyes” to the threat to Test cricket. There’s a lot of this double-think going on. I do it myself. Crowds have never been so big and we’ve never been so worried that they are too small. Which isn’t to say Test cricket isn’t facing its challenges here. Only, the biggest of them isn’t that so few people are watching cricket in England, rather that so many are. The sport is so successful here, and in India and Australia, that a huge wealth gap has opened up between those teams and everyone else. Which means that for most of the countries who play it, Test cricket simply is not financially viable unless one of those three teams are involved. Because, of course, audiences really are shrinking in a lot of the other Test match countries. Which is why all this endless worrying may be for the good. All that angst is finally forcing the game to adapt to meet the challenges it faces around the rest of the world. So right now we are seeing a shift to day/night Tests, which will open it up outside of office hours, and four-day games, which can be fixed to run in regular slots from Thursday through to Sunday. Then there is the World Test Championship, which starts next July. That same Saturday the Edgbaston Test finished, the MCC launched a survey to find out what the public think about Test cricket. One of the first questions is ‘If you could describe Test cricket in a single word, what would it be?’ Google’s algorithm has a pretty clear suggestion. Its first autocomplete response for a search beginning “Is Test cricket …” is “dying”. A straw poll of the 70 odd people on the No 47 bus would have given you a very different answer. Mark might be the exception, of course. If it was dying, he might have said, it should hurry up and get on with it so he could grab a seat."

          "bodyText": "While not a household name, Factory Floor – the band Gabe Gurnsey co-founded 13 years ago – owned their niche: sleek industrial techno cut with acid basslines made for a club-oriented live outfit, with intoning guitarist Nik Void recalling a robot Nico. Gurnsey insists that his debut solo album is a departure. It is, kind of: a saxophone line by Peter Gordon turns up on Sweet Heat. The club cultures he draws from here are markedly warmer than the stern clank of FF. A succinct funk bassline lurks inside You Can, and Harder Rhythm pays subtle homage to Michael Jackson. Really, though, Gurnsey remains consistent. A drummer by trade, his rhythms are unfailingly relentless. In Void’s absence, Gurnsey’s partner, Matilda Morris, provides vocal anomie. Gurnsey has structured Physical like a night out: driving to the club, stepping outside for a cigarette. But as with FF, Physical works as a seamless loop. Not everything here is riveting: Gurnsey’s narrative arc is a little underdeveloped. Unlike your average dour beatmonger, however, Gurnsey has bags full of hooks. Heard a couple of times, Ultra Clear Sound’s refrain – “Crystal/ In the algorithm” – is hard to dislodge."

          "bodyText": "It’s August, when the talk is of holidays looming or just gone – and yet the question I find myself asking is not where, but whether. I’m less interested in where friends or colleagues are going than whether they will fully unplug. Will they stay off their phones and, specifically, off Twitter and Facebook? I’m filled with admiration for the pal who stayed off the tweets a full month, only now gradually re-entering that realm, blinking into the darkness. That took some serious willpower. How funny to think that we once regarded the humble email device as addictive – the CrackBerry, we called it – when, in fact, those machines exerted a tiny pull next to the iron grip of social media on a smartphone. The BlackBerry was a post-dinner cigarette compared to the full smack habit that is hand-held Twitter. How compulsive is it? Let me take you to a golden summer’s evening in Hyde Park, for last month’s farewell concert by Paul Simon. Most of the crowd were rapt, absorbing this swansong by a musical legend. But in front of me was a woman who, clearly enough of a Simon enthusiast to have bought an expensive ticket, nevertheless pulled out her phone every 20 or 30 seconds. Four or five times during each song. She was not using it to take photos of the performance. (I was close enough, and distracted enough, to see.) She was, instead, scrolling through social media updates, thumbing her way through observations about the news – including factoids about France’s World Cup victory that afternoon. Even when Simon closed with The Sound of Silence – a transcendent, transporting moment – she couldn’t help it: she reached for the phone. She needed one more fix. Where there is anecdote, there is also data. On Thursday Ofcom reported that the average Briton checks their smartphone every 12 minutes – which obviously means plenty are checking it much more often than that. Britons are spending an average of 24 hours online each week, with one in four clocking up 40 hours. There are obvious reasons why this might be bad, reasons of both time and space. The time suckage is striking. I know myself how quickly an hour or more can disappear down a Twitter rabbit hole. (I’ve never really done Facebook, but I confess to a Twitter problem: I still like the speed, range of stories and expertise I’d otherwise miss.) Think of all the conversations you could have had, the books you could have read, when instead you were going deep into some thread you’ll have forgotten seconds later. I recall the cartoon of the man who won’t go to bed, even when summoned by his partner. “I can’t, this is important,” he explains. What is it? “Someone is wrong on the internet.” But it’s also the view out of the train window that you never saw, because your head was down, staring at that glowing screen. Still, that, frankly, is the least of the harm. The real problem is that “addiction makes people crazy”, to quote internet pioneer Jaron Lanier, author of a polemic published this summer: Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. Just look at how people who are otherwise sane and courteous behave online: the arguments, the sarcasm, the aggression, the abuse. Of course human beings have always been capable of fighting, but something strange happens on social media. For one thing, confrontation on the screen happens more often than it ever would in our daily lives. Put a device in people’s hands, and suddenly they’re on a hair-trigger – either giving or taking offence. One crucial factor is social media’s ability to stage a confrontation in public. Suddenly two individuals will be slugging it out in front of everyone else. If they’re famous, someone will post a gif of Michael Jackson munching popcorn. This has no counterpart in real, or pre-Twitter, life. In the past, TV might have hosted a bust-up between two antagonists. But the spontaneous, genuine row unfolding in real-time in front of a mass audience: that’s new. And those exchanges often descend into the toxic. The instant they shift to Direct Message mode – without an audience – they become calmer and more considered, freer of performance and posturing. But on the platform, in public view, Lanier is right: even good people rapidly become “assholes”. If they have something else at stake – for example, their career prospects when they post on LinkedIn – they tend to behave better, he says. But when it’s just sounding off about politics, broadly defined, the asshole within reigns supreme. Part of the problem is the lack of context. On social media, people too often approach a statement as if it is the very first that person has made (unless, of course, they want to expose the tweeter as a hypocrite, by revealing the contradiction with thoughts posted earlier). Sometimes the results are comic – when a bloke in the pub is telling a nuclear weapons engineer how nukes work – but more often it’s just infuriating. So you’re denounced for “failing to address” x, when you have, in fact, been addressing x for years and, indeed, addressed it in a tweet posted a matter of minutes earlier. It’s partly this lack of context that explains the aggressive atmosphere. Those we know well need do little to gain our attention; those we don’t have to shout and scream and swear to get noticed. And all this is before you get to the proven, documented abuse and manipulation of these platforms by people who mean us harm, as revealed by my Observer colleague Carole Cadwalladr in her exposés of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: witness the Russia-backed content that reached 126 million Americans via Facebook during the 2016 presidential election. But the truth is, the problem lies not with abuse of the medium, but with the medium itself. Addiction was built into social media’s design from the start – recall former Facebook president Sean Parker describing the “little dopamine hit” the product gives users to keep them hooked – and so too was the anger. The feedback algorithm rewards “engagement”, and a swift, vicious denunciation registers as engagement of a particularly intense kind. Lanier notes that an unintended consequence of Black Lives Matter was that, thanks to the algorithm, it connected its fiercest opponents with each other online, fuelling and cohering the resurgent white supremacist movement we see today. Philosophically, the right people to blame for these products are their producers, not their consumers – just as we ought to blame junk food manufacturers for obesity, rather than railing against individuals for insufficient willpower. That makes moral sense and we should push the tech giants to change. And yet, for some of us, that change will not come quickly enough. Deleting our accounts – total abstinence – might feel like too great a leap, but an August holiday presents an opportunity, if not to delete then at least to detox. So when the time comes to pack my bags later this month, I’ll be taking sunscreen, a few novels, but no Twitter. I’ll listen instead to the sound of silence. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "Facebook should consider completely removing news from users’ feeds unless it can find a way to avoid low-quality stories clogging up the site, the chief executive of the New York Times has said. Mark Thompson said he was “terrified” by Facebook’s attempts to use algorithms to rank the quality of news outlets, warning that “a machine entirely behind closed doors is going to rank the world’s news sources” and that publications would be ranked at the top only for as long as they remained “in the good books of Facebook”. “All of that sounds like a controlled society,” said Thompson, a former director general of the BBC. “The first thing I think they can do is work with us to help users make decisions about who to trust and who not to trust. I don’t want a special pass saying we’re going to be trusted more than others. I want to win people’s trust by people understanding what we’re trying to do. “We want to create these environments where people have got a chance to make a critical judgment,” he said of Facebook’s attempt to fight disinformation on its platform. “If it can’t be done with something like the Facebook feed then don’t put news on it. If it’s not possible to do it in a way where it’s going to be contextually understood then just use cat videos. If it’s too hard a puzzle then don’t do it.” Asked whether Facebook should stop promoting news altogether if it could not find a solution to the many problems facing the site, Thompson replied: “I don’t think that’s a crazy idea.” Such a scorched earth approach is unusual in a media industry that spent the last five years chasing millions of readers via Facebook, only to watch as the traffic fell away this year when Mark Zuckerberg’s company changed the way its algorithm promotes news on the network. But Thompson is joining a raft of media executives who are looking at life beyond Facebook in the wake of a series of scandals and questions over the sustainability of online news business models. They are trying to ensure their news outlets survive by building a direct relationship with their readers and then asking those readers to pay for quality journalism. “I think we have a disagreement about what journalism is,” said the executive, who does not have either a Twitter or Facebook account. “Silicon Valley began with a very simple idea of what news was – they thought it was a series of news events. A ship sinks, a building burns down, there’s an earthquake – and news stories were reporting the facts about these events. You’d have 10 events and lots of different outlets reporting the events and the individual reports were interchangeable. “It’s a crude and positive view of what news is. News is a sophisticated cultural object, it’s very nuanced. Most news stories relate to long-term stories which roll out over years, such as Brexit, the Trump administration or global warming. The ideal relationship a reader has with a news provider is a long-term relationship where they understand the context; they’ve got used to the different voices; they’ve got their criticisms.” The 61-year-old took over as chief executive of the New York Times in 2012, shortly after it put the majority of its site behind a paywall – a decision that many pundits felt was doomed to fail. The website allows readers to access five articles a month before they have to subscribe. Aided by its coverage of Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein, it now has a total of 4 million paid subscribers, including 400,000 who pay for its crossword and cooking section alone, helping to overcome enormous falls in print revenue. The UK subscriber base is in the “tens of thousands”, but the paper is looking to expand globally and its UK operation now employs about 50 journalists. Thompson says the paper’s culture has more in common with the BBC than the rough and tumble world of UK newspapers – pointing out that there is “a lot more fact-checking” than on Fleet Street. “I started reading the New York Times in the 1980s,” he said. “The Times in those days was a very complete part of people’s lives; it was news and opinion and incredibly agenda-setting. It has something of a Radio 4 quality for its heartland audience. What we’re trying to do is to recreate the indispensability of the Times on a smartphone – that’s no mean task.” The revamp has involved an investment in podcasts such as the highly successful The Daily and some adjustment to how the paper presents its reporting. Thompson despaired after sitting in one-on-one focus groups where one reader, seemingly unaware of the extent of the paper’s foreign coverage but impressed by its digital rivals, said: “You should do what Vice do and get people to leave New York and cover wars.” Asked about the future of the newspaper industry, Thompson predicted a bloodbath, with mid-sized newspapers obliterated during the transition to digital. Thompson said he spent more time looking at the business models of Spotify and Netflix than other news outlets. “In the US it may be that only two or three titles survive, other than specialists. The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have all got decent chances,” he said. This meltdown was likely to be replicated in the UK, he said, with only outlets that can convince readers to pay for high-quality journalism able to survive as print newspaper revenue collapses. “I don’t think there’s room for every national newspaper to succeed and arguably they’re not succeeding today. How long people want to throw money at that – who knows?” Thompson is concerned about changing British attitudes towards the BBC and warns that as regional newspapers collapse, “the case for a universally freely available backstop of quality journalism on TV, radio and the web feels like it’s strengthened.” Thompson, who said he paid to read the Guardian and also checked the New Statesman, Financial Times and BBC, warned of what has already happened in the US, where swathes of local government actions go unreported and uncriticised. “It’s a precious thing the UK’s got and I sometimes wonder if it knows [that].” For now he still has to contend with his outlet’s most publicly critical reader – one fond of tweeting about the “failing New York Times” despite coming to lunch at the newspaper and calling it a “jewel for America and the world”. Judging by the timing of Trump’s tweets and the stories he chooses from the White House bedroom, Thompson believes Trump is a fan of the print edition rather than the website. Thompson said: “We’ve got a faded photograph of Richard Nixon in our boardroom signed by him. It says: ‘Some people read the Times and like it, some people read the Times and don’t like it, but everyone reads the Times.’ As for Donald, he reads it.”"

          "bodyText": "It’s difficult to use words like success or failure to describe a Netflix original movie since the streaming platform remains reticent over sharing any concrete viewing figures. But even without such data, it was clear that June’s sprightly rom-com Set It Up was a rare triumph, garnering warm reviews and a lingering online buzz, stronger than some of their starrier, more expensive affairs. Arriving soon after, there’s a similar comfort food quality to their latest formulaic comedy Like Father, a mostly likable if wholly unremarkable heap of froth. Kristen Bell stars as Rachel, a workaholic New Yorker who we first see taking an important work call ... right before she heads up the aisle. Keeping her phone at hand as she prepares to get married, her fiance sees it as the last straw and, with their friends and family watching, dumps her. Trying, and failing, to maintain a professional veneer back in the office, she soon falls into a pit of self-pitying and alcohol which leads her to a bar with estranged father Harry (Kelsey Grammer). The two spend all night drinking and make the drunken decision to take the pre-booked honeymoon cruise together. The morning after, out at sea, the vacation seems somewhat less amusing ... If reports are to be believed, then an integral step in Netflix’s creative decision-making process is a thorough examination of user behavior, noting what’s clicked on, watched, rewatched, downloaded and binged, meaning that we can only blame ourselves for the platform’s recent obsession with poorly made sci-fi schlock. When taking this into consideration, it’s easy to see why Like Father would be given a easy green light. It’s soft-hearted Sunday afternoon fodder that would struggle to get audiences out of their living rooms and into the cinema but as a no-stakes click at home, a no-brainer. Taken as such, it’s not without merit. Initially, there is something cosily charming about the algorithm-based shell within which it plays out, harking back to late 80s/early 90s comedies that don’t often get made anymore, at least not on such a scale. There’s a familiar soul-heavy soundtrack, opening credits that are overlaid on top of a sweeping shot of Manhattan and the knowledge that everything will play out in exactly the way you expect. Writer-director Lauren Miller Rogen, who co-wrote 2012’s fun, flimsy comedy For A Good Time, Call ... , has also picked a central duo who feel as familiar as the thinly etched plot that surrounds them. Grammer, enjoying his biggest movie role for quite some time, channels his considerable sitcom experience for a deadbeat dad role whose road to redemption could have been stretched over a two season arc. He shares an effortless chemistry with his on-screen daughter, played with a sharp edge by Bell, experiencing a career high with her role in The Good Place, arguably the best comedy on TV right now. After Veronica Mars, Bell had a rocky path on the big screen, too often positioned as a cutesy romantic lead, but when she’s allowed to get in touch with her saltier side, she’s far more effective. Speaking of salty, there’s a strange embrace of the unmoderated nature of Netflix originals, which don’t face the same certification worries that big screen releases encounter. It means that pretty much anything goes which can lead to films feeling less neutered but can also result in an odd dissonance. In Set It Up, the harmless PG-13-esque rom-com is suddenly interrupted by a character using the word cunt, something that would have meant an instant R rating in theaters. In Like Father, there’s a similar smattering of swear words (“I’m a fucking bride, you fucking cocksucker!”) that feel strange cushioned in such sentimental, risk-avoiding territory. Aside from some choice curses, the script doesn’t really glide past safe waters. There’s a “going through the motions” feel to much of it, as if it’s more of a screenwriting exercise than a screenplay with Miller Rogen refusing to delve that deep into the fractured relationship at the center and littering her film with tired cliches. New Yorkers are angry, Canadians are friendly, stoned old people are hilarious and there’s a regressively written gay couple complaining about carbs, flirting with straight men and making unfunny, lewd remarks (“I love anything gigantic!”). There are simple pleasures to be had here but one wishes there were more of them. It is nice to see a Netflix film with some aesthetic ambition (it’s as slickly filmed as a big screen comedy) and there’s a pair of undeniably accomplished performances (along with an amiable cameo from Miller Rogen’s husband Seth Rogen) but it doesn’t really amount to much. It’s an undemanding watch, easily digestible while on in the background, but even easier to forget. Like Father will be available on Netflix on 3 August"

          "headline": "The Beehive review – mystifying filmic mosaic of Juanita Nielsen's murder",
          "bodyText": "After 15 years of living next door to Kings Cross I decided to quit Sydney for the central coast. I had known the Cross pretty well, having visited its cafes, bookshops and nightclubs since I was a teenager in the 1970s. But by 2001 whatever romance I’d felt for the place was gone. From Friday to Sunday it had become a no-go area, a violent and lurid remnant of its former bohemian glory. Zanny Begg’s The Beehive (2018), a commissioned work by Artbank and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image that just opened in Melbourne, brings all those Kings Cross memories back. The experimental documentary is based around the 1975 disappearance of Juanita Nielsen, the community activist and street press publisher. Nielsen was part of a grassroots battle against the development of Victoria Street, which would see period terraces demolished for a vast apartment building. The battle pitted on one side, community and resident groups, Nielsen and her magazine NOW, and the Builders Labourers’ Federation; and on the other, a motley assortment of developers, ex-cops, gangsters and hired goons. With a ton of money at stake in the development, efforts to evict residents turned violent, with the head of the residents’ group kidnapped (and later released), and the destruction of residents’ homes. Among all this Nielsen cut a striking figure, a tall woman with a trademark beehive hairdo, a private school educated heir to the Mark Foy’s department store fortune, but the living embodiment of romantic revolutionary resistance. Nielsen is widely believed to have been murdered by gangsters, and although the guilty have never been brought to justice, her story is a significant moment in the history of resistance to the seemingly unstoppable forces of gentrification in Australia’s inner cities. For Begg, the story also serves as the starting point for a meditation on identity, history, community and collective memory. For her ambitious documentary project, Begg uses a few different approaches to tell the story, most of them documentary staples. There are talking heads – people who lived in the Cross, knew Nielsen and the gangsters, and were community organisers, strippers, coffee shop owners and neighbours. Then there’s a cast of 12 women who speak for and about Nielsen, a generation or two removed from the actual story but who reflect on its meanings and contemporary resonance. And there are some quasi re-enactments, featuring a variety of players portraying Cross heavies and gangsters. Tying this all together is actor Pamela Rabe as The Beekeeper, the doco’s on-screen narrator of various visual metaphors and narrative analogies. This latest work follows on from recent pieces by Begg, including 1001 Nights in Fairfield (2015) and City of Ladies (2017) – hybrid video art/documentary projects that foreground a non-traditional, non-linear method of storytelling. Visitors to ACMI’s gallery space are presented with a single screen video and a variety of chairs to sit and watch. The work is subject to an unseen software algorithm that reorders approximately 20 video sequences into a variety of iterations, a total of 1,344 possible versions of the work, running roughly 20 to 33 minutes each. The whole process is invisible and non-intrusive, only becoming apparent on subsequent re-watches, and even then not immediately obvious. As a metaphor for how history and memory are reshaped by subjectivity and conflicting accounts, the use of this iterative algorithm makes perfect conceptual sense. But as a viewing experience it’s slightly mystifying. I was constantly wondering how each iteration might differ. It became apparent that the documentary – or at least the four iterations that I watched – was presenting a version of events that privileged a simple and sometimes uncritical treatment of Nielsen and her time. The “whodunnit” part of the story is also perfunctory – and confusing. At least half a dozen suspects are named, and the murder is left as a question mark. The younger voices playing Nielsen add contemporary relevance and link community activism of the 70s to the way communities are established and prosper now, yet their views (scripted or not, I couldn’t tell) often seem romantic and naive. Imogen Kelly, a former stripper, community organiser and sex worker’s rights advocate and who was there and knew the key people, gives the story of the Cross in the 70s some badly needed nuance. The combination of voices is interesting, a mixture of wise heads and young kids, a little like the Cross in its prime. There is a very contemporary feel to The Beehive as it reflects current concerns and perspectives, and yet Begg’s work is reminiscent of feminist experimental filmmaking from the 70s and 80s, documentaries and polemical works such as Pat Fiske’s Rocking The Foundations (1985) and particularly Helen Grace’s Serious Undertakings (1983), radical movies made in the shadow of the events in Begg’s documentary. Artists making documentaries is now well established. Works such as Isaac Julien’s Ten Thousand Waves (2010), Richard Mosse’s The Enclave (2012–13) and Omar Chowdhury’s Ways (2014) explode viewer’s expectations of what a documentary can be simply because their images are spread across multiple screens, have extreme duration, and demand that the audience gets up and moves. As soon as an art project begins to resemble a more classically structured single-screen documentary, the more expectations of story and resolution come into play. To Begg’s credit, the work resists completion, leaving Nielsen’s story unresolved, a tangle of poetic allusions clashing with ugly street-level realities. Near the end of one iteration, Pamela Rabe switches out of her narrator clothes into the black-and-white striped top that signifies an actor is Nielsen. Solve the puzzle of my disappearance, she says, and we will save the soul of the city. For those of us who quit the city 20 years ago, that seems like a tall order. But the value of the claim, and Begg’s documentary, is that it keeps the very idea of resistance alive. • The Beehive by Zanny Begg is showing at Australian Centre for Moving Image in Melbourne until 4 November"

          "bodyText": "“Space is big,” wrote Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. “You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.” Adams’s assertion comes repeatedly to mind when reading David Sumpter’s Outnumbered, which attempts to reckon with the sheer scale of the systems that manage much of our digital lives. It’s easy, when faced with the numbers at hand, to succumb to a kind of vertigo: Facebook has two billion users, who make tens of millions of posts every hour. From this data, along with millions more photos, likes and relationships, Facebook builds models of all of us that extend in hundreds of dimensions – the puny human mind, at best, is capable of visualising four. Google’s translation systems likewise collapse hundreds of languages into multidimensional matrices of meaning, which generate their own metalanguages unknowable to us – and which contain their own implicit biases. Plugging the UK’s most popular baby names into one such system, designed to understand how words and concepts relate to each other, gives the response: “Oliver is to clever what Olivia is to flirtatious”. “Our future generations’ gender roles,” the author worries, “have already been assigned by the algorithm.” Sumpter is a professor of applied mathematics; his natural response to such problems is to recreate them and then unpack them – and perhaps deflate some of our wilder fears along the way. Step by step, using the same data as many of the papers he quotes from, he details the maths that underpins each of these systems, laying out the straightforward, if advanced, calculations that govern their outcomes – and their limitations. It’s all very well to apply sophisticated regression models to billions of Facebook likes, but the results are mostly underwhelming: yes, “Democrats are more likely to like Harry Potter” than Republicans, but “it doesn’t necessarily tell us that other Harry Potter fans like the Democrats”. The same no-nonsense approach is deployed to debunk lazy assertions that we are all fooled by fake news stories, or trapped within filter bubbles that mindlessly reassert our prejudices. We are, apparently, both smarter and more aware than that. It’s not just the supposed morons on social media who are subject to such pressures. Through constant reference to other systems, Sumpter demolishes any idea that our current social media woes are the fault of, or even originate with, Facebook and its ilk. Google Scholar, a search engine for academic papers, ranks academic influence by the number of citations each paper receives, leading to hit-chasing research and poor funding decisions. The supposed experts who dabble in online prediction markets are just as susceptible to randomness in polling data as the rest of us. In example after example, the toxic combination of filter bubbles, simplistic ranking mechanisms and algorithmic recommendation is seen as clearly in elite networks as in more accessible but supposedly less self-aware groups – but, we are told, the effects really aren’t as bad as we’re being told they are: “When we get time for research, we scientists still do it well. Most scientists I meet are motivated by the eternal search for truth and the desire to know the right answer.” Phew. Outnumbered is certainly timely: its research led Sumpter to question the role of Cambridge Analytica, and wangle an interview with its prime researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, long before the furore about its operations reached their peak. He is ultimately quite dismissive of CA’s role in the US election: our belief in its methods and their efficacy, he argues, owes more to the inflated claims of its management than any mathematical rigour. But focusing on the maths alone results in a one‑dimensional view of the role of such emergent, complex systems in everyday life. In looking at the mathematical logic of fake news in the US and French elections, or the role of bots in the Brexit referendum, the far more fearful results of, say, online hate speech in Kenya, Sri Lanka or Myanmar are ignored. The latter are not the result of bad maths but they are its fallout: cultural blindness backed by a belief in technological determinism. The algorithms work in one context, think the good folk at Facebook and Google, so they will also work in another – until the platform is seized by demagogues, or used to censor and surveil entire nations. The suspicion arises that perhaps our algorithmic crisis isn’t a maths problem at all. It’s possible for mathematicians to be aware of this, of course, and Sumpter is at pains to stress his own privilege and limitations. His previous book, Soccermatics, was a fascinating and entertaining dive into the mathematics of the beautiful game – but football, as we all know, is a sport that, for all its sound and fury, chance and chaos, ultimately consists of two halves with a goal at each end. What happens on the pitch can, with difficulty but effectively, be quantified. What happens beyond its bounds cannot, and the unintended consequences of believing that it can be are legion. While always insisting that human oversight is essential within today’s algorithmic systems, Sumpter’s analysis seems unable to account for bad actors and those who, despite all the evidence, continue to conduct their lives on the basis of conspiracy theory, mistaken assumptions and lust for power. As one researcher notes, regarding the biases in language translation systems, “there is no real way of fixing the problems caused by unsupervised learning without fixing racism and sexism first”. Early in the book, there’s a brief mention of a piece of software developed by Google for generating targeted ads on YouTube. It enables brands to insert text and images into videos based on user profiles, in order to produce infinite tailored variations of their adverts, and thus increase their influence. Its name? “Vogon” – taken, without credit but unmistakably, from Douglas Adams, who bestowed it on the slug-like aliens who would demolish the Earth: “one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy – not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous”. Understanding the mathematics behind these complex systems will tell you a great deal, and an honest accounting will also reveal their limitations. But no amount of maths will help us regain the agency we’re losing to them every day, or face down those who would deliberately use their complexity against us.

          "headline": "Print advertising in UK national newspapers rises for first time since 2010, study finds",
          "bodyText": "National newspapers in the UK are experiencing the best start to a year in almost a decade, thanks to a combination of factors including an advertiser backlash against Facebook and Google. Print display advertising in the national newspaper market rose 1% to £153m in the first quarter of 2018, the first time there has been an increase since the last quarter of 2010. To put this in context, in the 29 quarters since the 2010 rise, more than half of national papers – 15 – have seen double-digit declines in advertising spend of up to 22%. The growth was delivered by advertisers targeting the popular titles, such as the Sun, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Daily Express and Metro, whose combined print display advertising rose 2.8% in the first quarter to £77.8m according to research from the Advertising Association and Warc. In the quality market, which includes the Times, Telegraph, Financial Times and Guardian, print display advertising fell 0.3% to £48m – the best quarterly performance in seven years. Overall for the full year, the report is forecasting the national newspaper market will fall 1.3%, again the best performance since 2010. “There is a renewed optimism and verve sweeping through the publishing market for the first time in many years,” said Adam Crow, the head of publishing investment at WPP-owned media agency MediaCom. “The market is a hive of activity from an advertiser investment perspective.” A number of factors have fuelled the improved performance, including a view among advertisers that they have pushed too much of their ad spend into social media. After issues including trust and brand safety, with ads running around inappropriate content, multinationals including Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, the world’s two biggest spenders on advertising, have been reassessing their spending with companies such as Facebook. Simon Fox, the chief executive of Mirror and Express owner Reach, said a positive and hopefully longer-term trend was a revival of spending on print advertising by the big supermarket chains. Supermarkets have traditionally been a key spender for national newspaper titles, but a couple of years ago they dramatically cut the amount they spent to focus more on social media. Fox cited Tesco as an example of one supermarket chain that had returned to national newspaper advertising with bigger budgets, saying that the “pendulum had swung back” from the huge focus on driving budgets into social media. The biggest national press advertisers in the first quarter were Sky, BT, Imagine Cruising, DFS and Asda, with a combined spend of almost £20m. Newspaper publishers have also aimed to put their differences aside to try and promote the medium, in print and digital, to fight back against the Silicon Valley companies. Recently, Times and Sun owners News UK, the Guardian and Telegraph announced a joint digital advertising sales venture, called Ozone, to offer advertisers more scale to better compete with Facebook and others. There has also been a lot of work developing a measurement system called Pamco to give advertisers the full picture of sales and readership of titles online and in print. But changes to Facebook’s algorithm in January hammered national newspaper digital advertising income in the first quarter, with growth of 4.1%, the slowest in two years. The increase in first-quarter print advertising did not extended to the beleaguered local newspaper market. On Monday, Reach, the UK’s largest regional newspaper owner, slashed £150m from the value of its titles, which include the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo, reflecting the tough outlook in the digital age."

          "bodyText": "If you’re not on Twitter, don’t start. It’s like smoking: highly addictive and no good will come of it. But if you are, log on and put “Elon Musk” in your handle. Twitter has had enough of fraudulent Musk imitators and has decided to put a stop to their merry japes. Your account will be immediately blocked until you’ve proved you’re a real person (which you do via a text to your phone). So there is no reason at all why Twitter couldn’t deal with hate speech, disruptive bots or Russian troll factories: all they’d need is a few Nazi keywords, a flag on anyone with a name like @GREATBRITISHSTEVE2876776, a quick Musk-style block and an identity check. There are anxieties, of course, around fixes that come from the social media platforms themselves. This leaves political and moral adjudication to tech giants, whose only known skill is virtual domination. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have no obvious competencies in ethics. But they could start really simply, by ejecting known racists and troll accounts. Sure, it’s a wide net that could easily ensnare the president of the United States, and who knows what mischief he’d be up to if he weren’t on Twitter. They could move on to the more generalised groups that simply sow bitter hatred and division with misinformation, those whom the Indian press recently called “mischief mongers”. We could gradually build an ethical code collectively, and make it so much more sophisticated than just flagging up swearwords but having an open-door policy on rape threats. Crucially, it’s not that hard: this is how civilisations are built and decency is maintained, by making trenchant decisions about what’s acceptable and what isn’t, not by endless equivalising between one person’s right to say whatever they want, and another’s right to a functional democracy. The MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport select committee have rightly been lauded across the world for their pluck and rigour in investigating “fake news”, dark ads and data abuse. If electoral meddling by a foreign power is wrong, its full extent has to be scoped. It cannot be filed under “modern, hyper-connected world”, along with Fortnite and eBay. Yet the committee’s characterisation of the internet as the “wild west”, along with some of its prescriptions – a micro “education” tax on Facebook et al, to be spent on telling 12-year-olds not to believe everything they read – plays into the narrative of our mutual helplessness. It implies that, since there’s nothing to be done about the spread of disinformation, we must all, individually, become better at recognising it for what it is. This approach – promulgated most consistently by Zuckerberg himself – is remarkable for its slacker fatalism. Zuckerberg explained recently that Facebook couldn’t take down posts that deny the Holocaust because “there are things that different people get wrong … I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong, but I think it’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent.” Until you can see into the mind of the person who insists that Auschwitz didn’t exist, you can’t impugn them. They may simply be mistaken. The proposition asks us to believe in a group of people who dispute a historical truth by mistake, who mean nothing by it and have no darker purpose in spreading it. We can recognise this studied impotence from other sectors, notably finance: there’s nothing to be done with the territory, because it is just too vast. How can I know the intentions of a billion users? And if we can’t control it, what can a state regulator, with a fraction of the money and a zillionth of the expertise, possibly achieve? It has been established as an unchallengeable status, to be too big to fail – charged with your failures, you simply insist upon your impossible bigness. A glance at Wikipedia is enough to expose the fallacy in this argument: it is within the bounds of human ingenuity to create online spaces defined by cooperation not discord, expertise not falsity, great reservoirs of shared knowledge. The civic tech entrepreneur Ed Saperia, who set up Newspeak House, a “community space for political technologists”, is supporting the work of PhD student Sophie Chesney in developing an algorithm for the detection of fake news. Explaain.com scans the content you’re reading and automatically links it to pop-up cards that check its veracity. Meanwhile a score of developers are mobilising from different angles against the spread of sheer mendacity that has plagued elections from here to the US, Canada to Nigeria. A flawed vision of online political activity is emerging. This world is seen as an inherently lawless place, where bad messages and big money can be funnelled into the web’s dark corners where no respectable person can see them. This is treated as an inevitability, boastfully by disruptors, ruefully by social media giants. So we arrive at the logical endpoint of free market fundamentalism. A social space that can’t be regulated, yet affects everything from voting to consuming; which obviates regulation altogether, while disempowering the individual by blaming them for failures of credulousness. The only flaw in this analysis is that we are not powerless. We have the same moral musculature we’ve always had. We are all agents in both analogue and digital terrains, and enough of us (not me) are ingenious in ways that snake-oil blowhards threatening an invasion of Turkish immigrants couldn’t begin to imagine. We are more than capable of fighting back. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Mirror parent slashes value of local newspapers by £150m",
          "bodyText": "The publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers slumped to a first half loss of more than £100m after slashing the value of regional titles, which include the Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail and Liverpool Echo. Reach, the new name for the publisher Trinity Mirror, wrote down the value of its 160 local papers and websites by £150m, reflecting the tough outlook for local newspapers in the digital age. The impairment charge drove Reach to a pretax loss of £114.3m in the first six months of the year, compared with a £38m profit in the same period last year. The UK’s largest publisher of local newspapers said it had cut the value of its portfolio by almost half – from £347m to £197m – to “reflect a more challenging outlook for our regional businesses”. Simon Fox, chief executive of Reach, said the write-down reflected the poor long-term outlook for print sales and readership, not digital opportunity for local titles. “It is about the print assets,” he said. “In terms of our regional digital strategy we are going into cities where we never had a print presence, like Leeds, and we are about to open in Edinburgh. Those are unrelated to the print assets we hold.”The company also saw a major slowdown in the growth of digital display and transactional revenues to 11.5%, £48m in total. It cited algorithm changes made by Silicon Valley giants Facebook and Google for the shift. “It was mainly Facebook but also a little bit Google,” Fox said. “Our ambition is for 20% digital growth so 11.5% is not good enough.” Reach, which earlier this year bought Richard Desmond’s Express and Star titles as well as OK! magazine for £200m, said that like-for-like revenues fell 7% to £353.8m. An uplift of 6% in overall digital revenue failed to cover the fall in print publishing income. Fox said national newspaper ad revenues were down “low single digit” – a major improvement compared with last year – thanks to heavy World Cup advertising and some of the major supermarkets returning to print advertising. “Longer term, we have seen some of the big supermarkets, like Tesco [which pulled substantial advertising spend out of newspapers] moving back into print, maybe recognising the pendulum has swung too far to social media and now it is moving back,” said Fox. The company’s share price fell 3% after the results were announced but Fox said the financial performance was “on track” and expected to be in line with market expectations. Overall, Reach reported £173.8m in charges that included £8m in restructuring, covering costs such as the job cuts following the Express takeover, and £7.5m to top its fund for settling historical phone hacking claims against its newspapers. The company said it expects to make £18m in cost savings for the full year – up from a previous target of £15m. By 2020, the company expects to have made £20m savings from the business, with £12m of that coming from editorial. Stripping out impairment charges, Reach’s adjusted operating profits rose 6.2% year-on-year to £66.5m. “We have delivered a positive financial performance in what remains a difficult trading environment for the industry, in particular the regional businesses,” said Fox. “The benefit of improved performance from national print advertising coupled with further cost mitigation will support profits over the year despite a further increase in newsprint prices for the second half.”"

          "headline": "Natural Cycles: ASA investigates marketing for contraception app",
          "bodyText": "The Advertising Standards Authority has launched a formal investigation into marketing for a Swedish app that claims to be an effective method of contraception, after reports that women have become pregnant while using it. An ASA spokesman said it had received three complaints about Natural Cycles and its paid advertising on Facebook, which describes the app as highly accurate contraception that has been clinically tested. “We would require robust substantiation from any company to support such a claim,” he said. A spokesperson for Natural Cycles confirmed the investigation, but said it related to a 2017 ad and that it had accepted the ASA’s draft recommendations. Natural Cycles is also being investigated in Sweden by the Medical Products Agency after it emerged that of 668 women who sought an abortion at a Stockholm hospital between September and December last year, 37 had been using the app for birth control. The UK statistics are unknown, but one user wrote in the Guardian that she had become pregnant and had an abortion after relying on the app to indicate the days when she could not conceive. The Family Planning Association is also concerned about the app. A spokeswoman said: “The use of the word ‘certified’ suggests that there is independent evidence supporting these claims, whereas in fact the only evidence is from the company itself. It has amassed a vast database, which is very interesting, but that is not the same as verified independent evidence. “Many other apps focus on getting to know your own body, but Natural Cycles is specifically targeting itself as a contraceptive, which is concerning.” The app’s promotion as a natural means of birth control was attractive to many women worried about taking hormones, but the association’s concern was that a generation which has come to believe there is an app for everything may be over-reliant on it without realising how motivated and disciplined users have to be to make it effective, she said. The app was developed by two scientists from Sweden and Austria: Elina Berglund, who worked at the Cern laboratory in Geneva on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and Raoul Scherwitzl. The married couple originally devised the algorithm for their own family planning, and now both work full time for the company they founded. They claim to have 600,000 users worldwide, who pay an annual subscription. Users monitor their fertility with the app by taking their temperature each morning. It tracks the results to detect ovulation, and advises which days are safe or unsafe to have unprotected sex without the risk of conception. The app relies on users taking their temperature at around the same time every morning, and cautions: “Remember that you must always measure as soon as you wake up before you snooze, sit/get up, or check your phone.” The Facebook page is full of tributes from users, and one woman has posted the launch of a petition against any possibility of the app being banned in Sweden following the Medical Product Agency’s investigation. A spokeswoman for Natural Cycles said: “We are in contact with the ASA and, since the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate on the outcome. “We can confirm however, that the ASA complaint in relation to the Facebook advertisement in question was actually raised in 2017. The advertisement which only ran for a few weeks has been taken out of circulation and we have accepted the draft recommendations very recently shared with us by the ASA.”"

          "bodyText": "Facebook The DCMS select committee’s far-reaching interim report on its 18-month investigation into fake news and the use of data and “dark ads” in elections offers a wide-ranging, informed and sustained critique that carries with it the full weight of parliament. The verdict is withering: Facebook failed. It “obfuscated”, refused to investigate how its platform was abused by the Russian government until forced by pressure from Senate committees and, in the most damning section, it aided and abetted the incitement of racial hatred in Burma, noting that even the company’s chief technical officer, Mike Schroepfer, called this “awful”. Recommendations include: • “Clear legal liability” for tech companies “to act against harmful and illegal content” with failure to act resulting in criminal proceedings. • Full auditing and scrutiny of tech companies, including their security mechanisms, and full algorithm auditing. Strengthen the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Impose a levy on tech companies operating in the UK to pay for it. The Competition and Markets Authority should investigate fake profiles and advertising fraud. • A ban on micro-targeted political advertising to similar audiences. • A “new category of tech company” to be formulated which “tightens tech companies’ liabilities and which is not necessarily either a ‘platform’ or ‘publisher’”. • Sweeping new powers for the Electoral Commission and a comprehensive overhaul of existing legislation that governs political advertisements during elections. • A further demand for Mark Zuckerberg “to come to the committee to answer questions to which Facebook has not responded adequately to date”. • A code of ethics that all tech companies will agree to uphold. Cambridge Analytica It was the Cambridge Analytica scandal that blew open the committee’s inquiry in March, though it had already been a focus of its investigations. At its hearing in Washington in February, it had asked a series of pointed questions of Simon Milner, a Facebook executive, whose answers the report describes as “disingenuous”. The report includes: • “Disturbing evidence” of work overseas that it urges the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate, including allegations it worked with Black Cube, an Israeli intelligence firm “whose work allegedly included illegal hacking”. • New allegations of an undercover sting carried out by a “temporary SCL [parent company of Cambridge Analytica] employee” who was paid £10,000 by Alexander Nix to bribe a politician in St Kitts in the Caribbean. • Details about Cambridge Analytica’s relationship with Henley &amp; Partners, a passport investment company that has programmes in St Kitts and Malta. The committee also noted that Daphne Caruana Galizia, an investigative journalist, who was murdered in October last year, was investigating the company, highlighted the damage that these passport sales were inflicting on both Malta and the European Union. The report urges the NCA to investigate SCL’s work with Henley &amp; Partners. It also notes Lord Ashcroft had recently extolled the virtues of Malta as the “best destination for ambitious UK firms” to have a post-Brexit presence in the EU. • “Really worrying” evidence that SCL also worked for the UK government, had provided psychological operation training for Ministry of Defence staff, had received classified information about Afghanistan and, according to Nix’s testimony, had “secret clearance”. The report urges the government to ensure the NCA investigates. • Concerns about “the administrator’s proposals in connection with SCL Elections Ltd, as listed in Companies House, and the fact that Emerdata Ltd is listed as the ultimate parent company of SCL Elections Ltd, and is the major creditor and owed £6.3m”. Recommends the NCA investigates. Russia DCMS committee chair Damian Collins told the Observer that when it first started asking questions about Russia, it very quickly led to questions about interference in British elections, including the EU referendum. “And we noticed an aggressive campaign against us even asking these questions. It underlined the need to persist, which we have done.” He said that the committee believed the evidence it had received so far from Facebook represented only the “tip of the iceberg”. The report includes: • A call for a full investigation into contacts between Arron Banks – millionaire backer of Leave.EU – and Russian officials and his business dealings with Russian companies. “We understand the National Crime Agency is investigating these matters. We believe that they should be given full access to any relevant information that will aid their inquiry.” • A call for a full investigation into the source of Banks’s donations to the referendum “to verify that the money was not sourced from abroad”. It notes that “should there be any doubt, the matter should be referred to the NCA”. • A proposal for limits in future elections on individual donors and for major donors to “demonstrate the source of their donations”. • A demand for further investigation by Facebook of Russian interference on its platform. Facebook’s denial of “direct Russian interference using Facebook in the Brexit referendum” was “disingenuous and typical of Facebook’s handling of our questions”. • Calls for a full ICO report on Aleksandr Kogan, the Russian-born scientist who was working in Russia with grants from the Russian government while harvesting Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica. • A request for more information about the ICO’s statement that Cambridge Analytica’s systems had been “accessed from IP addresses that resolve to Russia and other areas of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]”. • A statement from the British government on “how many investigations are currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics”. It says: “It would be wrong for Robert Mueller’s inquiry to take the lead about related issues in the UK.” It calls for coordination between all relevant authorities."

          "headline": "Algorithms may outperform doctors, but they’re no healthcare panacea",
          "bodyText": "It perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that Matt Hancock, the new health and social care secretary, made technology the theme of his first big speech in the new job. The former culture secretary is a renowned tech enthusiast and was the first MP to launch his own app. Hancock is right that technology has great potential to improve the quality of our healthcare – and save money into the bargain. But it won’t be a panacea, and it raises a number of issues our society must deal with now. Take artificial intelligence: there are already numerous examples of how it is enhancing the medical profession. Examples include robot-assisted surgery, virtual nursing assistants that could reduce unnecessary hospital visits and lessen the burden on medical professionals, and technologies that enable independent living by identifying changes in usual behaviour which need medical assistance. But AI also poses clear ethical challenges. Two examples are worth focusing on in particular: the way in which changing approaches to medical knowledge could affect the doctor-patient relationship, and the ethics of how patients’ data gets used. Until recently, patients would go to a doctor, explain their symptoms and the doctor would attempt to provide a diagnosis. But increasingly, patients now arrive having done their research online, all set to suggest (even to insist) on a diagnosis, to which the medic has to respond. Doctors tell me that this game of catch-up and partial role-reversal is already skewing the relationship of trust. In addition to this, we now have algorithm-based diagnostics. This means medical knowledge is no longer based on what the doctor themselves has studied and learned. Algorithms can support decision-making by medical professionals, and often outperform the doctor. We are seeing this with cancer detection, and other fields where close observation of the patient data can create much more precise and personalised medicine, and provide earlier diagnosis. For example, the analysis of an individual’s touch strokes on their mobile phone could show up Parkinson’s because their texting speed decreases over time. As we start to see these possibilities as fantastic rather than fantastical, we must also be aware of unintended consequences. What impact would doctors increasingly coming to rely on algorithms have on the body of medical knowledge? And how do we mitigate the risk that algorithms may not be sufficiently sensitive to everything going on in a patient’s life? For example, a patient with a high level of anxiety and stress may suffer an impact that no machine is able to capture. Algorithms will also have to be assessed to ensure they are not biased against certain groups, especially as they make decisions which may have very long-lasting consequences on individuals. There are also ethical issues around the use of patient data. This allows us to study what we haven’t yet noticed, and deal with prevention and disease management in a very different way. We will be able to identify medical conditions way before we do now by collecting a huge amount of data, including on people’s habits, and thus be able to put in place prevention mechanisms for children and family members. But patients must have a say in how their data is used. The fact that something is possible from a technical perspective does not mean we must do it. Ultimately, patients will need to decide if and to what extent they want to be observed and predicted, and how they want their personal information to be used. A tick-box exercise will not suffice, as compliance won’t be enough when it comes to confidence and trust in the machine. There are lots of challenges ahead for AI. The trickiest is getting the ethics right. Machines are machines and we must not humanise them. When we bring them in, it must be to enhance our humanity – and this can only be done if both patients and doctors are engaged to help shape the future of medicine. • Ivana Bartoletti is a privacy and data protection professional, and chairs the Fabian Women’s Network"

          "headline": "'The discourse is unhinged': how the media gets AI alarmingly wrong",
          "bodyText": "In June of last year, five researchers at Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence Research unit published an article showing how bots can simulate negotiation-like conversations. While for the most part the bots were able to maintain coherent dialogue, the researchers found that the software agents would occasionally generate strange sentences like: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.” On seeing these results, the team realized that they had failed to include a constraint that limited the bots to generating sentences within the parameters of spoken English, meaning that they developed a type of machine-English patois to communicate between themselves. These findings were considered to be fairly interesting by other experts in the field, but not totally surprising or groundbreaking. A month after this initial research was released, Fast Company published an article entitled AI Is Inventing Language Humans Can’t Understand. Should We Stop It?. The story focused almost entirely on how the bots occasionally diverged from standard English – which was not the main finding of the paper – and reported that after the researchers “realized their bots were chattering in a new language” they decided to pull the plug on the whole experiment, as if the bots were in some way out of control. Fast Company’s story went viral and spread across the internet, prompting a slew of content-hungry publications to further promote this new Frankenstein-esque narrative: “Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language,” one website reported. Not to be outdone, the Sun proposed that the incident “closely resembled the plot of The Terminator in which a robot becomes self-aware and starts waging a war on humans”. Zachary Lipton, an assistant professor at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, watched with frustration as this story transformed from “interesting-ish research” to “sensationalized crap”. According to Lipton, in recent years broader interest in topics like “machine learning” and “deep learning” has led to a deluge of this type of opportunistic journalism, which misrepresents research for the purpose of generating retweets and clicks – he calls it the “AI misinformation epidemic”. A growing number of researchers working in the field share Lipton’s frustration, and worry that the inaccurate and speculative stories about AI, like the Facebook story, will create unrealistic expectations for the field, which could ultimately threaten future progress and the responsible application of new technologies. Exaggerated claims in the press about the intelligence of computers is not unique to our time, and in fact goes back to the very origins of computing itself. In February 1946, when the school bus-sized, cumbersome Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (Eniac) was presented to the media at a press conference, journalists described it as an “electronic brain”, a “mathematical Frankenstein”, a “predictor and controller of weather” and a “wizard”. In an attempt to tamp down some of the hype around the new machine, renowned British physicist DR Hartree published an article in Nature describing how the Eniac worked in a straightforward and unsensational way. Much to his dismay, the London Times published a story that drew heavily on his research titled An Electronic Brain: Solving Abstruse Problems; Valves with a Memory. Hartree immediately responded with a letter to the editor, saying that the term “electronic brain” was misleading and that the machine was “no substitute for human thought”, but the damage was done – the Eniac was forever known by the press as the “brain machine”. It was a similar story in the United States after Frank Rosenblatt, an engineer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, presented a rudimentary machine-learning algorithm called the “perceptron” to the press in 1958. While the “perceptron” could only be trained to recognize a limited range of patterns, the New York Times published an article claiming that the algorithm was an “electronic brain” that could “teach itself”, and would one day soon “be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its own existence”. While the giddy hype around AI helped generate funding for researchers at universities and in the military, by the end of the 1960s it was becoming increasingly obvious to many AI pioneers that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of simulating the human brain in machines. In 1969, Marvin Minsky, who had pronounced only eight years earlier that machines would surpass humans in general intelligence in his lifetime, co-authored a book with Seymour Papert proving that Rosenblatt’s perceptron could not do as much the experts had once promised and was nowhere near as intelligent as the media had let on. Minsky and Papert’s book suffused the research community with a contagious doubt that spread to other fields, leading the way for an outpouring AI myth debunking. In 1972, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus published an influential screed against thinking machines called What Computers Can’t Do, and a year later the British mathematician James Lighthill produced a report on the state of machine intelligence, which concluded that “in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised”. This trough of disillusionment ushered in what has since been called the first AI winter, a period in which funding for research in the field dropped off almost entirely. The media, which had drummed up so many inflated expectations for “electronic brains”, also lost interest. While there were small resurgences in the 1980s and 1990s, AI was more or less a topic relegated to the realm of corny sci-fi novelists – computer scientists often avoided the term artificial intelligence altogether for fear of being viewed as “wild-eyed dreamers”. ••• The ice of AI’s first winter only fully retreated at the beginning of this decade after a new generation of researchers started publishing papers about successful applications of a technique called “deep learning”. While this was fundamentally a decades-old statistical technique similar to Rosenblatt’s perceptron, increases in computational power and availability of huge data sets meant that deep learning was becoming practical for tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition and language translation. As reports of deep learning’s “unreasonable effectiveness” circulated among researchers, enrollments at universities in machine-learning classes surged, corporations started to invest billions of dollars to find talent familiar with the newest techniques, and countless startups attempting to apply AI to transport or medicine or finance were founded. As this resurgence got under way, AI hype in the media resumed after a long hiatus. In 2013, John Markoff wrote a feature in the New York Times about deep learning and neural networks with the headline Brainlike Computers, Learning From Experience. Not only did the title recall the media hype of 60 years earlier, so did some of the article’s assertions about what was being made possible by the new technology. “In coming years,” Markoff wrote, “the approach will make possible a new generation of artificial intelligence systems that will perform some function that humans do with ease: see, speak, listen, navigate, manipulate and control.” Since then, far more melodramatic and overblown articles about “AI apocalypse”, “artificial brains”, “artificial superintelligence” and “creepy Facebook bot AIs” have filled the news feed daily. Lipton, a jazz saxophonist who decided to undertake a PhD in machine learning to challenge himself intellectually, says that as these hyped-up stories proliferate, so too does frustration among researchers with how their work is being reported on by journalists and writers who have a shallow understanding of the technology. What Lipton finds most troubling, though, is not technical illiteracy among journalists, but how social media has allowed self-proclaimed “AI influencers” who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk on their Medium blogs to cash in on this hype with low-quality, TED-style puff pieces. “Making real progress in AI requires a public discourse that is sober and informed,” Lipton says. “Right now, the discourse is so completely unhinged it’s impossible to tell what’s important and what’s not.” Lipton is not the first person to express concern about the new AI hype cycle and where it is taking the field. Last year, the pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote an article criticizing the “hysteria about the future of artificial intelligence” for MIT Technology Review. In 2013, New York University professor Gary Marcus wrote an article for the New Yorker in which he argued that the hype will create unrealistic expectations followed by disillusionment leading to another AI winter. But for Lipton, the problem with the current hysteria is not so much the risk of another winter, but more how it promotes stories that distract from pressing issues in the field. “People are afraid about the wrong things,” he says. “There are policymakers earnestly having meetings to discuss the rights of robots when they should be talking about discrimination in algorithmic decision making. But this issue is terrestrial and sober, so not many people take an interest.” ••• In March last year, Lipton started his own blog to try to counter-balance and deconstruct some of the most damaging sensationalist AI news. So far, he has called out a “low-quality” profile of Elon Musk in Vanity Fair and an uncritical overview of Anthony Levandowski’s so-called AI church, among others. The blog has received some attention from the media and has a regular readership, but Lipton knows that his influence is limited. “What really needs to happen is better training of journalists and more integrity,” he says. “Until that happens, my blog is just a pebble in the rapids of crap. I’m not altering the direction of the stream.” Joanne McNeil, a writer who examines emerging technologies, agrees that there is a problem with uncritical, uninquiring tech journalism, and often uses Twitter to make fun of Terminator-style articles. But at the same time, she is weary of pointing the finger solely at journalists and believes that one of the causes of AI hype is an uneven distribution of resources. “If you compare a journalist’s income to an AI researcher’s income,” she says, “it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly why it is impossible for journalists to produce the type of carefully thought through writing that researchers want done about their work.” She adds that while many researchers stand to benefit from hype, as a writer who wants to critically examine these technologies, she only suffers from it. “There are few outlets interested in publishing nuanced pieces and few editors who have the expertise to edit them,” she says. “If AI researchers really care about being covered thoughtfully and critically, they should come together and fund a publication where writers can be suitably paid for the time that it takes to really dig in.” While closer interaction between journalists and researchers would be a step in the right direction, Genevieve Bell, a professor of engineering and computer science at the Australian National University, says that stamping out hype in AI journalism is not possible. Bell explains that this is because articles about electronic brains or pernicious Facebook bots are less about technology and more about our cultural hopes and anxieties. “We’ve told stories about inanimate things coming to life for thousands of years, and these narratives influence how we interpret what is going on now,” Bell says. “Experts can be really quick to dismiss how their research makes people feel, but these utopian hopes and dystopian fears have to be part of the conversations. Hype is ultimately a cultural expression that has its own important place in the discourse.” Ultimately, Lipton agrees that there is a place for speculative writing about AI and he acknowledges how imagination and emotion can motivate inquiry in the field. “But I also think that boundary between wild speculation and real research is a little too flimsy right now,” he says. “As history shows us, this is a boundary that needs to be monitored so we can distinguish between what’s important in the here and now and what’s just fantasy.”"

          "bodyText": "An “extremely rare” leather-bound copy of Ada Lovelace’s pioneering computer program has been sold at auction for nearly £100,000. First published in 1843, the book contains Lovelace’s translation of paper from the Italian mathematician LF Menabrea discussing Charles Babbage’s plans for a computing machine. It also includes her reflections as well as explanatory notes featuring a groundbreaking algorithm, considered by some experts to be the first computer program. According to Moore Allen &amp; Innocent auction house, there are only six known bound copies of the book Lovelace had printed of the article. The Moore Allen &amp; Innocent copy of Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage Esq by LF Menabrea of Turin, Officer of the Military Engineers, with Notes by the Translator, was expected to fetch £40,000 to £60,000, but was sold for £95,000 to a Cotswolds book dealer on behalf of an anonymous buyer. The auctioneer, Philip Allwood, called it “the first separate edition of arguably the most important paper in the history of digital computing before modern times” and “an extremely rare piece”. The copy is inscribed “Lady Lovelace” on the title page, just below the printed line “with Notes by the Translator”, with additional handwritten notes attributed to Lovelace’s friend Dr William King, who is believed to have been its original owner. Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was born in 1815. She was a close friend of Babbage and was encouraged in her interest in maths by Mary Somerville and Augustus De Morgan. “She’s written a program to calculate some rather complicated numbers – Bernoulli numbers,” said Ursula Martin, co-author of a recently published biography of Ada Lovelace and a professor of computer science at Oxford University. While Babbage never built his Analytical Engine, she continued, “This shows off what complicated things the computer could have done. She sets them out in a very clear and logical way. I like to think of her as the first computer scientist. She’s also thinking about broader abstract ideas than just the first program – she’s thinking about computing as something you could build theories of, and she’s thinking about what sort of things you can compute.” Martin said a market had developed in Lovelace memorabilia, with “even a brief ‘sorry, I can’t come to tea’ letter from Lovelace rais[ing] several thousand”. She added: “Recent scholarship, seeing past the naivety and misogyny of earlier work, has recognised that [Lovelace] was an able mathematician, and that her paper went beyond the ironmongery of Babbage’s never-built invention to give far reaching insights into the nature and potential of computation.” Kate Pankhurst, a distant relative of Emmeline Pankhurst and author of the bestselling children’s book Fantastically Great Women Who Changed the World, agreed. “Until recently, her story of mathematical excellence was a lesser known one,” Pankhurst said. “So it’s a thrill to see Ada’s remarkable work drawing such attention, especially at a time when there is a huge drive to encourage more girls to turn their brilliant minds to Stem subjects and careers.” AN Devers, who is launching a rare book dealership focusing on works by or about women, The Second Shelf, in September, said the translation was “potentially worth much more than its final hammer price”, and that Lovelace had had to “gasp for acknowledgement” of her achievements. Even today, said Devers, Lovelace’s credit as the world’s first computer programmer was “often argued against by mathematicians and scholars, even though there is primary source documentation of her keen ability and training with math, her correspondence with Babbage, and her own handwritten notes of her algorithm”. Devers said The Second Shelf was “focused on the idea of women’s literary and historical contributions being under-recognised, and so even though Lovelace’s name is starting to be known, I see the road she must travel in her afterlife to be long and arduous and in need of support from historians and mathematicians who will not undermine her genius.”"

          "bodyText": "I am not a communist. Literally. Though God knows I have been called one for demanding a tea break when working in Florida. I half-pretended to be one when I worked for Marxism Today, the magazine of the Communist party of Great Britain, but I never joined. Which was lucky really, because when the business manager forgot to pay the electricity bills and everyone got sent home, they didn’t get paid as they were in the party, but I did. But I loved it when the activist Ash Sarkar yelled at that puffer fish who presents Good Morning Britain: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.” Sarkar is a great thing, as is fun communism. Where can I sign up? In the past, you see, I have had issues with communism. Cults, authority, centralisation – never mind gulags, secret police, rape, the imprisonment of intellectuals and mass killlings. There are two sorts of folk: those who want a programme of what to do and those of us who are incapable of following instructions, whether they come from Ikea or the cadre of Corbyn. We just don’t have it in us. We want a revolution we can dance to, not an allen key of self-righteousness. I love Marx. Unlike most of his acolytes he could write; his words vibrate on the page. Just when you think you know about how the world is swirling, he says: “If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.” In the words of Bob Dylan: “Don’t follow leaders/watch the parking meters.” All kinds of unlikely people have declared themselves communists. When I worked at Marxism Today, posh old ladies would come in to dust the bust of Lenin in the basement. At that point, we all loved Gramsci and Red Bologna, where the Italian Communist party held power: the fun kind of communism, not the “tankie” Stalinist kind. Bologna struggled, as theorist Franco Berardi told us, because workers were pitted against what he called “precarious, underpaid young proletarians”. Ring any bells? They did not believe that any party could lead to communism. They wanted to rebuild society with no limitations; they were the Autonomia activists. This idea of cities breathing fire, of socialism in one country: all this was exciting, and like today’s young self-declared communists who fetishise automation as the ultimate liberation. “It’s about the desire to see the coercive structures of state dismantled, while also having fun,” says Sarkar. But the glossing-over of what communism is, of who it killed, and seeing that as a moral equivalence with the deaths caused by capitalism, is idiotic ahistoricism. The idea of talking about communism with no centralised state is just that: an idea. The refusal of parts of the left to criticise Putin, or see the misery of Cuban peasants, Chinese workers, or those starving in Venezuela is sickening. The really great stuff being discussed by young leftists is not communism, it is anarcho-syndicalism – participatory local democracy. Corbyn is an unlikely step on the way to these localised utopias. For if there is any group of people that doesn’t allow freethinking, it is some of his followers, who see any microaggression against the great leader as punishable by death. Or worse if you are on Twitter. If you want to be a proper communist you need to understand ideology, and this is currently a big failing. Your case has to connect to freedom. Still the right lays claim to this. Freedom for the many, not the few, yes … but each of us has also to be free. When communism connotes liberty, I will sign up. But as long as it is associated only with obedience, I literally won’t be buying the T-shirt.This fun kind of communism is a lovely commodity indeed. All I see is people saying: “Get with the project or you are persona non grata.” Same as it ever was. Comrades: at least read your own history. Pottery for sanity is all very well. But show me the money The mass overprescribing of antidepressants (one-in-six adults in England used them last year) is hardly news. It has a number of causes: cuts to GP services; minimal mental health provision; severely limited access to any kind of talking therapy beyond CBT and epidemics of depression and anxiety. You can be prescribed antidepressants by hurried doctors for anything from acute and extremely worrying symptoms to exam anxiety or menopausal insomnia. The new health secretary, Matt Hancock, want new cures. Of course he does. He wants GPs to prescribe social activities: arts clubs, gardening, pottery. All these things are good. Everyone knows exercise and company is good. Part of being depressed, though, is often not being able to do what we know is good for us. “Social prescribing”, or setting up patients with these activities, is not a bad idea, but his offer of £4.5m for these schemes is chicken feed. It’s less than the cost of Boris Johnson’s second home. We have a severe mental health crisis in the UK, and severely rundown mental health provision. Every day, I see very ill people walking around or sleeping on the streets. Every day, I hear of extremely ill teenagers with self-harm problems, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts; adults who are addicts and extremely lonely. We can argue over what is causing this degree of suffering; the fact is, it is there in front of our eyes. The medications work for some, and not for others. So we urgently need to fund the alternatives properly and seriously, instead of endlessly talking about mental health issues in a more “open” way but stripping all services to the bone. This is the real crisis of the NHS. This new health secretary has to put more money where his mouth is. How I maintain my strong anti-work ethic I am apped out. Sorry, but most of them are bossy little widgets that I can totally live without. The news that scientists have developed an algorithm to work out the perfect amount of caffeine you need to perk up leaves me as cold as a frappe. Surely I can decide this for myself? No – it is apparently 200mg or something and they are working on an app to tell you this. “If you could come to work, drink caffeine and have your mental acuity improved by 40% for four hours, wouldn’t you like that?” No – quite honestly, I wouldn’t."

          "bodyText": "When I was in my mid-20s, fresh out of graduate school, I worked as an office temp in New York. It was like being invisible for my whole working day. Everywhere I worked, people called me Christina or Elizabeth or Stephanie – any girl’s name. No one cared that I was a writer. No one ever even asked me to lunch. I ate alone every day. I had just been through a bad breakup, and many of my friends had moved away, so often I ate dinner alone, too. I began spending more time at the bar across the street from my apartment building. The bar was called Toby’s and it was dim and rectangular, with time-darkened floors and a scary red-painted bathroom. Students went there as well as locals, and the bartenders were friendly, so there was always someone I knew. I told myself that I was using the bar as a sort of community centre – a meeting place for civic-minded neighbours. I went there to gather with local townspeople for political and public awareness; Toby’s was a rich component of urban community life; alcohol was not the point at all. I wasn’t a regular. (I was totally a regular.) I wasn’t the only one. Others included a man who looked absurdly like Barney Rubble. An estate agent named Lina. A man in a leather jacket, who ended all conversations by saying, “Shoulda, woulda, coulda.” A younger man with long flowing hair and combat boots. A thin, intense young woman who wrote poetry. The bartender’s girlfriend was there every night, doing crossword puzzles. I had the distinct impression that she didn’t dare let the bartender out of her sight. And there was an exceedingly creepy regular named Willie. Willie worked around Toby’s – washing glasses, restocking supplies – as a way to keep up with his bar tab, which must have been astronomical. He was short, with greasy grey hair and a bloated face and teeth like dirty kernels of corn. His eyes were the worst – glittery and vulturine. He always found an excuse to walk behind any girl who stood at the jukebox, or brush up against any girl who used the payphone, or squeeze past any girl who stood in line for the bathroom. The poet and I would occasionally have irony-free conversations about how we never seemed to have time to write, but the others seemed to tolerate me, if not especially like me. During my lunch hour at temp jobs, I began making calls about volunteer work. I applied to Samaritans and was accepted. For two weekends, I went to volunteer training sessions, which I loved, because I liked being a student again and I was intrigued by some of the emotional stories. As part of the training, all volunteers were asked to attend a local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting so we could see what it was like to seek help, as well as to give it. I found a meeting in the basement of a church in my neighbourhood and, when I walked in, lots of people recognised me and waved hello. (Maybe I was spending too much time at Toby’s.) I ended up having a good time – more studying, more stories, plus they served free doughnuts. I completed my training and started working at Samaritans. Ironically, the call centre was grim, dingy and depressing. Chipped lime-green walls, two battle-scarred desks and squeaky roller chairs. It wasn’t all that different from Toby’s, actually, although it lacked a jukebox. It is daunting, even frightening, to answer calls at a suicide prevention line, but you get used to it quickly. Samaritans taught the volunteers an algorithm to use on callers, so I always had an idea of what to say. They also taught us never to use the word “I” in a sentence when talking to a caller, and that helped me focus. And besides, most of the calls are from repeat customers and they know how to put you at ease. Because, like Toby’s, Samaritans had regulars – so many that there was a whole three-ring binder with notes on them called the Regulars Book. New volunteers were supposed to read through the binder and familiarise themselves with the regulars, so that, for instance, you didn’t spend two hours talking to Crystal about her feelings of worthlessness only to have her say at the end, “Well, I guess I’ll give you a call again next week when my husband goes bowling.” We were supposed to work the assessment algorithm with the regulars. It was supposed to go like this: Are you thinking of suicide? No. Have you thought about suicide in the past two months? No. Have you ever attempted to kill yourself? No. Oh, well, thanks, goodbye. Click. But it didn’t really work like that because the regulars had got wise to it and, if they felt like talking, they answered yes to one of the questions and that prompted you to ask more. Do you have a plan? Do you have access to pills or weapons? And then the regular would say yes to one of those questions and it would prompt other questions and the call might go on pointlessly for half an hour when, really, all the regular wanted was a little sympathy about how overpriced cantaloupe is. I got to know them all: Frank with his disabling shyness, and Calvin, whose chronic bronchitis kept him housebound, and Eva, whose children never called, and Ricardo with his addiction to couponing, and Roberta with her crippling fear of laundromats, and Mark with his ailing mother. They weren’t suicidal, most of them – they were unbearably lonely. Their loneliness was so palpable it flowed down the lines toward me, as thick and sticky as old motor oil. I did my best with all of them, tried to do whatever good I could in a 10-minute call. I knew that, often, I was the only person they would speak to that day. It seemed to be enough just to say, “Did something happen today?” or, “That sounds truly upsetting.” The only regular I disliked talking to was a girl named Rosie, who called sometimes to talk about how her writing career had stalled. “And I’m a fucking excellent writer!” she’d say. I worried that Rosie and I had too much in common. Some regulars called pretty much every day, as a sort of check-in: “Not too badly, thanks, though they were clean sold out of coleslaw at the deli.” Some called weekly: “Well, just thought I’d let you know I’m still upright.” Sometimes the regulars disappeared for months or even years. No one knew what had happened to them during these hiatuses, but I always wondered. Did the regular get more functional and actually go out in the world and live life for a while? Or did they get less functional and spend time in a hospital, perhaps one where phones were not allowed? Or did they take up with some other, more desirable hotline and only return to Samaritans when the new hotline stopped taking their calls? In nearly all respects, the regulars mirrored my romantic life up to that point. There was a chalkboard where volunteers left notes for the incoming shift about regulars. “Maude’s been watching the Weather Channel again.” (Maude had a fear of storms.) “Abe’s mother is in the hospital.” “Bob says Meals on Wheels didn’t show.” And, once, excitingly, “Dena is sending us eclairs!” Dena was like a Facebook ranter 20 years before Facebook even existed. She called almost every day to say something like, “People used to have manners!” and, “Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I believe in hard work!” and, “I guess any idiot can get a medical licence.” And now she was sending us eclairs – unexpected but very much appreciated. The eclairs arrived the next week, in a white box with a green ribbon. Some volunteers refused to eat them – they thought Dena might be trying to poison us – but I thought they were delicious, all the more so as they got slightly stale. A local TV station wanted to do a story on Samaritans and the administrator asked me if I would be willing to appear on the segment. I found this wildly flattering, even though it was just going to be the back of my head that appeared: Samaritans wanted to maintain the anonymity of its volunteers. I showed up for the televised shift and sat at the desk while the camera crew set up and wired me for sound. As soon as they were ready, the lines went silent. We waited. And waited. Finally the phone rang and I answered immediately, using what I hoped was a soothing, professional tone, “Samaritans, can I help you?” “Oh, hello,” said a woman with a matter-of-fact voice. “My husband is set to work the next shift at Samaritans and he’s gone off and left his lunch here on the table.” “And how do you feel about that?” I asked, acutely conscious of the camera. “I don’t feel any particular way about it,” the woman said. “But do you all have some crackers and peanut butter to tide him over? I tried to call him at the office but he’d already left.” “Yes, we do,” I said, and then, for the cameras, I added, “It may be hard to believe it now, but you won’t always feel this way.” This was one of the all-purpose remarks they taught us in training. “Probably not,” the woman agreed cheerfully. “Thanks a lot!” She hung up. I turned around. The camera crew was already packing up. “You did a great job,” the producer told me. The segment aired on the evening news the next night. The cameraman had caught me in profile and I was immediately extremely recognisable. The next time I walked into Toby’s, all the regulars cheered. People bought me drinks for a week. Now the Toby’s regulars began to think of me as a good listener. Lina told me about her daughter’s sciatica and helped me find an apartment. The leather-jacketed man asked my advice on his music career and gave me the number of a good locksmith. The bartender’s girlfriend let me help her with the crosswords and even smiled when she saw me. She was pretty when she smiled. Barney Rubble turned out to be a homicide detective and helped me with the plot of a short story. (No one at Samaritans had ever helped me with the plot of a story, but then no one from Toby’s had ever sent me eclairs.) The poet got a job in midtown and now I had someone to meet for lunch. I realised, belatedly, that the Toby’s regulars were just as lonely as the Samaritans regulars. And – even more belatedly – I realised that I had been lonely, too. Now I belonged. One night Willie followed a pretty student out of Toby’s and kissed her as she drunkenly waited for a cab. The bartender opened the door and whistled sharply. “Willie, knock it off!” The girl extricated herself and a taxi pulled up to take her home, but I couldn’t get over it. “That poor girl!” I kept saying to the bartender. “She’ll never be the same!” He was more philosophical. “She’ll be all right.” “But Willie kissed her!” “Here’s what’ll happen,” the bartender said. “She’ll cut back on her drinking for a while, she’ll defrost her freezer, she’ll call her mother more often than she used to. In no time at all, she’ll be fine.” It wasn’t quite what we said at Samaritans, but it wasn’t that different. And it did make me feel better. Samaritans had a Christmas party at a bar – for the volunteers, not the callers – and I met lots of new people. Most importantly, I met the man who is now my husband. I was sitting at a table with three beers lined up in front of me because I disliked queueing, and I guess he thought that showed practicality, or industriousness, or maybe just forward thinking. He came over to talk to me. A year later, we moved to London, and I said goodbye to my temp agency – “Goodbye, Josephine!” they said – and the regulars at Toby’s. I couldn’t say goodbye to the regulars at Samaritans because we weren’t allowed to give out personal information, but I wanted to. I still think of them. Sometimes I want to talk to them. I wonder what Ricardo thinks of Groupon and if Frank has discovered match.com and whether Dena is on Facebook now. But mostly, I wish I could tell them again what I learned for myself: you may not believe it, but you won’t always feel this way.

          "bodyText": "Last summer I had an abortion. Statistically unremarkable, yes, but mine wasn’t because of a split condom or a missed pill. I was four months into a tense relationship with a much-hyped Swedish “digital contraceptive”, a smartphone app called Natural Cycles. I had spent my 20s on the pill, but hated not knowing whether my emotional state was down to artificial hormones or not. My boyfriend and I had been together for eight months, and I was desperately seeking something new, something that wouldn’t make me feel so anxious. That’s when the adverts started following me around on social media: glowing women reclining in Scandi bedrooms, all pale grey sheets and dappled light, brandishing basal thermometers and telling me how great it felt to “get to know yourself better”. Natural Cycles’ ads promised the “world’s first contraceptive app”, something “natural, hormone free &amp; non-invasive”. I could start using it without a two-week wait for a doctor’s appointment and so, in a fug of hormones and frustration, I bought a subscription. I was sold on shiny promises, a sleek user interface and the fact that a former Cern physicist, Elina Berglund, was at the company’s helm. But four months in, it failed. Berglund helped discover the Higgs boson; but it turns out her algorithm couldn’t map my menstrual cycle. Femtech, or female health technology, is going through a boom phase, with an estimated $1bn of investment raised worldwide in the last three years. Apps such as Clue, Dot, Glow and Spot On are all popular period trackers, but Natural Cycles is the only one certified as contraception. In 2017, it was approved for use across the EU, getting the green light from the German inspection and certification organisation, Tüv Süd. How does it work? It comprises an app, an annual subscription of about £60, and a thermometer accurate to two decimal points (free in the post). You input your temperature as soon as you wake up, and the app makes predictions about your fertility each day: green for “go have unprotected sex”, red for “not unless you want a baby” (you can also use the app to plan a pregnancy). No hormones, no implant and, supposedly, no stress. It has its own language: users are known as “Cyclers”, and useful information is available via a “Cyclerpedia”. It seems as easy as ordering a takeaway or a taxi from your phone; of course there’s an app for fertility, too. Natural Cycles has now registered more than 700,000 users from more than 200 countries, 125,000 of them in the UK. But its certification as contraception is under review in Sweden, where the company and its married co-founders are based. In January, a major Swedish hospital reported that 37 of the 668 women who had sought an abortion there between September and December 2017 were using Natural Cycles as their sole birth control, and the Medical Products Agency of Sweden began to investigate [*See Update below]. Natural Cycles has responded that the number of pregnancies is proportional to the registered number of Swedish users and “in line with our expectations”; but as someone who didn’t report my own pregnancy last year, keeping it secret even from my parents, I wonder how many more there have been. It wasn’t the stigma that kept me quiet, or the sadness, though that trailed me all summer like the sinister melody of an ice-cream van. It wasn’t the fact that being 28, in a stable-seeming relationship and game for motherhood in a couple of years, I lacked an explanation other than precarious finances and a relationship just shy of its first anniversary (those are excellent reasons). No, my silence was because I felt colossally naive. I’d used the app in the way I do most of the technology in my life: not quite knowing how it works, but taking for granted that it does. Speaking to others who bought the app as contraception (about 75% of Natural Cycles’ total user base, according to its CEO), it seems that many feel the same. I spoke to Amy, 29, who was fed up with hormones when she started using the app as her sole birth control. Three months later, she was pregnant, a “massive shock”. Though she admits she may have made a mistake, she can’t pinpoint the error. “You’re told all you need to know is yourself. I believed in it the same way I did the pill and thought I did everything right.” Having already booked her wedding, she went ahead with the pregnancy, giving birth weeks before she walked down the aisle. “It’s supposed to make you feel like you have more control, but in fact it did the opposite: when I fell pregnant it felt like a decision was taken out of our hands. It wasn’t how we’d have planned it, and I don’t recommend weddings two weeks postpartum, but I’m lucky it was something we wanted in the long run.” Marie, 30, first heard about the app when she saw an Instagram post about it (search for Natural Cycles and you will find hundreds of posts by influencers telling you how it changed their lives). “I didn’t spot the hashtag at the very end of the caption which said that it was a sponsored post,” she says. She had been taking Yasmin, a commonly prescribed contraceptive pill, for six years when she made the switch, hoping that the app would be a reliable and easy alternative. A year into a relationship, and eight months into using Natural Cycles, Marie realised she was pregnant. She had an abortion that proved traumatic, contributing to the breakdown of the relationship and leading her into what she describes as “a pit of despair”. She didn’t want to tell anyone about it. She’d had an abortion once before, when a morning-after pill didn’t work, but this time she felt ashamed: “I felt like I’d acted alone in the decision to use the app and had been overly trusting. But I was also angry that I’d been treated like a consumer, not a patient.” Like Marie, I didn’t go to my GP before I switched to the app, probably because I subconsciously knew he’d advise against it. In many ways he knows me better than any algorithm can. He put me on the pill at 18 because I had an irregular cycle. I later learned I had polycystic ovary syndrome, which I now know makes me a terrible candidate for Natural Cycles, because my ovulation is unpredictable and erratic. A year earlier, before I’d heard of the app, I had been to see a gynaecologist to discuss birth control, thinking I wanted a non-hormonal coil fitted. It was the first time a medical professional had helped me to truly understand the extent of my options. She drew me a set of coordinates and plotted each option available (no app got a mention) to show me the benefits and drawbacks. Spotting v cramps, depression v maintenance, long- v short-term. I’d read grim things about the hormonal vaginal ring – a widely shared article about a young, fit woman who died after a blood clot – but agreed, based on what she felt would suit me best, to try it. We laughed at how it’s impossible to research any birth control online without encountering horror stories. I told myself I would trust a professional and cease my Googling as it only induced anxiety; but after a few paranoid weeks wearing compression socks to avoid blood clots, I was done. None of the posts on my social-media feed suggested that being a “Cycler” would be such a frustrating, often daunting commitment. One paid-for post I saw featured a still life of a puppy, a pair of on-trend headphones, a self-help book and a thermometer, with a 250-word caption starting with “5 things I need in the morning. Cuddles from Bee [the dog], tea, music, positive quotes and the first thing I do when I wake up – my Natural Cycles thermometer.” But I found that taking your temperature regularly is not so easy. The number of times I leapt out of bed bleary-eyed and needing to pee, then realised I hadn’t first taken my temperature, meant I started waking up in the middle of the night to pre-emptively urinate, panicked about missing my measuring window in the morning. On the pill, it didn’t matter if I’d just woken up, was lying down or standing up when I took it. With Natural Cycles, the slightest motion seemed to count. It was comedic until it became tragic; I got pregnant when the predictions of fertile and infertile changed back and forth in one day, turning from green to red, after I had unprotected sex. I now know that the ideal Cycler is a narrow, rather old-fashioned category of person. She’s in a stable relationship with a stable lifestyle. (Shift-workers, world-travellers, the sickly, the stressed, insomniacs and sluts be advised.) She’s about 29, and rarely experiences fevers or hangovers. She is savvy about fertility and committed to the effort required to track hers. I could add that her phone is never lost or broken and she’s never late to work. She wakes up at the same time every day, with a charged phone and a thermometer within reach. “From the information provided by Natural Cycles, I expected that my body temperature would follow a clear pattern and that I would be able to pinpoint five days in every four-week cycle that I was fertile,” says Lucy, 32. She switched from the pill after becoming concerned about an increased risk of breast cancer, after one of her friends was diagnosed. “I did feel like I was getting to understand my body better, but soon realised that I can’t pinpoint when I wake up each day. Some mornings I stir at 5am, roll over and try to sleep for another hour or two, sometimes I toss and turn from 2am to 6am and then fall asleep, and so on.” Her readings were erratic. “I couldn’t see a pattern and this undermined my confidence. After using Natural Cycles for three full cycles, I found I was still having eight to 10 red [ie possibly fertile] days per cycle.” After four months, she decided it was no better than using a calendar and went back on the pill. No form of contraception is 100% effective; most are assessed according to two metrics: typical use and perfect use. “Typical” reflects a margin for human error; “perfect” is when it’s used absolutely correctly. With perfect use, Natural Cycles scores as 99% effective, with just 1% of women becoming pregnant. With regular use, according to clinical studies carried out by the company (self-selecting, rather than randomised control trials), that drops to 93%. This is often cited by the company as favourable compared with the pill (91% effective with “regular use”). But, unlike the pill, you’re not covered for every day of the month. You have to abstain or use other contraception on fertile days. And in the first few months, as the app “gets to know you”, these are pretty near continuous. When I talk to Raoul Scherwitzl, the CEO and co-founder of Natural Cycles, he is charming and sincere and calls at precisely the appointed hour, not a second early or late. “My wife and I represent a typical user-couple,” he says. “Elina was on hormonal birth control for 10 years and we knew we wanted children, but in a couple of years. We both had PhDs in physics and [Elina was] working at Cern, dealing with messy, fluctuating data, trying to look for the Higgs boson, which is basically looking for a signal amid noise. We started applying the same statistical methods to pinpoint my wife’s ovulation amid her varying temperatures. We read up on the literature and developed an algorithm which our colleagues started using, too. We were running it on the Cern servers and then using Google spreadsheets. We saw it as an unmet need. There was a lack of choice and we wanted to innovate in an important field.” I tell Scherwitzl that, though the need is real, after purchasing the app, caveat after caveat revealed itself. I didn’t know it would take months to become reliable. “The algorithm is cautious by design,” he explains. “It gives red days unless it’s sure.” I tell him how I got pregnant, when the predictions changed after I’d had sex. Scherwitzl empathises (“I am sorry to hear that”) but says that as well as “downsides”, there is “a huge upside with all the happy users” and that “the most important thing is to use protection on red days: it relies on that”.Has the company adapted its communication strategy to reflect the experience of users who have become pregnant? “At the core, our messaging has always been grounded on facts but we do evolve what we say. We used to state the 93% figure but without the right context, so there were certain expectations on the product.” The 93% figure comes from existing users responding to the company’s calls for participants, research that has been criticised by a reproductive health expert as “inappropriate and misleading”, and more like “marketing research” than a medical study. But Scherwitzl insists the data is robust, and preferable to a medicalised control test. “There are pros and cons to that type of study, and in our view this reflects the world better.” What about the targeted advertising? Isn’t it strange to get social-media influencers (one prominent Swedish blogger is now an investor) to promote a medical product? He doesn’t think so. “Social media allows us to control the narrative because there’s lots of misinformation out there, not just with us but with every type of birth control. We can also target the right age group.” The investigation by Sweden’s medical watchdog is now six months in, and has started its second phase, reviewing marketing material, past clinical studies and fresh user data. Reports of unwanted pregnancies have not, however, had any negative effect on the business. In a 2016 interview I wish I’d read, Scherwitzl’s wife and business partner Elina Berglund described her ideal user as a woman who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception before trying. Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockhom was part of a team of researchers hired by Berglund pointed out that it’s not a good option for women who want to entirely avoid a pregnancy, she said. But somehow this message has got lost in Natural Cycles’ marketing; this is very much not what the word “contraception” means to me. Indeed, on the section of the Natural Cycles website aimed at medical professionals there is a “decision tree” for doctors considering prescribing the app as birth control. Is the patient over 18? Is she satisfied with her current birth control? If the answers to those questions are yes and no, then the third is: would she be “devastated” to get pregnant within the next year? If the answer is yes, the doctor is told not to prescribe the app. Perhaps those questions should be compulsory when you click through on a Natural Cycle link. Instead, the app assumes the intimate voice of a trusted doctor, mixed with the sort of gamified messaging you find on other apps. You might get an update saying, “Nice curves! You have a nice and smooth temperature curve with small day-to-day variations. Keep up the good work!” The company’s social media is peppered with hashtags such as #yourcyclematters and #wakeupmeasuregetup. The perkiness is grating – even the thermometer bears the slogan “Good morning!” – and can be pressurising, too. One woman I spoke to who bought Natural Cycles to try to plan a pregnancy told the company she wanted to leave after six months, as the daily tracking was too stressful. She emailed to ask for a break, “for emotional wellbeing”. A customer service manager responded to say she could cancel, and reactivate when she wanted, but that “I took a quick look at your data, and in terms of ovulation everything looks good!”, adding, “You do not need to worry about losing any data – we never delete anything!” Those exclamation marks don’t make such reassurances any less creepy. Perhaps this false sense of intimacy is why it felt more like a betrayal to find myself pregnant than if the pill were at fault. After the abortion, the honeymoon period of my relationship ended abruptly. It felt like we’d begun our romantic race with a false start. I stopped using the thermometer and went back on the pill, but it took me a while longer to part ways with the app. I deleted it from my phone, only to realise the direct debit was rolling and non-refundable. I have just been sent another £60 bill, for a contraceptive app I no longer use, that got me pregnant. But it’s not just the money that bothers me – it’s the reminder that I put so much faith in a technology that in the end relied on something as unreliable as my body. What’s the hashtag for that? • This article was amended on 28 November 2019 because an earlier version misattributed to Berglund a statement that should have been attributed to Kristina Gemzell Danielsson. It was further amended on 6 December 2019 to make it clear that only Berglund worked at CERN, not her husband. • Update added 19 December 2019: The Swedish Medical Products Agency completed its review in September 2018 concluding that the pregnancies were in fact in line with the product’s failure rate, but asked the company to “clarify the risk of unwanted pregnancies” in the instructions and app, which the company did. • If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."

          "bodyText": "I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 14. This means my pancreas no longer naturally produces insulin; and without insulin, my blood glucose levels will go dangerously high. The biggest impact was on my sleep. I used to love lying in on weekends. After I was diagnosed in 2002, I had to set my alarm for 7am to take my insulin and eat something, then continue testing my blood sugar and inject myself several times a day. This process became a little easier when I got an insulin pump, and later a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The pump continuously infuses insulin into my body, and the CGM sensor can report my blood sugar every five minutes. At night, I relied on the CGM’s built-in alarm to wake me if my glucose passed the threshold that required immediate action; but though I tried several CGMs, the alarms were never loud enough, and they couldn’t be turned up or changed. I talked to manufacturers, but nothing improved. Once I went to college and lived alone, this became a bigger problem; I was increasingly afraid of going to sleep at night. The alarms on my phone woke me, though, and it occurred to me that if I could send the data from my device to my phone, I could solve the problem myself. I came across someone on Twitter who had managed to reverse-engineer the software on his young son’s CGM, so he could monitor his son’s blood sugar remotely. He shared his code with me, which was a big breakthrough. With help from my then boyfriend and now husband, Scott, who is a computer networking engineer, I was able to send CGM data to my phone via a laptop. (My own background is in communications and public relations.) We created an alarm that would rouse me if my blood glucose levels were too low or too high. From there, it was a small step to build a webpage so I could add a “snooze button” to press after taking action. This allowed me to create a remote monitoring system so that if I still slept through an alarm, Scott would be alerted and call me or drive over. Scott and I also created an algorithm that forecasted when my blood sugar was likely to become low or too high, sending alerts to my phone or smartwatch. I was happier and no longer feared going to sleep, but this was still an “open loop” system: it was up to me to take any needed action. A few months later, working with others in the open-source diabetes community, we realised that by adding a small computer and a radio stick to the pump and CGM, we could create a system that not only processed the data, but also sent commands directly to the pump. That’s how we created what is in effect an artificial pancreas, or a “closed loop” system. The first day I woke up after closing the loop, I was blown away by how much better I felt. I decided I was never going to leave home (Scott and I live in Seattle) without it. The equipment can fit in a bag or a pocket. We designed it for safety: if something breaks or I lose it, I can go back to using my insulin pump manually. Endocrinologists have been interested in our developments, and for me, having a computer make adjustments while I sleep is far safer than trying groggily to make decisions overnight. The system also makes small adjustments every five minutes, rather than large adjustments infrequently, as humans do. Having created something that changed and improved my own life, and having benefited from others’ open-source work, I wanted to share our work so other people could use it. This is why we created OpenAPS – the Open Artificial Pancreas System project: to make the code, design and documentation available to others for free, so they can build a “pancreas” of their own. More than 725 people worldwide have now built various types of DIY closed-loop systems, and the growing community has continued to improve the code and the systems. Many of us have no medical or engineering training and we work on improvements in the evening or at the weekend, for free. Commercial devices similar to ours are now being trialled and gradually coming on to the market: we’re happy to be helping companies to speed up development. The most important thing is that people don’t have to wait. The fact that others now have the freedom to make that choice is something I’m very proud of. • As told to Chris Broughton Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "Until last week, there were three Blockbuster stores left in the United States; after its two Alaskan branches shut up shop, there is now just one, in Bend, Oregon. It’s an independently owned franchise, so escaped the mass shuttering of its siblings that occurred between 2012 and 2014. The general manager, Sandi Harding, told the New York Times that there were no plans to shut it down in the near future. “We still have that core group of customers that know we’re local, are very loyal and come in every week. Everyone’s tired of sitting at home on their phones and their laptops and not having any personal interactions.” As a freelance writer, I am familiar with sitting at home on my phone and my laptop not having any personal interactions, but one of the positives of that state is having thousands of films at my fingertips to help pass the down time. (If you have never watched A Bad Moms Christmas at 10am on a Tuesday, then congratulations on your proper job.) The notion of having to travel to a physical shop to rent a DVD or VHS is a distant memory for many, and a completely unfamiliar concept for some. This is an age of convenience and entertainment is on tap. Unless it’s essential that it should be seen on the big screen – as I learned from watching Avatar on a plane – we no longer need to leave the house to bring a film into it. For the most part, rentals have been replaced by subscriptions, and I wonder how many film buffs would truly, honestly sacrifice this convenience for the nostalgia of a Friday night visit to the video shop. Part of the reason that people hold the memory of video shops so close is because there was no alternative way of seeing films before the internet really kicked in. It’s hard to overplay the importance of having that library of films at a time before it was so easy to see everything. As a young person in the 90s and 00s experiencing murmurings about my sexuality, it was a way of seeing films that made all of that seem far less daunting: But I’m a Cheerleader, in particular, acted as a kind of comfort blanket. I remember getting Kissing Jessica Stein out, and telling my mum it was about dating in New York. “I know what it’s about,” she said, and kindly left it at that. Now, of course, there’s no need to brave taking that tape up to the counter, but then, it was a lifeline. It’s incredibly easy to reach for a misty-eyed, Stranger Things version of the video shops, then, but they did have their downsides. There were the late fees (folklore has it that Reed Hastings started Netflix after he was stung with a $40 fine for failing to return a VHS copy of Apollo 13), the wait for your turn to take out that shop’s one copy of that year’s big blockbuster must-see release, and, for introverts, the fact that you had to talk to people at all, instead of just quietly clicking on “Critically acclaimed dramas with a strong female lead” category. For a vivid reminder of your worst nightmare video shop assistant, watch the first season of Dawson’s Creek, and hold your streaming subscription tight. For all of the thwarted Dawson Leerys out there, though, an algorithm really is no match for a human recommendation – I still have some of the promotional posters that the independent video shop in my home town saved for me. (That is, before a chain arrived, and hastened its demise.) Harding might well be right that despite our seeming connectedness, we crave the kind of community that a shop and its staff can offer, particularly when it comes to personal insight and accuracy. While Netflix, for example, throws every “strong female lead in Hollywood” my direction, it also thinks I might want to watch Horrid Henry Flicks the Bogey again, after I once left my account logged in for my nephew. For film fans, there are sites that combine convenience and curation, particularly when they focus on a niche. Take Mubi, which describes itself as an “online cinematheque” and collects its content by director and by theme, picking a film of the day, providing buff-friendly information around it. It’s no conversation, but it’s an approximation of it. When we mythologise video shops, perhaps we’re really acknowledging that mass convenience turns the special into the mundane. There was a particular sense of ceremony to the weekly video shop trip, at least in my family. It made movie-watching a treat to be savoured. In much the same way as Spotify’s playlists have turned the experience of listening to music into a scroll through office-friendly playlists of no discernible personality, there is something routine now about choosing which film to watch. It has become a casual weeknight endeavour, rather than a joyful splurge for the end of the week. • Rebecca Nicholson is a freelance writer"

          "bodyText": "With Wall Street lifted by financial stocks after Morgan Stanley’s results, offsetting a dip in technology shares in the wake of the Google fine, European markets have ended the day in positive territory. In the UK, the FTSE 100 benefitted from a drop in the pound following the unexpectedly static inflation figures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 49.95 points or 0.65% at 7676.28 Germany’s Dax added 0.82% to 12,765.94 France’s Cac closed 0.46% higher at 5447.44 Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.03% to 21,972.22 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 9753.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 74 points or 0.3%. Google owner Alphabet is up 0.44% despite the news of the European Commission’s €4.34bn fine. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his second day of testimony to Congress, including a discussion on the current trade situation following President Trump’s tariffs. Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. “If this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,” Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. “It isn’t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.” Powell’s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration’s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime “it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.” At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump’s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was “holding up” a deal to resolve a “significant trade dispute” between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a “significant” trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday’s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed’s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is “a bit misguided” but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company’s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon’s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn’t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC’s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google’s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers “the option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps”. The EC, though, accuses Google of using “tying practices” and “exclusivity payments” to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That’s at the heart of today’s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps—or browsers, or search engines—to the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s—the dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission’s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here’s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC’s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a ‘excellent decision’, adding: “No-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.” US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe’s new data privacy rules (even though this isn’t a data violation). Here’s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today’s press conference: Our news story about Google’s record fine for breaking Europe’s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record €4.34bn (£3.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google’s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system “to cement its dominance as a search engine”, preventing rivals from innovating and competing “and this is illegal under EU antitrust rules”. Vestager added: “The vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don’t download competing apps. “Or to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said ‘there ain’t no such thing as a free search.’” Here’s Jennifer’s story: Today’s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here’s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It’s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google’s services. “The EU’s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,” said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. “Android has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today’s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump’s attacks on the EU’s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it’s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn’t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but “it wasn’t possible because of Google’s illegal restrictions”. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it’s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn’t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a ‘silver bullet’ to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that “Your tax lady really hates the US”? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It’s true that she’s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president’s claim becomes less accurate. “I very much like the US”, Vestager insists, pointing out that she’s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today’s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google’s “very serious illegal behaviour”, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn’t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to ‘due process’, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical ‘cease and desist’ decision. It’s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won’t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines “never really” got a foothold on Android, due to Google’s restrictions (ie, the company didn’t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren’t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week’s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn’t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google’s fine reflects the “seriousness” and sustained natures of its violation of the EC’s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its ‘illegal conduct’ within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn’t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC’s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission’s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today’s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google’s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival ‘forks’ of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google’s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn’t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google €4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC’s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union’s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the €2.4bn (£2.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some €11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around €4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain’s retail sector has suffered another blow – meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby’s International Realty: “As annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The ‘Spring Bounce’ is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here’s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today’s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here’s the government’s response to today’s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: “Inflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers £160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to £7.83 an hour.” The pound is acting more like the ‘Great British Peso’ right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: “As the dust settles on yesterday’s ‘Wild West’ style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling’s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England’s upcoming decision. Today’s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the ‘unreliable boyfriend’ resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today’s Prime Minister’s Questions.” Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week’s time, May’s government will get a much needed ‘breathing space’ in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short ‘time window of opportunity’ for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the ‘interest-rate can’ down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers’ pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: ”UK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. “The unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. “Despite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. “The stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.” UK inflation is still over the Bank of England’s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. “Financial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it’s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of £100 in today’s money could be halved in 20 years’ time. June’s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That’s particularly the case after yesterday’s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from ‘political trauma’, as well as today’s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning’s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the “political shenanigans in Westminster” are also weighing on the pound, following last night’s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain’s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men’s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men’s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain’s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That’s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU’s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline’s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn’t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM’s precarious position, City investors aren’t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM’s challenge is “Like herding cats”. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today’s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn’t strong enough. It’s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America’s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: “The unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them.” The agenda 9.30am BST: UK inflation date for June 9.30am BST: UK house price data for May 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for June 3pm BST: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifying to the US House of Representatives"

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump is #winning. On the back of an already excellent week where he was gifted a football and impeded a monarch, right now the president is also leaping up Google’s image search rankings, to pole position. When you type the word “idiot” into Google’s image search, Trump is the first returned result. This is partly because the Green Day song American Idiot was used by protesters to soundtrack his trip to London. But since then there’s also been a concerted campaign to capitalize on that association, and manipulate Google’s algorithm, by linking the word to the picture. Mostly this involved people upvoting a post containing a photo of him and the word “idiot” on Reddit. This may seem unfair to his most fervent supporters. But if there’s one thing Google is keen to emphasize, it’s that search ain’t fair. The company has always refused to play God when it comes to their algorithm. Even when the search term “Jew” started returning a hook-nosed caricature in 2004, rather than delete the image, they instead took out ads next to it to explain why antisemitic imagery, as well as antisemitic websites like “Jew Watch”, were appearing so high up the results. “A site’s ranking in Google’s search results relies heavily on computer algorithms using thousands of factors to calculate a page’s relevance to a given query,” they explained. “Sometimes subtleties of language cause anomalies to appear that cannot be predicted.” They continued with that line of argument when, in 2009, searches for “Michelle Obama” began returning a picture of the first lady’s face retouched to have ape-like features. Again, the company decided to raise awareness alongside it rather than tinker. The famous algorithm is constantly being reworked, but only to make it more useful, not more culturally sensitive. After all, opening the door to one manual review might open the door to them all. The fact that the system can still be gamed is surprising, and judging the scale of its effect is controversial, not least because media articles about the “controversy” feed into it. Searching “rapist” before the US election was likely to bring up at least five images of Bill Clinton in the top 10. Threads that tagged the 42nd president were making it to the front page of Reddit, already in the top 20 most visited websites according to traffic ranking site Alexa. From a platform that large, it was a short hop to the top of the rankings. Many of these were rudimentary, almost meaningless. “RAPIST! RAPIST! RAPIST! RAPIST!” “Today this rapist turns 70. Happy Birthday, rapist.” Most originated from the notorious Reddit forum TheDonald, where fans of Trump congregated to spread his gospel of doing whatever you like, screw the consequences. The forum moderators would pin a post to the top of the forum to encourage others to upvote it, and the swell of upvotes would push it to the front page of Reddit, which already styles itself “The front page of the Internet”, causing it to leap up to the top row of Google images. For example, for the term “fake news”, TheDonald’s team managed to get CNN’s logo up the charts. Likewise, for a long time Redditors battled US telecoms giant Comcast, trying to get a swastika to the top of the company’s image searches by posting the company’s name over and over beneath the hooked cross. They later tried the same with photo sharing site Imgur. It was a perfect wheeze for a while, but while Google’s algorithm is opaque, it is clear the effect also seems to fade rapidly. The Clinton images no longer appear. In 2013, the English Disco Lovers movement was started as a deliberate Google bomb to hijack the search results of the English Defence League, the far-right movement founded by Tommy Robinson. It worked. But as people continued to prefer anti-Islam rhetoric to Sister Sledge, it faded down the rankings, until it became what it is now – seventh on the second page. In less trafficked queries, though, the link can persist. “Sick person opens jar of pickles” still points to several pictures of Hillary Clinton doing exactly that on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The irony, as you may be aware, is that despite there being no provable link between the concepts, an article in the Guardian featuring a picture of Donald Trump and the word “idiot” will only reinforce the results further. Let’s hope no one clicks on this or links to it, and say only, very soberly: “Trump Trump Trump Trump idiot idiot idiot idiot.” • This article was amended on 20 July 2018 because an earlier version referred to “poll position”."

          "bodyText": "Fifteen years ago, Lorna Blakeney thought she had a lump of mucus in her eye. “I was sitting reading a book after lunch and suddenly realised there was something in my left eye. I tried to blink and rub it away. I thought a night’s sleep would help. But in the morning, it was still there. I didn’t do anything about it for two weeks, which was stupid of me, especially as my daughter is an optometrist.” Lorna’s daughter sent her mum straight to an ophthalmologist. “But it was too late. I was diagnosed with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD); there was no treatment in those days and I was told there was an 82% chance that my other eye would go, too.” Lorna’s daughter, Dr Sue Blakeney, is a clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists. She says that what happened to her mum is not uncommon. “Macular degeneration causes damage to the part of the retina responsible for central vision. It affects one eye first, so you often don’t notice it unless you close one eye at a time; you can be almost blind in one eye and not be aware of it.” Lorna is even more pithy: “You have two eyes – make sure you compare them. One is often stronger than the other, but if things change, get help.” Ophthalmologist Pearse Keane of Moorfields eye hospital in London says that AMD is the most common cause of irreversible sight loss in the UK and Europe. “Every day in the UK alone, nearly 200 people develop the severe, blinding forms of AMD. There are two main forms of AMD – a ‘dry’ type and the ‘wet’ one. Wet AMD has nothing to do with watery eyes but is so-called because abnormal blood vessels grow under the centre of the retina (the nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye). These blood vessels leak fluid and bleed easily, and this can cause severe visual loss because it is such a sensitive area.” Keane says that, until about 10 years ago, there was no effective treatment for the wet form of AMD, but now it can be treated with regular injections of drugs such as Eylea or Lucentis into the eye. They block the growth of new blood vessels and reduce the leakage of fluid from existing vessels. This improves sight substantially in about a third of patients and prevents further worsening of vision in about 95% of cases. However, the effects of the drugs last only one to two months, so people need frequent injections over long periods of time. Andrew Lotery, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southampton, says everyone over 50 should at least be aware that if they have a loss of vision in one eye that is not corrected when they put on their glasses, then it could be rapidly developing wet AMD. “You should be seen in hospital within a week because scarring develops if wet AMD is left untreated.” Optometrists and ophthalmic practitioners (doctors trained to examine eyes) can look for early signs of macular degeneration and will refer on urgently if they are concerned. In the past, diagnosis relied on a slit-lamp examination – a contact lens put on the eye and observed through a microscope looking for thickening of the retina – and a fluorescein angiogram (FA), which involves an injection into a vein in the arm to highlight blood vessels in the eye. But “FA makes lots of people sick and occasionally causes severe allergic reactions,” says Lotery. Happily, there is an alternative now. “The initial diagnosis of wet AMD, and the need for follow-up treatments, is determined with a form of retinal imaging called optical coherence tomography (OCT),” says Keane. OCT is a relatively new form of medical imaging, having been around since 1991. It is analogous to ultrasound except that it measures the reflection of light waves, rather than sound. Most people with known retinal disease have an OCT scan at every hospital eye clinic appointment and get offered more injections into the eye if there are signs of “fluid”. Lotery says the price of OCT machines are coming down all the time although they still cost around £50,000 each. There are also now handheld OCTs, which some believe will make detecting eye disease as “easy as scanning a barcode”, but Lotery urges caution: “Don’t rush out to buy one. You still need a trained health professional to interpret the results – it’s easy to misinterpret them.” Machines are also being trained in diagnostic techniques. Google’s DeepMind has used data from thousands of OCT scans to develop an algorithm that can diagnose wet AMD at least as quickly and effectively as eye specialists can. A partnership with Moorfields and the NHS will shortly publish more detailed results. AMD develops as the eye ages – and Blakeney says other risk factors include a family history of AMD, smoking, excessive exposure to UV light and, possibly, to screens. Maintaining a normal weight may be protective and there is probably a role for foods that contain dietary pigments, such as blueberries and peppers. “There is no good evidence that the general population should take supplements, but if you already have AMD in one eye, it may be advisable.” Dry AMD is less severe than wet, progresses over years rather than months and causes more gradual loss of central vision. “Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for dry AMD, although there are many clinical trials under way,” says Keane. The exciting developments in diagnosis and treatment of wet AMD have come too late for Lorna Blakeney. She is one of the 360,000 people in the UK who are registered as blind or visually impaired. Six years after her initial diagnosis, Lorna noticed that the venetian blinds in her bathroom window looked wiggly in her remaining sighted eye. “This time, I had injections of the drug Lucentis into my eye. I thought it would be a magic bullet; it is for many, but it wasn’t for me. Gradually, I lost the sight in the eye and I’m now registered as severely sight impaired, with only a bit of peripheral vision left.” “There is life after AMD. I manage pretty well, with every gadget known to man.” She uses software on her phone and a tablet with “speaking” icons, has voice recognition software to dictate emails, a talking watch, clock, kitchen scales, measuring jug and microwave. One gadget rests on the edge of a mug and beeps twice; once for the water and once for the milk, to make a perfect cup of tea without spillages. Another clips on to her glasses and scans and speaks the writing on food labels in the supermarket. Lorna says all these aids are enormously helpful, but they don’t come cheap and most are not subsidised. “If I go out on my own, I have a symbol cane to let other people know that I can’t see them although I have enough peripheral vision that I can move around without bumping into things. Not being able to read is biggest nuisance. One very posh British restaurant we went to had the French ‘mesdames’ and ‘messieurs’ in pale grey letters on a pale-green sign. I didn’t stand a chance.”"

          "bodyText": "The radical geographer and equality evangelist Danny Dorling tried to explain to me once why an algorithm could be bad for social justice. Imagine if email inboxes became intelligent: your messages would be prioritised on arrival, so if the recipient knew you and often replied to you, you’d go to the top; I said that was fine. That’s how it works already. If they knew you and never replied, you’d go to the bottom, he continued. I said that was fair – it would teach me to stop annoying that person. If you were a stranger, but typically other people replied to you very quickly – let’s say you were Barack Obama – you’d sail right to the top. That seemed reasonable. And if you were a stranger who others usually ignored, you’d fall off the face of the earth. “Well, maybe they should get an allotment and stop emailing people,” I said. “Imagine how angry those people would be,” Dorling said. “They already feel invisible and they [would] become invisible by design.” The capacity of tech to outstrip the worst imaginings of its detractors is truly incredible. Prioritising emails turned out to be small fry for big data, which turned its attentions instead to simply ranking people, not for the interest they might hold in an inbox, but for their value as customers, employees, tenants – for all practical purposes, their value as human beings. The Chinese government is working towards assigning its citizens a “social score”: by 2020, an algorithm will rate citizens as a “desirable employee, reliable tenant, valuable customer – or a deadbeat, shirker, menace and waste of time”, in the words of two US academics. “Waste of time”, it strikes me, is a more searing criticism than “deadbeat”, which sounds quite rakish and rebellious. Algorithms don’t understand nuance, because it saves time not to. But the erasure of small degrees of human difference is the least bad thing about it. The scored society, as the New Economics Foundation calls it in its report, What’s Your Score?, is everywhere: it is just more pronounced in China because the government is not embarrassed about it. All our debates about the use of big data have centred on privacy, and all seem a bit distant: I care, in principle, whether or not Ocado knows what I bought on Amazon. But in my truest heart, I don’t really care whether or not my Frube vendor knows that I also like dystopian fiction of the 1970s. I do, however, care that a program exists that will determine my eligibility for a loan by how often I call my mother. I care if landlords are using tools to rank their tenants by compliant behaviour, to create a giant, shared platform of desirable tenants, who never complain about black mould and greet each rent increase with a basket of muffins. I care if the police in Durham are using Experian credit scores to influence their custodial decisions, an example – as you may have guessed by its specificity – that is already real. I care that the same credit-rating company has devised a Mosaic score, which splits households into comically bigoted stereotypes: if your name is Liam and you are an “avid texter”, that puts you in “disconnected youth”, while if you’re Asha you’re in “crowded kaleidoscope”. It’s not a privacy issue so much as a profiling one, although, as anyone who has ever been the repeated victim of police stop-and-search could have told me years ago, these are frequently the same thing. Privacy isn’t the right to keep secrets: it’s the right to be an individual, not a type; the right to make a choice that’s entirely your own; the right to be private. The answer is structural. I’m as sick now of being told to delete my Facebook account as I was 20 years ago of being told that turning plugs off would halt climate change. We need better laws, fast, or we’ll all be deadbeats in the end. Dominic Raab – the Tories’ new ultra Give Theresa May the benefit of all possible doubt: understand the position in which she finds herself, shorn of allies, her enemies emboldened, permanent private secretaries resigning in droves over matters of conscience that five days ago they seemed OK about. Also imagine, as is the vogue, that she is more intelligent than she looks. The appointment of Dominic Raab as Brexit secretary, successor to the departing David thick-as-mince Davis, could, in this light, be because she can’t stand Raab either and has given him the task as you might throw a stick off a cliff for an unwanted dog. He remains a controversial choice, holding – per Labour’s pithy, timely video – views about as unpleasant as you could imagine in a Tory, past or present. Food bank users have a “cashflow problem”, properly funded universal healthcare is a “childish wishlist”, social and economic justice are for the birds, feminists are “obnoxious bigots” , getting rid of employment rights would be good for prosperity – his utterances are like a greatest hits of all the incurious, contrarian, lazy, Singapore-in-the-Channel banality that has become the Tories’ party piece since they uncoupled from the Lib Dems and stopped having to look at evidence, listen to people, consider the success of a nation as the sum of its peoples’ happiness, all that social crap. Once, you would have known a Conservative ultra by the way he dressed and sounded: cummerbunds, monocles, flutey Rees-Mogg voices, fob watches – they had a whole range of flagging devices so that you knew when to stop listening. Now, they walk among one another as though they are all the same, extremists dressing like the garden-variety defenders of the propertied class, making it impossible to know whom you should engage in argument and whom you just ward off with garlic and a crucifix. “It’s not my brief,” Raab said, when I met him a few weeks ago on Radio 5 Live, and asked whether the famous white paper on the Brexit plan had actually been written. Ha. It is now, sucker. The end of the world? I’d know about it – wouldn’t I? My kids saw the RAF flypast this week and reached, in concert with their school peers, the conclusion that it was the start of a nuclear war, which Donald Trump had started to coincide with his arrival. I didn’t want to be a buzzkill, but I thought I should point out some basic principles about the onset of the apocalypse. It wouldn’t start with synchronised planes flying in the shape of a 100, unless someone had a really dark sense of humour. And it would probably commence on the continent you were furthest away from. After that, I was out. “It won’t happen without me knowing,” I tailed off weakly, implausibly."

          "bodyText": "Moonlighting Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis spent the mid-80s in screwball comedy Moonlighting, and it is about time the Blue Moon detective agency found a mass audience again. Not afraid to let characters break the fourth wall or bring in Orson Welles for a cameo, Moonlighting was a groundbreaking show packed with frisky one-liners as Maddie and David flirted through gritted teeth. Shepherd smouldered as Maddie, an ex-model trying to make a living as a private investigator while displaying the best workwear wardrobe of her era. Willis was a world away from his Die Hard persona, and was the perfect foil to her seriousness. They were the Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant of their time, a pairing made all the more delicious by rumours that they fought off-set as well as on it. Sure, Moonlighting would appear dated now, but it is ripe for a streaming rerun. HV The Larry Sanders Show All the other big American 90s sitcoms have wised up. When Friends and Seinfeld were sold to streaming services, it seemed like a no-brainer; not only were they regaining their slot in the cultural conversation but they were earning millions of dollars in the process. And yet The Larry Sanders Show – a much better, more groundbreaking series that deserves endless adoring reappraisals – has yet to make the jump . Even with all the terrible band segments that clogged up later series, it remains utterly peerless. SH Olive Kitteridge Earlier this year, Frances McDormand won her second Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, in which she played the blunt and belligerent Mildred Hayes, determined to avenge the murder of her daughter. Those craving more of Mildred’s plain-talking will find it in Olive Kitteridge, Lisa Cholodenko’s HBO adaptation of the novel that won Elizabeth Strout the Pulitzer prize in 2008. It is a story that doesn’t necessarily feel like a natural fit for the screen, as it shifts and slides over time and characters, but this is a hugely impressive interpretation of it. McDormand is astonishingly good as the misanthropic Olive, whose husband adores her as much as her son grows up to resent her shifting moods. In spite of its star cast, including Bill Murray, Jesse Plemons and Ann Dowd, it resists ever being showy, instead settling in as an elegant, grown-up, beautifully observed portrait of a life, or rather, a number of them. RN Cheers Neither this barroom comedy nor its more urbane spin-off, Frasier, are available to stream in the UK, but Frasier does at least have the consolation prize of having its tossed salad and scrambled eggs sandwiched between Everybody Loves Raymond and Car SOS on Channel 4 every morning. Cheers, though, is nowhere to be seen in the schedules or on the streaming sites, a strange fate for a sitcom that, other than the irredeemably tainted Cosby Show, was the most popular of its era. What’s more, Cheers remains truly, indisputably great. Sure, it might look slightly creaky to millennial viewers: a relic from the more stagey era of sitcoms, rendered extinct first by the ironic detachment of Seinfeld, then by single-camera comedies such as Scrubs, The Office and 30 Rock. But it is a virtually note-perfect version of that archaic style of sitcommery, with a murderer’s row of a cast – Danson! Long! Harrelson! Alley! Grammer! All deeply flawed schmoes you genuinely cared about and gags that never failed to land. At a time when, remarkably, old-school spit-and-sawdust sitcoms are making a comeback, there is surely a place in Netflix’s algorithm for a classic of the genre. GM Camping Julia Davis’s mid-life masterpiece Camping is one of the funniest shows to ever sneak on to TV. Every member of the ensemble cast, trapped on a couples’ camping trip, is a hide-behind-the-cushion delight. There’s Adam (Jonathan Cake), a recovering alcoholic, dead-eyed with desperation, and Vicki Pepperdine’s controlling monster Fiona who is paranoid her son is showing “symptoms” of homosexuality. But the real genius emerges when giddy escapee of married life Tom (Rufus Jones) turns up with his rejuvenated hair, and lederhosen-stealing sex bomb Faye (Davis). Her skirts are as short as the time between their noisy humping sessions and all onlookers are scandalised/intrigued, depending on their life state. Lena Dunham’s US remake may have Jennifer Garner and Juliette Lewis on board, but how the grotesque masturbation jokes will survive is anyone’s guess. The original needs to be appreciated in all its disgusting glory now. HV Buffy the Vampire Slayer It is a bit of a mystery why Buffy the Vampire Slayer hasn’t made it to streaming: the key formative show in the Joss Whedon canon, Sarah Michelle Gellar leads the line like a natural, and it virtually wrote the book on the whole supernatural shenanigans-equals teen-traumas. Its side characters have gone down in legend (David Boreanaz, so hunky he even turned up in a Dido video; Seth Green, so annoying he got to be Scott Evil); and the formal gags (you know, the astounding all-singing episode Once More, With Feeling) were radical in their day. But it was Whedon’s hotline to the teenage mindset that really made Buffy so great: my favourite episodes were the ones where some kids were so ignored they literally disappeared, and the cheerleading mum/witch who bodyswapped with her daughter to relive her glory days. AP The Irish RM A 1980s TV adaptation based on the short stories of a female Anglo-Irish writing team, Somerville &amp; Ross, The Irish RM is set in the years prior to partition around the turn of the 20th century, when Ireland was still wholly a part of the United Kingdom. Peter Bowles stars as the halting, ineffectual Major Sinclair Yeates, who takes up the position of resident magistrate in the west of Ireland. There is no violent uprising against his attempts at authority; he is merely outfoxed at every turn by the rural locals, set in their ways of drunkenness and shady dealing. Yeates even finds himself embarrassingly embroiled in local intrigues thanks to his roguish friend Flurry Knox. The most formidable and funniest character of all, however, is housekeeper Mrs Cadogan, played by Anna Manahan, an interpreter of Joyce, O’ Casey and Wilde among others. DS 15 Storeys High Originally a radio series called Sean Lock’s 15 Minutes Of Misery, 15 Storeys High was an excellent TV vehicle for a comedian nowadays best known for panel shows. Lock stars as Vince Clark, a swimming instructor of sorts, who lives in a towerblock with haplessly eccentric flatmate Errol (Benedict Wong). The block is home to a variety of characters who appear to have missed out altogether on the euphoria of the 1990s, isolated specimens of an abidingly bleak Britain. The mildly irascible Vince’s interactions with the locals are hilarious, especially the local ragamuffins, including a deep-throated 10-year-old boy and a religious zealot working as a meter reader. Interspersed with his high-rise, low-level misadventures are vignettes featuring other residents of the block, including one young man who emerges from a testy exchange with a female call-centre operator with a tentpole erection. It ran for two series but was a victim of poor scheduling and was cancelled. DS Bill Brand Television political fiction these days tends to mean a conspiracy thriller but, in 1976, this ITV peak-time show seriously examined the tension in the parliamentary Labour party between pragmatism and radicalism; governing Britain and changing it. This only worked because writer Trevor Griffiths created such complex and compelling people, led by Jack Shepherd as the title character, a leftwinger uneasy in a party led by slippery centrist PM Arthur Watson, played by Arthur Lowe in a fascinating sabbatical from his Captain Mainwaring in Dad’s Army. A perfect box-set companion to the rehearsal of the same arguments in the Corbyn era. ML Northern Exposure Sprawling, ambitious and open-ended, Northern Exposure was the prototype modern TV series. It ostensibly told the story of Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), a snarky young medic from New York posted, to his intense irritation, in a beautiful Alaskan backwater called Cicely. Think Twin Peaks, with the surreal horror replaced by meditative, down-home philosophy, and you are somewhere near. Paving the way for TV golden age turn-of-the-century epics such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, the show was years ahead of its time when it premiered in 1990. However, Northern Exposure is old-fashioned in one, very crucial way. If you want to watch it in 2018, you have to buy the DVDs. And even then, you have to be careful if you don’t want to end up with a version of the show whose immaculately selected soundtrack has been replaced by muzak mulch. And here lies the problem. One of the main characters Chris Stevens, a community DJ, usually bookended the show with a thematically appropriate song. And licencing those songs has proved prohibitively expensive. In the era of companies such as Netflix being willing to throw money at comparatively niche enterprises, it seems strange that no one has yet rescued Northern Exposure from box-set oblivion. PH The Wonder Years Not many shows so ably depict the woes of the fully-formed adults we thought we were aged 12. Heading the group of 1960s US baby boomers that included nerdy Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano, no relation to Marilyn Manson, swear it) was Kevin Arnold, played by the impossibly cute Fred Savage. His pained expressions sold the idea that each puberty-stricken interaction with Winnie (Danica McKellar) was the most critical happening in the world, even with the Vietnam war as the backdrop. A rewatch would also allow us a mighty game of spot the bit-part actors who went on to be famous (Juliette Lewis, Alicia Silverstone and David Schwimmer are among them). Painfully, Netflix airs the six seasons in their entirety but only in the US, because of copyright issues. And not even Netflix could secure the rights to the theme tune, Joe Cocker’s cover of With a Little Help from My Friends. SG The West Wing Watching The West Wing in England has always been, for me, a slightly fraught experience. The Aaron Sorkin-written show’s seven undulating seasons were aired erratically on UK channels between 2000 and 2006, when I was busy with exams and watching endless reruns of Will &amp; Grace. When I finally realised what I had been missing, I had to resort to “borrowing” the DVDs one at a time from my dad’s prized box set, and spent a glorious summer inhaling walk-and-talks, pining for Josh Lyman, and replying “you think?” to perfectly innocuous statements. Perhaps it’s the show’s sensibilities, which are so firmly pre-streaming, that mean no online services in the UK have snapped up The West Wing on any sort of permanent basis. MP 30 Rock Tina Fey’s comedy show about a comedy show is single-handedly saving my DVD player from retirement. The show has enjoyed fleeting appearances on streaming sites in the UK – a travesty given that it is ripe for repeated watching. There’s Tracey Morgan’s did-he-just-say-that lines, Liz Lemon’s gif-able pratfalls, and Alec Baldwin’s Emmy-worthy performance as the VP of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming. The freedom of streaming random episodes might also uncover those buried in the avalanche of its 138-show run, such as The Bubble, in which Lemon finds out how the beautiful people live courtesy of Mad Men’s Jon Hamm, in a rare successful comedy turn. At the very least, it needs mass distribution to breathe life into its references that have only half-made it into the modern lexicon (“I want to go to there”). Write to your MP demanding action, stat. SG Human Remains Rob Brydon and Julia Davis only made six episodes of Human Remains, in 2000; 18 years and three DVD copies of it later, I can still quote practically every word. These half-hour comedies – if you can call them that – tell the stories of six unhappy couples, mockumentary-style. There’s George and Sheila, who own the B&amp;B that also doubles up as a swingers’ retreat, and Beverly and Tony, the deeply devout couple practically stalking their local vicar through the medium of curly sausage casseroles. While deeply, darkly funny, the show is also unsparing in its savagery, whether it’s the couple suspected of murdering their children, or the doomed Stephen and Michelle, a naive Princess Diana devotee (“Why her? Why not me?”). There has never been anything quite like it. RN Smiley’s People Smiley’s People, the sequel to the BBC’s 1979 adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, takes Alec Guinness’s portrayal of George Smiley and doubles down on everything that made for counterintuitively riveting television the first time around. John Le Carré’s spymaster is now sadder, more tired, more alert to betrayal and demands from every corner. His glasses are somehow even thicker and more owlish than ever. Over the six episodes, we get the blueprint for most of the 21st century’s most successful spy shows. Clandestine meetings on park benches, secretive conclaves in stately homes, flits through dark woods, and a bravura way with wigs and trenchcoats. Without Smiley’s People, there would be no Spooks, no Americans, no Homeland. It’s a shame that it is nowhere to be found online, as it deserves to be more appreciated, but the “we just blew the dust off the reels and stuck it on digital” quality of the show on DVD only adds to its slow, peculiar charms. MP Nice Work Adapted by David Lodge from his 1988 Booker-shortlisted novel, this smart four-parter featured a scheme seeking to foster links between culture and business by pairing representatives of each in a “work shadow” scheme. Hadyn Gwynne, as a feminist academic, is reluctantly coupled with Warren Clarke’s tetchy Thatcherite industrialist. The scripts trusted the audience to cope with clever jokes and literary references, while the main roles brought to Clarke and Gwynne a recognition that led to star turns in Dalziel and Pascoe and Drop the Dead Donkey respectively. ML Lost One of my favourite podcasts at the moment is Lost Boys, where a Lost fan guides a Lost newcomer through all of Lost, an episode at a time. It’s compelling stuff, and your first instinct after listening is always to track down Lost and rewatch it yourself. But you can’t, because it isn’t anywhere. It used to be on Netflix, and you would expect it to be somewhere on Now TV, but it has vanished, like some sort of mysterious island. If you want to watch Lost in 2018 you have to physically pay for it. And not even I like Lost enough for that. SH What do you want to see come to streaming? Let us know in the comments below"

          "bodyText": "Twitter users will see a drop in their follower counts this week as the company clamps down on “problematic” accounts including those that have been hijacked to spread abuse, misinformation and propaganda. Starting on Wednesday, Twitter will remove all locked accounts from people’s follower numbers. Most people will see a change of “four followers or fewer” but accounts with larger followings will experience a “more significant drop”, the company said. Twitter locks accounts when it detects “sudden changes in account behaviour” – for example, if the account tweets a large volume of unsolicited replies or mentions; if the account posts misleading links; or if a large number of other accounts block the account in question. Accounts can also be locked if the platform finds that someone’s login credentials have been leaked elsewhere, for example through a data breach at another service. In both cases, Twitter contacts the owners of the account and asks them to validate the account and reset their password. If the owner doesn’t comply, the account remains locked. “In most cases, these accounts were created by real people, but we cannot confirm that the original person who opened the account still has control and access to it,” said Vijaya Gadde, from Twitter’s trust and safety team, in a blogpost. Twitter said these accounts were different from spam accounts, which typically exhibit spammy behaviour from the beginning and so are easier to identify. Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed, who has been an outspoken critic of “toxic” social media content, welcomed the update. “Our digital ecosystem is being polluted by a growing number of fake user accounts, so Twitter’s commitment to cleaning up the digital space should be welcomed wholeheartedly by everyone, from users of the platforms, to creators and advertisers,” he said. “People having an artificially-inflated follower count made up of bots and redundant accounts is at best deceiving and at worst, fraud. It serves no one and undermines trust in the entire system.” The crackdown is part of Twitter’s renewed effort to build trust and foster a more “healthy” conversation on the platform. “Follower counts are a visible feature, and we want everyone to have confidence that the numbers are meaningful and accurate,” Gadde said. In March, Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, pledged to tackle the rampant harassment, bots, misinformation and polarisation in a more strategic way. “We aren’t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough,” Dorsey tweeted. “We’ve focused most of our efforts on removing content against our terms, instead of building a systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking. This is the approach we need now.” In May, the company announced a global change to its ranking algorithm to push tweets from bothersome accounts lower down the in the list of replies or search results, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of mob harassment against a particular user."

          "bodyText": "Experts say the western ideal of romantic love is constantly disappointing us. Which is a shame because our culture loves romantic love. It’s an idea that pervades pop music, novels, TV and film. Somewhere out there our perfect match is waiting to meet us, so the theory goes. But maybe love isn’t really about The One. Maybe the early films of Richard Curtis don’t have all the answers. So what is love, actually? There are many answers to this question, says the anthropologist Anna Machin, but let’s start with an evolutionary explanation. Basically, love helps a species to cooperate. “We need to cooperate to survive, to subsist, to learn, to reproduce and to raise our children,” she says. “Romantic and parental love is essentially the neurochemical reward for cooperating, which is cognitively quite difficult.” It’s a kind of biological bribery, in other words. Love is the basis of animal attachment, distinct from lust or sex drive. But forget about the myth of love at first sight, Machin says. “There is lust at first sight. When someone experiences lust, their amygdala – the ancient, central part of the brain responsible for emotion – is releasing the neurochemicals dopamine and oxytocin. Dopamine is a general reward chemical, which makes you feel euphoric, warm and motivated to form a relationship with someone. Oxytocin works to lower your inhibitions to forming a relationship.” This attraction, Machin explains, is triggered by physical signs of a good mate, such as an ideal 0.7 waist-hip ratio in women or a highly symmetrical face. The neurochemical processes of love are more complex, and last longer than lust. As well as the amygdala, love involves the neocortex – the part of the brain responsible for social cognition. “That’s where all the trust, empathy, planning ahead and trying to coordinate your life with the person you’re in love with sits,” says Machin. During love, the brain is flooded with an opiate called beta-endorphin. “Beta-endorphin is addictive,” Machin says, “so when you’re in love with someone, you are addicted to the release of beta-endorphin you receive when you interact with them. When you’re away from them, you go into a kind of withdrawal. As a consequence you go back and get another hit.” Our experiences of love are influenced by factors beyond spontaneous emotion. Jess Carbino, a sociologist who works for the dating app Bumble, says the way we seek love is complex, but it’s “a romantic myth” to call it random. “People are very deliberate about finding love,” she says. “When we are looking for romantic partners, for example, people are very realistic about who they look for in the dating market, based on their own physical attractiveness.” Carbino reckons this dating market has always existed in some form; the advent of online dating apps just made it more visible. “In theory, prior to the emergence of online dating, people were speculating about what the market was because they could only see a fraction of it. Now you’re embedded in a variety of markets online – not just your work market or your religious market, but every market available within a geographic radius within the age and gender you’re looking for.” There is no algorithm for love, though both our experiences and our genetics influence our preferences in a partner. In her book Anatomy of Love, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher calls this our “love map”. She writes: ”[A]s you grow up, you build a conscious (and unconscious) list of traits you are looking for in a mate; then, with time and experiences, this vision of an ideal partner crystallises. Drugs can’t change these memories, these experiences, this mental template.” It is these differing expectations and experiences that can cause relationships to fail, says Kathrine Bejanyan, a relationship consultant . “Where I see the biggest problem is not necessarily people falling in love, it’s sustaining it,” she explains. These clashes can stem from our family upbringing, for instance. “Say you grew up in a family where love was shown through giving gifts when you got a good grade, that person experienced gift-giving as an expression as love. Another person with a different upbringing might understand love and how to receive it differently.” From a theological perspective, says Werner Jeanrond, a Catholic theologian at Oxford University, “love invites us to a much deeper way of seeing”. Jeanrond says all forms of love are united and defined “by the challenge of otherness” (the “other” being the opposite of the self). Jeanrond argues that love involves engaging with otherness in at least four ways. “There is the other human being, in an intersubjective relationship. Then there is our relationship to the cosmos or the universe or nature. Then there is the question of God or ultimate reality – how can you relate to the radical other? And most problematic is our relationship to ourselves – can I love me?” The opposite of love is therefore not hatred but indifference, Jeanrond says. “I think people see that wrongly. Hatred is a warped love, but it is still interested and obsessed with the other. Indifference is the opposite of love because they don’t even see the other.” As Jeanrond points out, love is relative, diverse and not always conspicuous. It has countless definitions, depending on who you ask. But perhaps the real mystery is how these definitions fit together. • Alfie Packham is the editor of Guardian Students"

          "bodyText": "And with that, I’m out of here. We are another day closer to the World Cup semi-finals, which this time tomorrow will be just a couple of hours away. And if that’s all we’ve achieved today, at least it’s something. Bye! Oh, and here’s a quiz! Here’s Reuters on that Hugo Lloris press conference. Fireworks it ain’t. Captain Hugo Lloris feels France are ready for the challenge of taking on a Belgium outfit who “know how to do everything” in Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final. Lloris said at a pre-match press conference: “They are an exhaustive team, they know how to do everything. I think the Belgian team is the most exhaustive team in all aspects of the game during this tournament - they are strong everywhere. They have everything they need to be a great team and and they are a great team. “It is a fantastic generation and in order to beat them we will have to play a great match. “We know there are going to be difficult moments, and we’ll have to be ready to suffer. But we will be ready because we have an extremely good state of mind, and it is the semi-finals in the World Cup. It is an opportunity in our careers and we have to grab it with both hands.” Let’s get quizzical: “In the 2006 final, Cannavaro and Zidane were captains,” writes Olivier. “Both were Real Madrid players at the date of the final, although Cannavaro had just joined 9 days before from Juventus, and Zidane retired the next day.” Not so, though: Zidane had announced his retirement in April 2006, and official retired as the final whitle sounded. That was on 9 July 2006, and Real announced the arrival of Cannavaro on 19 July. Close, but it doesn’t count. Nothing springs to mind, but having said that I have been liveblogging a rest day at the World Cup for most of the last seven and a half hours, so my mind is a little addled. Domagoj Vida, the Croatia defender, appears to have got away with the “glory to Ukraine” video that was posted online after his team’s victory over Russia in the quarter-finals. His partner in crime, Ognjen Vukojevic, has not been so lucky. This from the Press Association: Croatia’s Football Federation (HNS) sacked Ognjen Vukojevic, a member of the national team’s coaching staff, over a “glory to Ukraine” video posted after Croatia beat Russia in the World Cup quarter-finals, HNS said in a statement on Monday. Vukojevic and Croatia defender Domagoj Vida published the video on social media after the match on Saturday, which was criticised by Russian politicians and led to a warning from FIFA’s disciplinary committee. Relations between Ukraine and World Cup hosts Russia remain fraught after the latter’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula and its backing for a pro-Russian uprising in the east of the country. HNS said it has revoked Vukojevic’s team accreditation at the World Cup and relieved him of his duties as an observer for the Croatia squad. “HNS hereby apologises to the Russian public for the actions of a member of the Croatian delegation,” it said. It said that Vukojevic and Vida also apologised for their statements, saying they were not intended to be political messages but “unfortunately left room for such interpretations”. Both Vukojevic and the 29-year-old Vida previously played for Ukrainian club Dynamo Kiev. Deschamps is asked for his thoughts about Russia’s team. He’s not impressed: Are you sure you asked me that question? Do I really have to talk about Russia? I don’t really see the point. Let’s move on. He’s asked about Belgium’s tactical tweaking against Brazil, and whether he’s expecting more surprises tomorrow: My team will be ready for different scenarios, different formations. This Belgium team didn’t get here by chance, they played a great game against Brazil with a very specific gameplan. Will they do something similar against us? Well, probably. When they get the ball, this Belgium team is really able to perform. They attack very well and very fast. I have made sure my players are prepared for any scenario, with different formations at the beginning of the match or during the match if it changes. Didier Deschamps is talking now, about facing a team he knows very well: We know them, they know us. The peculiarity is that there are many players on my team who have club team-mates facing them. It’s an advantage to both teams. During the match everyone will be on their own side, and we will do everything to seize any opportunity to reach the final of the World Cup. Hugo Lloris has just eulogised Raphael Varane, “a great player and a great person”. Which brings us to this: In occasional England international news, Jack Wilshere has signed for West Ham, agreeing a three-year contract. Here’s Hugo Lloris on Thierry Henry, Belgium coach: I played with him for two seasons in the French team, and he was a great player. It is true it is a little peculiar to see him with the Belgium team, but that is his career and that’s how he’s building his future. I think his heart will be split tomorrow, because before everything he is French. He has lived through great moments in the blue jersey. He scored the most goals, is second in terms of number of caps. We know him, he has a lot of passion for football and he will be with the Belgians and will give everything to help his team. Lloris is asked about Belgium’s team: There will be a lot of great players on the pitch tomorrow. So it is bound to be a great match, a high-level match, and we will have to raise our level again to keep up the standards we set in the Round of 16 and the quarter-finals. The France press conference has begun, with Hugo Lloris being asked about the stadium in St Petersburg. It’s a magnificent stadium. We have a good memory of our match here in March when we played Russia. I think it’s a magnificent stadium for a fantastic match, like the World Cup semi-final. And it’s with great honour and pride that we will represent our country at this event. The Uruguay team have just arrived in Montevideo following their elimination from the World Cup in the quarter-finals. BONG! It’s World Cup Fiver o’clock! Birthday boy Ashley Young has been speaking to the press today. I’m sure a full report will be over shortly, but from the snippets sneaking through on the wires it seems he’s been going big on negatives: We have put ourselves in a great position to go on and win it. I said before the start of the tournament, ‘We’re not going out there not to win the World Cup.’ Croatia are a very good team. They are not in the semi-final for no reason. We have got to be prepared for them. Right, Simon is fed and refreshed and ready to go again. But I’ll leave you with something that I missed in the BBC’s coverage of the England match on Saturday. As a fan of The National’s earlier work, I very much enjoyed this. Bye. Richard Williams is a firm believer that great World Cup sides of the past have been built around ego-free forwards – and in Raheem Sterling, England have got a cunning attacker who is utterly irreplaceable. If the World Cup has taken over your life like an algorithm at a social media behemoth, then you may have missed some transfer news. But never fear, Niall McVeigh is here to fill you in on the crucial moves that have passed you by. If you fancy watching England v Croatia on a giant screen at Hyde Park with 29,999 others on Wednesday then you may want to enter this ballot here. “The game in Moscow, will be screened at 7pm on our enormous Great Oak Stage and will mark the biggest London screening of a football match since 1996!” cheer organisers. The top right corner off the website says tickets are on sale at 2pm but in the statement it says 4pm. So, either way, pretty soon. On the subject of World Cup managers who haven’t had club careers comparable to that of Luis Enrique’s, Paul Wilson has written a lovely feature on Roberto Martínez and Gareth Southgate, who have proved more at home amid the intensity of a short World Cup campaign than a Premier League slog. And did you know that Martínez still lives on the outskirts of Wigan? I didn’t. Well, not until I read this piece any way. Hello, Gregg here. Right, back to the news that Luis Enrique has taken the Spain job. The president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, has said that their new coach turned down better paid roles to take on the challenge of reinvigorating the national team. At first glance, it seems somewhat of a coup but then this World Cup has shown that managers who haven’t had stellar club careers can do just as well as those who have. Right, I’m going to pop away for a bit of luncheon. Gregg Bakowski will fill in. I leave you with an email: “Has anyone else noticed the parallels between Gareth’s boys and the all conquering England Rugby team of 2003?” wonders Duncan Watanabe. “Both teams, while perhaps not as pleasing to the eye as other sides, are/were extremely well-prepared, well-organised and well-drilled with new set play ideas and a well mannered hero who you can always depend on to slam home the penalties!” The BBC are showing the 1990 World Cup semi-final between England and West Germany in full online at the moment (if you’re in the UK you can watch it here). The most striking thing about what I’ve seen of it so far (the second half has just got under way) is the prevalence of the back-pass as an easy way of getting out of defensive difficulties. News just in: this sad-looking bear thinks Belgium are going to beat France, based on it doing something it didn’t understand. Official: Luis Enrique is the new coach of Spain: This, meanwhile, was the half-time entertainment at Xolos Tijuana in Mexico on Saturday, midway through a friendly against the Costa Rican side Herediano. It’s a “Neymar Challenge”, in which participants compete to see who can roll along the ground the greatest distance while screaming in pain (courtesy of FourFourTwo). It’s all happening in Spain, where a new head coach is expected to be announced this afternoon. This from Reuters: The Spanish Football Federation has appointed Jose Francisco Molina as Spain’s new sporting director but it has delayed naming a new national team coach until after it holds a board meeting later on Monday. The new head coach of Spain’s national team needed to be a person of strong character, President of Spain’s Football Federation Luis Rubiales said during a press conference. “What we are looking for is an undeniable leader in the dressing room, who sets a pattern and that no one deviates from that pattern, and that is the selection of the future we have devised,” Rubiales said, adding that an official announcement would be made this afternoon. Local media reported earlier on Monday that former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique will be the next national team coach. It must feel absolutely bizarre to be Gareth Southgate at the moment. England have held a behind-closed-doors training session, and are declaring that everybody is fit and well, though as we’ve discovered there is always the possibility that this is just disinformation, and in fact England’s last two fit players went to the cinema. This just in from the Corrigan Brothers, the people behind the Irish No24 hit, There’s No One as Irish as Barack Obama: The Irish band the Corrigan Brothers from Limerick are celebrating a fellow Limierck Man in song. The brothers who have played President Obama’s inauguration and charted all over the world with their multi million youtube hit “There’s no one as Irish as Barack Obama” are celebrating Limerick’s Harry Kane and have released “There’s no one as Irish as Harry Kane”. Ger Corrigan, lead singer with the band said: ‘We heard that Harry’s Grandmother Theresa Fitzgerald is from Caherline in Limerick and we felt we had to celebrate Harry. He is not the best striker that Limerick has ever produced, he is second to Des Kennedy, our Limerick Legend, the man who couldn’t stop scoring against Real Madrid in our great European Cup Campaign in 1980.’ The Corrigan Brothers look forward to performing the song for Harry when he brings the Golden Boot home to Limerick. Twelve years ago today: “While I don’t think that Mark Geiger of USA was baised, his performance in England vs Colombia wasn’t very assured,” writes Mike MacKenzie in Canada. “I’m surprised that he wasn’t sent home, especially with 12 refs still on hand.” I have to agree with this. I’d still be extremely surprised to see him back on the pitch in this tournament. So there are still 12 referees, and only four games left for them to officiate. The only referee to have taken charge of a knock-out game who has subsequently been sent home is Damir Skomina, whose officiating of Sweden 1-0 Switzerland obviously displeased somebody. Fifa have taken the pruning sheers to their referees’ list, and these are the officials that are still on it: AFC: Alireza Faghani (IRN) CAF: Malang Niedhiou (SEN) CONCACAF: Mark Geiger (USA); Cesar Arturo Ramos Palazuelos (MEX) CONMEBOL: Andres Cunha (URU); Nestor Pitana (ARG); Sandro Ricci (BRA) OFC: Matthew Conger (NZL) UEFA: Cuneyt Cakir (TUR); Bjorn Kuipers (NED); Milorad Mazic (SRB); Gianluca Rocchi (ITA) Video Assistant Referees CONMEBOL: Wilton Sampaio (BRA); Mauro Vigliano (ARG) UEFA: Bastian Dankert (GER); Artur Dias Soares (POR); Pawel Gil (POL), Massimiliano Irrati (ITA); Danny Makkelie (NED); Daniele Orsato (ITA); Paolo Valeri (ITA); Felix Zwayer (GER) And here’s Luka Modric on England, in which he refuses to tell us an interesting story about Harry Kane. “Harry was young and just coming up,” Modric said about his time at Tottenham. “He was always a hard worker. I actually remember one story about him but I will keep it to myself.” Here’s a piece on Jordan Henderson: Jordan Henderson limped away from the Samara Arena on Saturday evening offering up a few optimistic soundbites as he went. “It doesn’t feel too bad,” was swiftly followed up with “hopefully it’ll be fine”. But it says everything about the impact the Liverpool midfielder has made in Russia that the admission he had overstretched an already tight hamstring late on in the victory against Sweden instantly spread a sense of dread among his audience. Henderson, a figure who has rather divided opinion over the years, is established as this team’s heartbeat. More here: Colombia’s team doctor has admitted he lied about James Rodriguez’s injury, and says such misinformation is “part of the game”. I report this without judgement: I think he’s right, and in a similar position would say pretty much anything that seemed useful: On the subject of Russian cuisine, here’s a mouthwatering picture of Barney Ronay’s breakfast buffet yesterday: In the absence of actual football to report on, Reuters have sent over a piece about Russian food: Many soccer fans knew little or nothing about Russian cuisine before the World Cup, but have tucked into local gastronomy with relish, trying everything from luxurious caviar to staples like veal tongue. Russian food is often thought of as bland and heavy, and indeed many dishes seem geared towards getting people through the gruelling winter rather than amusing their palates. But 28 year-old Egyptian Ahmed Morsy has made it a point of trying a new Russian dish every day. Meat-filled pelmeni dumplings and Beef stroganoff rank among his favourites. “I love it, honestly. It’s better than I expected. I don’t like spicy food myself so for me it was perfect,” said Morsy as he perused a restaurant menu in the sweltering southern city of Volgograd. “The whole country has exceeded my expectations. I had never been to Russia before, I thought the people would be grumpy and the country not that organised,” he said. Indeed, most fans have been impressed by Russians - some in remote or industrial towns where tourists rarely tread - bending over backwards to help, dispelling preconceptions and spreading an upbeat atmosphere. “I thought Russian food might be weird. I haven’t found it weird. But I do prefer the Uzbek and Azerbaijani barbecue,” said Morsy’s university pal Mamdooh El Eleila, 29, who ordered Kiev chicken, a fillet that is either fried or baked. Indeed, food from nearby countries - particularly spicier Georgian cuisine - has been particularly popular with fans looking for a little more piquancy in their plates. Caviar bars and vodka cocktails have also been prized. Still, some fans from countries like India and Mexico, renowned for their succulent spicy fare, have not been impressed. “The flavours here are quite salty. And of course we miss chili,” said Ricardo Garcia, a 32 year-old programmer decked out in the green Mexican football jersey. “We brought hot sauce with us from Mexico but we forgot it in our last hostel and now were suffering a little. We found some ketchup with chili in a supermarket and that helps a little, but it’s not the same.” His pal Heriberto Gonzalez, however, was far more upbeat. “There are some soups that any Mexican mothers could prepare! Borscht, for example, because they use the potato in a very similar way. Of course, there’s a little bitter Russian flavour to it,” said Gonzalez, a 37 year-old who works in marketing. “But if I wanted Mexican food, I would have stayed in Mexico!” Some fans, however, have found temporary refuge in their own cuisine - like Egyptian physics student Ahmed Nasr, who was queuing for a shawarma. But he said local waiters and chefs had also prodded him - via Google Translate - to try local fares including Russian lamb and buckwheat. “I was at a buffet and the staff encouraged me to try Russian food. I liked it. I did not even know what they ate in Russia,” said Nasr, 31, who lives in Canada. “In Canada we have Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern food, but I’ve never seen Russian. Maybe I will look for a Russian restaurant - hopefully I can find one!” he laughed. And also, potentially vital celebratory pile-up training. Every base covered: “Getting exciting, isn’t it!” writes Will Hargreaves. Well, I’d say it was exciting from the beginning, but has now become tense and nervous and a little bit surreal. “That acknowledged, I don’t think that Snr Martinez has actually wet himself. I think that striding across the middle of the sprinkler avoids this occurrence. Another piece of tactical genius from the Belgium leader.” Well, perhaps. I thought perhaps he’d misjudged it, as one of two streams of water coming out of the sprinkler appeared to end in his groinal area. Here, though, is something else that the Belgians have been working on in training: ball-levitation: This article in the New York Times about the bizarre circus that is the World Cup press conference is very good. There will be no ban, so long as he doesn’t repeat the offence: Fifa yesterday said their disciplinary committee had “sent a warning to the player Domagoj Vida due to his video statement following the 2018 Fifa World Cup match between Russia and Croatia”, which is as far as they are going to go for now. Belgium have been training already today, a session in which Roberto Martinez appears to have quite deliberately wet himself. There’s not a lot of official World Cup activity scheduled today, but this is what I’ve got (all times BST): 1.30pm England “media opportunity”. I don’t know if this is a full-blown press conference or simply a game of darts. 2.45pm France will hold a press conference in St Petersburg, featuring Didier Deschamps and Hugo Lloris. 4pm Croatia hold a press conference in Moscow. 5pm Belgium hold a press conference in St Petersburg, with Roberto Martinez and Kevin de Bruyne involved. Andy Perkins has come up with perhaps the definitive response to Naaman’s earlier call for a proposed list of England penalty takers: “My five penalty takers for England. Kane, Rashford/Vardy, Trippier, Young, Maguire with his head.” England’s official twitter account has recycled some old photos to mark Ashley Young’s birthday. They’d probably have liked to do something a bit more special, but are busy baking. Though while the World Cup was on there was also this giant cake and near-lifesize chocolate Messi: The World Cup cake bar was raised just a few days ago, when someone at Croatia’s team hotel baked this for Dejan Lovren: It is Ashley Young’s birthday today. I wonder what’s planned for him at the England camp. An awkward cake-cutting photo opportunity at the very least, I’d wager. I notice the Wikipedia page on Winchester has been updated to reflect someone’s strange fantasy that emerged from the fact that Ousmane Dembélé started a Football Manager game as manager of Winchester FC during this World Cup: Winchester has Winchester City F.C. who currently play in the Southern League and Winchester Castle F.C., who have played in the Hampshire League since 1971. The local Saturday football league, the Winchester &amp; District League, folded in 2010. After France’s crushing victory over England in the 2018 World Cup Final (10-0), Ousmane Dembele was appointed manager, with the intention of bringing a Southern American atmosphere to the club. Hello world! Simon Burnton here, taking over for the next, well, while. I start with more news on Belgium’s team quiz. This is a pretty hard photo round, in my opinion. How many faces can you put names to? And with that, I’ll be handing over to my colleague Simon Burnton. Thanks for reading along, roasting managers, and joining me as we wait for the football to start (but hopefully, never end). Goalkeeping kit disaster! George Garrett writes: “Disaster! Forget the white, the tweet said YELLOW goalkeeper shirts. Which is what Paul Robinson was wearing when Gary Neville’s pass-back bobbled over his foot in Zagreb in 2006 and what Scott Carson was wearing when Steve McClaren wanted shelter from the rain a year later. Terrible omen!” The Guardian’s own Priya Ramesh has also made this point, and far better than I have. It’s not news that black players are always analysed and described in the vocabulary of brawn a little more than brain. But it remains something to keep an eye on, in my opinion. Romelu Lukaku is smart. We need to talking about it more. Too often the analysis boils down to the cliches of power and pace, but the evidence is before us. That run really is a thing of beauty, and a lesson in intelligence, quick wit and movement. In Russia, the Belgian striker has consistently excelled in his build-up play. It’s been a tournament for appreciating strikers’ off-the-ball work – Giroud, Griezemann, Firmino etc. – and it’s time Lukaku got the acclaim too. He’s nabbed the goals, made the runs and his passing, especially to De Bruyne for that lethal stab against Brazil, has been spot on. I’ve just been informed that Round 4 of the Belgian team’s trivia night is probably about past goals of the tournament. Answer no.3, Saeed Al-Owairan, is remembered for this effort from USA 1994. Could the question have been about best goals scored against Belgium? In a spot of non-World Cup transfer news, Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped what seems to be another hint at the Juventus transfer rumours swirling around. Also Paulinho’s headed back to Guangzhou Evergrande after a fairly successful season at Barcelona. Ok. Ok some tactics. This is required reading for any England fan. A breakdown of that super-effective, Lincoln City-inspired corner routine that brought Maguire’s opener against Sweden. Click through for the rest! The Belgian team are playing trivia. I 100%, unironically would love to watch that. You can see the answers in the fourth photo, from which I am trying to reverse-engineer the questions. Round 1: Name all the Germans who scored in the 7-1 defeat of Brazil? Round 3: Which stadiums and cities hosted the 2010 and 1998 finals? Can anyone else shed some light? Step forward José Pékerman – or rather, don’t. KevBod has a great shout for the Colombian coach as Worst Dressed Manager. Far out, this is spot on. Look at this unflattering photo I picked out from the exit to England. He looks like a toy soldier stuck on a hotplate – plastic all pooling down to his feet. More roasts: Crucial kit news. Sound the klaxon, England will face Croatia in all-white. I’m seeing a mixed response in the replies. The dreamers say it’s a good omen – England wore white in the semi in 1966, then went and won the thing in red. But the away strip has the stats behind it. England are on an eight-year unbeaten streak in red, with 9 wins and 8 draws since losing to Germany in South Africa. Folks this is gonna decide it all! Ah Tony06, I’m with you there. I guarantee I haven’t forgotten Aliou Cissé. Still my pick for the coolest manager, gutted that he and his team went home so early, and definitely a sex symbol. He trumps Sir Gareth for style icon in my opinion. She said yes! Congrats Bozza and Sara. Here’s today’s plan for Belgium: I don’t quite get the activity listed for 8.30 though. Physio, games and squad bonding? Any suggestions? Oi everyone in the comments – fewer Brexit jokes and more submissions for Worst Dressed Manager please. Here’s the man to beat: And if you’re into the 28 club curse... Then don’t pick: Ashley Young (32), Gary Cahill (32), Jamie Vardy (31), Fabian Delph (28), Kyle Walker (28) or Danny Rose, who turned 28 just last Monday. At 19, Trent Alexander-Arnold is the youngest in the squad. Give him a go Gareth! The 28 club and Jordan Henderson. I’ve seen this stat doing the rounds, that the only England player to miss a penalty against Colombia was over 28. Kane (24), Rashford (20), Trippier (27) and Dier (24) all put them away – unburdened via youth of England’s past penalty horror. Hendo, who just turned 28 on the 17th of June, had a pretty good effort saved. This is just a roundabout way of asking – if it comes down to it again – who do you want taking the penalties? Send me through your first 5. Yep, what a World Cup. It’s fair to say hopes are high for Belgium v France. Neighbours, rivals, two fantastically talented attacking squads. And in the middle of it all, Thierry Henry. His influence on this Belgium team has given an already mouthwatering clash extra spice. Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp.” He’s got no goals, but Giroud could Guivarc’h (I’m using it as a verb) France past Belgium and beyond, writes Stuart James. While Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann enjoy the limelight Giroud is quietly going about his business, out of the race for the Golden Boot but well in the running for a World Cup winner’s medal. Left out of the starting XI for the opening game, Giroud has selflessly played the role of target man since, giving Mbappé and Griezmann the freedom to flourish. Here’s how England’s players are spending their rest days. I have the exact same set up going now in the Guardian’s Sydney office. Me and Mike Hytner are recreating this as we speak. Belgium to win it all, England to lose the final, and France and Croatia out in the semis. Well that’s what the latest power rankings say. Read on: Nakul Bhagwat writes in with the first email. And it’s a cracker. “Long time reader, first time writer,” he begins. “Sir Gareth seems to be the consensus choice for best dressed manager at this year’s World Cup. Who was the worst dressed? My nomination is Jorge Sampaoli with his slightly too tight t-shirts, which (fittingly) seemed to be buckling under the pressure.” Great pick, Nakul. I’ll say Joachim Löw. Eight years ago, I thought his wavy fringe and European v-neck were a breath of fresh air. But there was something about this year’s number, a thin blue t-shirt, that seemed to be tight in all the wrong places. And yes, the comments were off there for about 20 minutes, but they’re back now! Sound off below the line – who can take Sampaoli’s ill-fitting crown? Er...congratulations Bozza? Mark Bosnich, who is now plying his trade as a pundit for Fox Sports Australia, has just proposed to his partner. Via selfie cam. From Russia. With the wind all rattling in the speaker. Hope she says yes. Spain news: Luis Enrique is the national team’s new manager. It’s in all the papers and leading all the radio bulletins. It will be officially announced, by bigwig Luis Rubiales no doubt, later today. But it looks a done deal. The former Barcelona coach will be appointed permanently now that Fernando Hierro’s rather unsuccessful caretaker stint is over. Enrique, who won the 2015 Champions League with that fearsome trident of Messi, Neymar and Suarez, has been on sabbatical since he left the Nou Camp in May last year. In the eighth episode of the Simpsons’s fourth season (New Kid on the Block), Bart falls in love. Stay with me here. He’s so happy when Laura Powers, the object of his affection, touches his hand that he doesn’t wash it for days, trying to prolong that moment for as long as he can. Well this is my attempt – in vain of course – to do the same for this World Cup. I’ll say it. I don’t want it to end. If it would give us another week, another round, I’d never wash these liveblogging fingers again. But it doesn’t work like that. We are rocketing towards the end, everything converging inwards. The absolute tragedy of competition is this horrible exponential sense of footballing decay. Four matches left. How? After Saturday, one. So I’m grateful, more than you can believe, for today. This blog is another day to discuss, theorise, to imagine all those classic clashes-in-waiting before the reality hits – of a grim 0-0 in one, a match-ending Mario Mandžukić deflection in the other, and the end. This might only be a rest day, but that’s another day when this isn’t over yet. England are already in dreamland. Croatia and Belgium? They are too. Let’s try and stay there, at least a little while longer. Email me at naaman.zhou@theguardian.com, and tweet me at @naamanzhou. Or as always, comment below the line. Let’s keep this going."

          "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin was not in attendance, but his loyal lieutenants were. On 14 July last year, the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and several members of his cabinet convened in an office building on the outskirts of Moscow. On to the stage stepped a boyish-looking psychologist, Michal Kosinski, who had been flown from the city centre by helicopter to share his research. “There was Lavrov, in the first row,” he recalls several months later, referring to Russia’s foreign minister. “You know, a guy who starts wars and takes over countries.” Kosinski, a 36-year-old assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Stanford University, was flattered that the Russian cabinet would gather to listen to him talk. “Those guys strike me as one of the most competent and well-informed groups,” he tells me. “They did their homework. They read my stuff.” Kosinski’s “stuff” includes groundbreaking research into technology, mass persuasion and artificial intelligence (AI) – research that inspired the creation of the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Five years ago, while a graduate student at Cambridge University, he showed how even benign activity on Facebook could reveal personality traits – a discovery that was later exploited by the data-analytics firm that helped put Donald Trump in the White House. That would be enough to make Kosinski interesting to the Russian cabinet. But his audience would also have been intrigued by his work on the use of AI to detect psychological traits. Weeks after his trip to Moscow, Kosinski published a controversial paper in which he showed how face-analysing algorithms could distinguish between photographs of gay and straight people. As well as sexuality, he believes this technology could be used to detect emotions, IQ and even a predisposition to commit certain crimes. Kosinski has also used algorithms to distinguish between the faces of Republicans and Democrats, in an unpublished experiment he says was successful – although he admits the results can change “depending on whether I include beards or not”. How did this 36-year-old academic, who has yet to write a book, attract the attention of the Russian cabinet? Over our several meetings in California and London, Kosinski styles himself as a taboo-busting thinker, someone who is prepared to delve into difficult territory concerning artificial intelligence and surveillance that other academics won’t. “I can be upset about us losing privacy,” he says. “But it won’t change the fact that we already lost our privacy, and there’s no going back without destroying this civilisation.” The aim of his research, Kosinski says, is to highlight the dangers. Yet he is strikingly enthusiastic about some of the technologies he claims to be warning us about, talking excitedly about cameras that could detect people who are “lost, anxious, trafficked or potentially dangerous. You could imagine having those diagnostic tools monitoring public spaces for potential threats to themselves or to others,” he tells me. “There are different privacy issues with each of those approaches, but it can literally save lives.” “Progress always makes people uncomfortable,” Kosinski adds. “Always has. Probably, when the first monkeys stopped hanging from the trees and started walking on the savannah, the monkeys in the trees were like, ‘This is outrageous! It makes us uncomfortable.’ It’s the same with any new technology.” *** Kosinski has analysed thousands of people’s faces, but never run his own image through his personality-detecting models, so we cannot know what traits are indicated by his pale-grey eyes or the dimple in his chin. I ask him to describe his own personality. He says he’s a conscientious, extroverted and probably emotional person with an IQ that is “perhaps slightly above average.” He adds: “And I’m disagreeable.” What made him that way? “If you trust personality science, it seems that, to a large extent, you’re born this way.” His friends, on the other hand, describe Kosinski as a brilliant, provocative and irrepressible data scientist who has an insatiable (some say naive) desire to push the boundaries of his research. “Michal is like a small boy with a hammer,” one of his academic friends tells me. “Suddenly everything looks like a nail.” Born in 1982 in Warsaw, Kosinski inherited his aptitude for coding from his parents, both of whom trained as software engineers. Kosinski and his brother and sister had “a computer at home, potentially much earlier than western people of the same age”. By the late 1990s, as Poland’s post-Soviet economy was opening up, Kosinski was hiring his schoolmates to work for his own IT company. This business helped fund him through university, and in 2008 he enrolled in a PhD programme at Cambridge, where he was affiliated with the Psychometrics Centre, a facility specialising in measuring psychological traits. It was around that time that he met David Stillwell, another graduate student, who had built a personality quiz and shared it with friends on Facebook. The app quickly went viral, as hundreds and then thousands of people took the survey to discover their scores according to the “Big Five” metrics: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. When users completed the myPersonality tests, some of which also measured IQ and wellbeing, they were given an option to donate their results to academic research. Kosinski came on board, using his digital skills to clean, anonymise and sort the data, and then make it available to other academics. By 2012, more than 6 million people had taken the tests – with about 40% donating their data, creating the largest dataset of its kind. In May, New Scientist magazine revealed that the dataset’s username and password had been accidentally left on GitHub, a commonly used code-sharing website. For four years, anyone – not just authorised researchers – could have accessed the data. Before the magazine’s investigation, Kosinski had admitted to me that there were risks to their liberal approach. “We anonymised the data, and we made scientists sign a guarantee that they will not use it for any commercial reasons,” he had said. “But you just can’t really guarantee that this will not happen.” Much of the Facebook data, he added, was “de-anonymisable”. In the wake of the New Scientist story, Stillwell closed down the myPersonality project. Kosinski sent me a link to the announcement, complaining: “Twitter warriors and sensation-seeking writers made David shut down the myPersonality project.” During the time the myPersonalitydata was accessible, about 280 researchers used it to publish more than 100 academic papers. The most talked-about was a 2013 study co-authored by Kosinski, Stillwell and another researcher, that explored the relationship between Facebook “Likes” and the psychological and demographic traits of 58,000 people. Some of the results were intuitive: the best predictors of introversion, for example, were Likes for pages such as “Video Games” and “Voltaire”. Other findings were more perplexing: among the best predictors of high IQ were Likes on the Facebook pages for “Thunderstorms” and “Morgan Freeman’s Voice”. People who Liked pages for “iPod” and “Gorillaz” were likely to be dissatisfied with life. If an algorithm was fed with sufficient data about Facebook Likes, Kosinski and his colleagues found, it could make more accurate personality-based predictions than assessments made by real-life friends. In other research, Kosinski and others showed how Facebook data could be turned into what they described as “an effective approach to digital mass persuasion”. Their research came to the attention of the SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In 2014, SCL tried to enlist Stillwell and Kosinski, offering to buy the myPersonality data and their predictive models. When negotiations broke down, they relied on the help of another academic in Cambridge’s psychology department – Aleksandr Kogan, an assistant professor. Using his own Facebook personality quiz, and paying users (with SCL money) to take the tests, Kogan collected data on 320,000 Americans. Exploiting a loophole that allowed developers to harvest data belonging to the friends of Facebook app users (without their knowledge or consent), Kogan was able to hoover up additional data on as many as 87 million people. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who lifted the lid on Cambridge Analytica’s operations earlier this year, has described how the company set out to “replicate” the work done by Kosinski and his colleagues, and to turn it into an instrument of “psychological warfare”. “This is not my fault,” Kosinski told reporters from the Swiss publication Das Magazin, which was the first to make the connection between his work and Cambridge Analytica. “I did not build the bomb. I only showed that it exists.” Cambridge Analytica always denied using Facebook-based psychographic targeting during the Trump campaign, but the scandal over its data harvesting forced the company to close. The saga also proved highly damaging to Facebook, whose headquarters are less than four miles from Kosinski’s base at Stanford’s Business School in Silicon Valley. The first time I enter his office, I ask him about a painting beside his computer, depicting a protester armed with a Facebook logo in a holster instead of a gun. “People think I’m anti-Facebook,” Kosinski says. “But I think that, generally, it is just a wonderful technology”. Still, he is disappointed in the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who, when he testified before US Congress in April, said he was trying to find out “whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University”. Facebook, Kosinski says, was well aware of his research. He shows me emails he had with employees in 2011, in which they disclosed they were “using analysis of linguistic data to infer personality traits”. In 2012, the same employees filed a patent, showing how personality characteristics could be gleaned from Facebook messages and status updates. Kosinski seems unperturbed by the furore over Cambridge Analytica, which he feels has unfairly maligned psychometric micro-targeting in politics. “There are negative aspects to it, but overall this is a great technology and great for democracy,” he says. “If you can target political messages to fit people’s interests, dreams, personality, you make those messages more relevant, which makes voters more engaged – and more engaged voters are great for democracy.” But you can also, I say, use those same techniques to discourage your opponent’s voters from turning out, which is bad for democracy. “Then every politician in the US is doing this,” Kosinski replies, with a shrug. “Whenever you target the voters of your opponent, this is a voter-suppression activity.” Kosinski’s wider complaint about the Cambridge Analytica fallout, he says, is that it has created “an illusion” that governments can protect data and shore up their citizens’ privacy. “It is a lost war,” he says. “We should focus on organising our society in such a way as to make sure that the post-privacy era is a habitable and nice place to live.” *** Kosinski says he never set out to prove that AI could predict a person’s sexuality. He describes it as a chance discovery, something he “stumbled upon”. The lightbulb moment came as he was sifting through Facebook profiles for another project and started to notice what he thought were patterns in people’s faces. “It suddenly struck me,” he says, “introverts and extroverts have completely different faces. I was like, ‘Wow, maybe there’s something there.’” Physiognomy, the practice of determining a person’s character from their face, has a history that stretches back to ancient Greece. But its heyday came in the 19th century, when the Italian anthropologist Cesare Lombroso published his famous taxonomy, which declared that “nearly all criminals” have “jug ears, thick hair, thin beards, pronounced sinuses, protruding chins, and broad cheekbones”. The analysis was rooted in a deeply racist school of thought that held that criminals resembled “savages and apes”, although Lombroso presented his findings with the precision of a forensic scientist. Thieves were notable for their “small wandering eyes”, rapists their “swollen lips and eyelids”, while murderers had a nose that was “often hawklike and always large”. Lombroso’s remains are still on display in a museum in Turin, besides the skulls of the hundreds of criminals he spent decades examining. Where Lombroso used calipers and craniographs, Kosinski has been using neural networks to find patterns in photos scraped from the internet. Kosinski’s research dismisses physiognomy as “a mix of superstition and racism disguised as science” – but then argues it created a taboo around “studying or even discussing the links between facial features and character”. There is growing evidence, he insists, that links between faces and psychology exist, even if they are invisible to the human eye; now, with advances in machine learning, such links can be perceived. “We didn’t have algorithms 50 years ago that could spot patterns,” he says. “We only had human judges.” In a paper published last year, Kosinski and a Stanford computer scientist, Yilun Wang, reported that a machine-learning system was able to distinguish between photos of gay and straight people with a high degree of accuracy. They used 35,326 photographs from dating websites and what Kosinski describes as “off-the-shelf” facial-recognition software. Presented with two pictures – one of a gay person, the other straight – the algorithm was trained to distinguish the two in 81% of cases involving images of men and 74% of photographs of women. Human judges, by contrast, were able to identify the straight and gay people in 61% and 54% of cases, respectively. When the algorithm was shown five facial images per person in the pair, its accuracy increased to 91% for men, 83% for women. “I was just shocked to discover that it is so easy for an algorithm to distinguish between gay and straight people,” Kosinski tells me. “I didn’t see why that would be possible.” Neither did many other people, and there was an immediate backlash when the research – dubbed “AI gaydar” – was previewed in the Economist magazine. Two of America’s most prominent LGBTQ organisations demanded that Stanford distance itself from what they called its professor’s “dangerous and flawed research”. Kosinski received a deluge of emails, many from people who told him they were confused about their sexuality and hoped he would run their photo through his algorithm. (He declined.) There was also anger that Kosinski had conducted research on a technology that could be used to persecute gay people in countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is punishable by death. Kosinski says his critics missed the point. “This is the inherent paradox of warning people against potentially dangerous technology,” he says. “I stumbled upon those results, and I was actually close to putting them in a drawer and not publishing – because I had a very good life without this paper being out. But then a colleague asked me if I would be able to look myself in the mirror if, one day, a company or a government deployed a similar technique to hurt people.” It would, he says, have been “morally wrong” to bury his findings. One vocal critic of that defence is the Princeton professor Alexander Todorov, who has conducted some of the most widely cited research into faces and psychology. He argues that Kosinski’s methods are deeply flawed: the patterns picked up by algorithms comparing thousands of photographs may have little to do with facial characteristics. In a mocking critique posted online, Todorov and two AI researchers at Google argued that Kosinski’s algorithm could have been responding to patterns in people’s makeup, beards or glasses, even the angle they held the camera at. Self-posted photos on dating websites, Todorov points out, project a number of non-facial clues. Kosinski acknowledges that his machine learning system detects unrelated signals, but is adamant the software also distinguishes between facial structures. His findings are consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, he says, which argues that the levels of androgens foetuses are exposed to in the womb help determine whether people are straight or gay. The same androgens, Kosinski argues, could also result in “gender-atypical facial morphology”. “Thus,” he writes in his paper, “gay men are predicted to have smaller jaws and chins, slimmer eyebrows, longer noses and larger foreheads... The opposite should be true for lesbians.” This is where Kosinski’s work strays into biological determinism. While he does not deny the influence of social and environmental factors on our personalities, he plays them down. At times, what he says seems eerily reminiscent of Lombroso, who was critical of the idea that criminals had “free will”: they should be pitied rather than punished, the Italian argued, because – like monkeys, cats and cuckoos – they were “programmed to do harm”. “I don’t believe in guilt, because I don’t believe in free will,” Kosinski tells me, explaining that a person’s thoughts and behaviour “are fully biological, because they originate in the biological computer that you have in your head”. On another occasion he tells me, “If you basically accept that we’re just computers, then computers are not guilty of crime. Computers can malfunction. But then you shouldn’t blame them for it.” The professor adds: “Very much like: you don’t, generally, blame dogs for misbehaving.” Todorov believes Kosinski’s research is “incredibly ethically questionable”, as it could lend a veneer of credibility to governments that might want to use such technologies. He points to a paper that appeared online two years ago, in which Chinese AI researchers claimed they had trained a face-recognition algorithm to predict – with 90% accuracy – whether someone was a convicted criminal. The research, which used Chinese government identity photographs of hundreds of male criminals, was not peer-reviewed, and was torn to shreds by Todorov, who warned that “developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled scientific racism to enter a new era”. Kosinski has a different take. “The fact that the results were completely invalid and unfounded, doesn’t mean that what they propose is also wrong,” he says. “I can’t see why you would not be able to predict the propensity to commit a crime from someone’s face. We know, for instance, that testosterone levels are linked to the propensity to commit crime, and they’re also linked with facial features – and this is just one link. There are thousands or millions of others that we are unaware of, that computers could very easily detect.” Would he ever undertake similar research? Kosinski hesitates, saying that “crime” is an overly blunt label. It would be more sensible, he says, to “look at whether we can detect traits or predispositions that are potentially dangerous to an individual or society – like aggressive behaviour”. He adds: “I think someone has to do it… Because if this is a risky technology, then governments and corporations are clearly already using it.” *** But when I press Kosinski for examples of how psychology-detecting AI is being used by governments, he repeatedly falls back on an obscure Israeli startup, Faception. The company provides software that scans passports, visas and social-media profiles, before spitting out scores that categorise people according to several personality types. On its website, Faception lists eight such classifiers, including “White-Collar Offender”, “High IQ”, “Paedophile” and “Terrorist”. Kosinski describes the company as “dodgy” – a case study in why researchers who care about privacy should alert the public to the risks of AI. “Check what Faception are doing and what clients they have,” he tells me during an animated debate over the ethics of his research. I call Faception’s chief executive, Shai Gilboa, who used to work in Israeli military intelligence. He tells me the company has contracts working on “homeland security and public safety” in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. To my surprise, he then tells me about a research collaboration he conducted two years ago. “When you look in the academia market you’re looking for the best researchers, who have very good databases and vast experience,” he says. “So this is the reason we approached Professor Kosinski.” But when I put this connection to Kosinski, he plays it down: he claims to have met Faception to discuss the ethics of facial-recognition technologies. “They came [to Stanford] because they realised what they are doing has potentially huge negative implications, and huge risks.” Later, he concedes there was more to it. He met them “maybe three times” in Silicon Valley, and was offered equity in the company in exchange for becoming an adviser (he says he declined). Kosinski denies having collaborated on research, but admits Faception gave him access to its facial-recognition software. He experimented with Facebook photos in the myPersonality dataset, he says, to determine how effective the Faception software was at detecting personality traits. He then suggested Gilboa talk to Stillwell about purchasing the myPersonality data. (Stillwell, Kosinski says, declined.) He bristles at my suggestion that these conversations seem ethically dubious. “I will do a lot of this,” he says. “A lot of startup people come here and they don’t offer you any money, but they say, ‘Look, we have this project, can you advise us?’” Turning down such a request would have made him “an arrogant prick”. He gives a similar explanation for his trip to Moscow, which he says was arranged by Sberbank Corporate University as an “educational day” for Russian government officials. The university is a subsidiary of Sberbank, a state-owned bank sanctioned by the EU; its chief executive, Russia’s former minister for economic development, is close to Putin. What was the purpose of the trip? “I didn’t really understand the context,” says Kosinski. “They put me on a helicopter, flew me to a place, I came on the stage. On the helicopter I was given a briefing about who was going to be in the room. Then I gave a talk, and we talked about how AI is changing society. And then they sent me off.” The last time I see Kosinski, we meet in London. He becomes prickly when I press him on Russia, pointing to its dire record on gay rights. Did he talk about using facial-recognition technology to detect sexuality? Yes, he says – but this talk was no different from other presentations in which he discussed the same research. (A couple of days later, Kosinski tells me he has checked his slides; in fact, he says, he didn’t tell the Russians about his “AI gaydar”.) Who else was in the audience, aside from Medvedev and Lavrov? Kosinski doesn’t know. Is it possible he was talking to a room full of Russian intelligence operatives? “That’s correct,” he says. “But I think that people who work for the surveillance state, more than anyone, deserve to know that what they are doing is creating real risk.” He tells me he is no fan of Russia, and stresses there was no discussion of spying or influencing elections. “As an academic, you have a duty to try to counter bad ideas and spread good ideas,” he says, adding that he would talk to “the most despicable dictator out there”. I ask Kosinski if anyone has tried to recruit him as an intelligence asset. He hedges. “Do you think that if an intelligence agency approaches you they say: ‘Hi, I’m the CIA’?” he replies. “No, they say, ‘Hi, I’m a startup, and I’m interested in your work – would you be an adviser?’ That definitely happened in the UK. When I was at Cambridge, I had a minder.” He tells me about a British defence expert he suspected worked for the intelligence services who took a keen interest in his research, inviting him to seminars attended by officials in military uniforms. In one of our final conversations, Kosinski tells me he shouldn’t have talked about his visit to Moscow, because his hosts asked him not to. It would not be “elegant” to mention it in the Guardian, he says, and besides, “it is an irrelevant fact”. I point out that he already left a fairly big clue on Facebook, where he posted an image of himself onboard a helicopter with the caption: “Taking off to give a talk for Prime Minister Medvedev.” He later changed his privacy settings: the photo was no longer public, but for “friends only”. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

          "bodyText": "It’s hard to build a service powered by artificial intelligence. So hard, in fact, that some startups have worked out it’s cheaper and easier to get humans to behave like robots than it is to get machines to behave like humans. “Using a human to do the job lets you skip over a load of technical and business development challenges. It doesn’t scale, obviously, but it allows you to build something and skip the hard part early on,” said Gregory Koberger, CEO of ReadMe, who says he has come across a lot of “pseudo-AIs”. “It’s essentially prototyping the AI with human beings,” he said. This practice was brought to the fore this week in a Wall Street Journal article highlighting the hundreds of third-party app developers that Google allows to access people’s inboxes. In the case of the San Jose-based company Edison Software, artificial intelligence engineers went through the personal email messages of hundreds of users – with their identities redacted – to improve a “smart replies” feature. The company did not mention that humans would view users’ emails in its privacy policy. The third parties highlighted in the WSJ article are far from the first ones to do it. In 2008, Spinvox, a company that converted voicemails into text messages, was accused of using humans in overseas call centres rather than machines to do its work. In 2016, Bloomberg highlighted the plight of the humans spending 12 hours a day pretending to be chatbots for calendar scheduling services such as X.ai and Clara. The job was so mind-numbing that human employees said they were looking forward to being replaced by bots. In 2017, the business expense management app Expensify admitted that it had been using humans to transcribe at least some of the receipts it claimed to process using its “smartscan technology”. Scans of the receipts were being posted to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourced labour tool, where low-paid workers were reading and transcribing them. “I wonder if Expensify SmartScan users know MTurk workers enter their receipts,” said Rochelle LaPlante, a “Turker” and advocate for gig economy workers on Twitter. “I’m looking at someone’s Uber receipt with their full name, pick-up and drop-off addresses.” Even Facebook, which has invested heavily in AI, relied on humans for its virtual assistant for Messenger, M. In some cases, humans are used to train the AI system and improve its accuracy. A company called Scale offers a bank of human workers to provide training data for self-driving cars and other AI-powered systems. “Scalers” will, for example, look at camera or sensor feeds and label cars, pedestrians and cyclists in the frame. With enough of this human calibration, the AI will learn to recognise these objects itself. In other cases, companies fake it until they make it, telling investors and users they have developed a scalable AI technology while secretly relying on human intelligence. Alison Darcy, a psychologist and founder of Woebot, a mental health support chatbot, describes this as the “Wizard of Oz design technique”. “You simulate what the ultimate experience of something is going to be. And a lot of time when it comes to AI, there is a person behind the curtain rather than an algorithm,” she said, adding that building a good AI system required a “ton of data” and that sometimes designers wanted to know if there was sufficient demand for a service before making the investment. This approach was not appropriate in the case of a psychological support service like Woebot, she said. “As psychologists we are guided by a code of ethics. Not deceiving people is very clearly one of those ethical principles.” Research has shown that people tend to disclose more when they think they are talking to a machine, rather than a person, because of the stigma associated with seeking help for one’s mental health. A team from the University of Southern California tested this with a virtual therapist called Ellie. They found that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to divulge their symptoms when they knew that Ellie was an AI system versus when they were told there was a human operating the machine. Others think companies should always be transparent about how their services operate. “I don’t like it,” said LaPlante of companies that pretend to offer AI-powered services but actually employ humans. “It feels dishonest and deceptive to me, neither of which is something I’d want from a business I’m using. “And on the worker side, it feels like we’re being pushed behind a curtain. I don’t like my labour being used by a company that will turn around and lie to their customers about what’s really happening.” This ethical quandary also raises its head with AI systems that pretend to be human. One recent example of this is Google Duplex, a robot assistant that makes eerily lifelike phone calls complete with “ums” and “ers” to book appointments and make reservations. After an initial backlash, Google said its AI would identify itself to the humans it spoke to. “In their demo version, it feels marginally deceptive in a low-impact conversation,” said Darcy. Although booking a table at a restaurant might seem like a low-stakes interaction, the same technology could be much more manipulative in the wrong hands. What would happen if you could make lifelike calls simulating the voice of a celebrity or politician, for example? “There’s already major fear around AI and it’s not really helping the conversation when there’s a lack of transparency,” Darcy said.

          "headline": "Another PMQs brings the end of days closer for Theresa May",
          "bodyText": "We are reaching the end of days. Theresa May’s authority diminishes by the day. Her cabinet is barely speaking to one another and body bags have been ordered in for Friday’s Chequers mini-break. Esther McVey has been accused of deliberately misleading parliament about Universal Credit by the National Audit Office. Vote Leave has been accused of breaking the electoral rules on campaign spending. And Jeremy Corbyn is asking questions about buses. Six of them. You wait for one question about buses… Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with using prime minister’s questions to wrong-foot May over buses. A large number of people depend on public transport to get around and bus services have become increasingly unreliable in many areas. Maybe, though, just one or two questions would have been enough. Then move on to trains, if you like. Chris Grayling’s job is hanging by a thread over his mishandling of the railways. But once you’ve done all that, just don’t forget to mention the war. As a general rule of thumb, a leader of the opposition is best off asking the questions a prime minister least wants to answer. And May is very happy not answering questions about buses. She doesn’t know anything about buses and she doesn’t care about buses because none of her MPs are giving her a hard time about buses. Tory voters, by and large, travel by car. The first question about buses received an answer about the NHS. May was only trying to be helpful. She didn’t have anything to say about buses but she knew she had to say something and she hoped the NHS would do. It wouldn’t. Corbyn pressed her again. The prime minister shrugged. She hadn’t a clue about local bus services in Cornwall. Were they the ones with £350m pasted on the side? Corbyn then went for a quick-fire round. The number 38 service in Greater Manchester. How many buses an hour? Pass. How many people had died because they couldn’t get to hospital? Pass. By the end, May looked positively cheerful. She’d come to PMQs expecting to be given a hard time. Public services falling apart were a breeze compared to the government falling apart. It took Owen Paterson, one of the hardline Brexiters in her own party, to ask the question she really didn’t want to answer. Would she sack any member of her cabinet who dared to propose a soft Brexit, and could she commit to keeping her election promise of bankrupting the country by leaving the single market and the customs union? May looked temporarily panicked and closed her eyes in fright. Hoping that when she reopened them, Paterson would have disappeared. But then she remembered there was no promise she had ever made that she hadn’t subsequently broken. So she might as well make another promise that she would break and tell him exactly what he wanted to hear. Maybot is as Maybot does. We’d definitely be leaving the single market and the customs union apart from the bits of them we might be staying in. As MPs became overwhelmed with the futility of the occasion and began drifting off to lunch, Labour’s Marsha de Cordova went for the jugular. It was clear that Esther McVey had broken the ministerial code; was the prime minister going to sack her? May reverted to her default algorithm. “It’s very clear,” she said. McVey had only made a teensy-weensy mistake by twice misleading parliament and everyone deserved a second chance. So the work and pensions secretary would be making a half-hearted apology as a brief point of order at the end of PMQs. Was that OK? McVey, aka The Duracell Bunny, was quick to disabuse the prime minister. Her apology was going to be virtually non-existent, not half-hearted. “Yeahbutnobutyeahbutnobutyeahbutsowhat?” she said defiantly as the Labour benches called for her to resign. She wasn’t sorry. She’d never been sorry. The people who hadn’t got their universal credit payments on time deserved to starve. And she was going nowhere. Partly because she was entirely without shame. But also because the prime minister was too feeble to do the right thing. End of days."

          "bodyText": "Ford’s Trumpish tendencies According to Ian Lee, a professor at Carleton University, Doug Ford’s political victory in Ontario (15 June) is unrelated to rightwing populist trends in the US and Europe. However, the new Conservative premier’s background and public behaviour is quite Trumpish, including Ford’s record of publicly belittling gay pride activists and the developmentally handicapped. Lee also credits Ford’s victory to the province’s rejection of defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne, “who had steered the province to the left”. Such simplistic analysis imagines sharp ideological borders that encourage exclusion rather than compromise. Lee’s quoted remarks may well reflect his quantitative perspective rather than the messy complexity of reality. Morgan Duchesney Ottawa, Ontario, Canada An asteroid problem to crack There’s a problem with your article on asteroid mining (There’s gold in them thar asteroids, 22 June). It talks of small spaceships that could be “propelled using super-hot water vapour heated to 1,000C”, and that would be able to “refuel in space either directly with water [from the asteroids] or the hydrogen and oxygen that can be created from it.” You need two things to get a vessel moving in the vacuum of space: some mass to throw out the back end and a source of energy to get that mass moving. In a conventional rocket the fuel fulfils both functions. The water from the asteroid could provide the mass, but not the energy. Sure, recombining its oxygen and hydrogen could produce energy, but you need energy to break the water down to oxygen and hydrogen in the first place. So, absent such an external energy source, of which the article makes no mention, instead of being able to “zip around merrily with no end to their useful life” these spaceships would be stuck on their asteroids for all eternity. Stuart Corner Enmore, NSW, Australia Abortion and women’s rights I can support an argument for liberalising Ireland’s abortion law (1 June) as a legal compromise aimed at protecting women from unsafe backstreet abortions. But I find incomprehensible a claim that this is a “victory for women’s rights”. Anyone with a knowledge of human biology knows that every cell in the foetus is genetically different from the rest of the mother’s body. This is a vulnerable human being at an early stage of development and needs the protection of the law. This is what makes abortion a difficult legal dilemma, one that is side-stepped by so-called radical feminist rhetoric. Isn’t this just another example of the hypocrisy and double standards involved in applying human rights discourse? Vinoth Ramachandra Colombo, Sri Lanka Libraries need human touch You mention in your 22 June editorial (Libraries give us power) that in Britain (and other countries), library hours are being extended by leaving them unstaffed. Needless to say, this idea, from many a librarian’s point of view, is not a good one, especially when security is at stake. To say nothing of the possibility, as pointed out elsewhere in the same issue (Slave to the algorithm, by James Bridle) that technology may exceed itself “beyond our control”. In the case of libraries, only the presence of a real librarian can provide personal, non-robotic user assistance, as well as proper management of a library’s uniquely valuable riches. As Bridle says, “Computers are not here to give us all the answers.” Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada Briefly • It’s a bit late, but the heading I would have found most appropriate for the interview by Decca Aitkenhead with Anthony Scaramucci (15 June) would have been “The amoral meets the immoral”. Aitkenhead reminded me of an earnest relative determined to put the best face on the lifer she visits regularly in prison. How else to interpret “quick-witted, funny, fabulously good company” included as her forgiving epithets for this appalling little man? Not hard, indeed, to imagine the look on his face when he read his flattering profile in one of England’s quality papers. Bill Finn St Paul, Alberta, Canada • Jon Midgley is right that most Canadians support the (Kinder Morgan) pipeline (So sorry about Canada, Reply, 22 June) but he fails to add that a similar proportion of Canadians oppose spending government money on it – let alone buying it as Justin Trudeau has done. Simon Erskine London, UK • Re: School air pollution worse inside than out (1 June). I was a high school teacher for a few years in Montreal, enduring the hot, humid summers and many a plea for outdoor classes. Good on the Guardian for drawing attention to this problem and, more importantly, for crafting a new arsenal of arguments for today’s youth. Jesse Gutman Toronto, Ontario, Canada • I laughed to see, in Signs of life on Mars (15 June), that this life was long dead. Mars is a vision of how Earth will look when we’re done with it.

          "headline": "Joe Cole: ‘I was ready to deliver a kicking’",
          "bodyText": "You might know Joe Cole as a Brummie, from Peaky Blinders, where he played John Shelby, the much-loved gangster kid brother to Cillian Murphy’s Tommy. Or maybe as a Manc, from the Hang the DJ episode of Black Mirror, in which true love was shown to triumph in an age of algorithm-sanctioned pairings. Or, if you catch him in his latest film, A Prayer Before Dawn, where he’s a Liverpudlian boxer turned Thai prisoner turned Muay Thai fighter, using mostly non- verbal gestures to ask to fight or to plead for drugs. “I’ve not done my own accent in years,” says Cole, 29, his own voice deep, slightly gruff, with a south London twang. Last night, he was watching the World Cup with mates in a bar near where he lives now, in Brixton, but today we’re in a Hitchcock-themed hotel on the outskirts of the capital, drinking in the bucolic surroundings of Epping Forest. He’s on a rare break from filming, having been working almost solidly since he chucked in his old job of selling carpets. Apart from the football, he’s been going to auditions, but there can’t be many accents left for him to tick off. Scottish? “I just went in for Scottish the other day,” he smiles. Cole has become one of those actors whose presence is usually an indication of quality, particularly on TV, though A Prayer Before Dawn, which called for a complete transformation and total immersion in a tough, violent world, could do for his big screen career what Bronson did for Tom Hardy. He was raised in Kingston-upon-Thames, the oldest brother of five (three of the five are now actors). “I was a bit of a wind-up, a joker,” he remembers, but puts it down to growing up in a busy house. “And my mum used to look after kids after school, so there were always at least 10 people in the house. Always.” Recently, he moved into a one-bedroom flat on his own, for the first time in his life, but the isolation didn’t stick. “I quickly realised it wasn’t for me. I love my own company, but not permanently. I’m used to a house of people coming and going. I don’t think I ever remember being on my own in the house.” Now, he lives in a houseshare with friends, and one of his brothers. He started acting at school, where one particular teacher – “an inspiring, amazing teacher, Miss O’Shea” – made drama seem like fun. “Our school didn’t have as much money as the surrounding schools, but her and the music teacher would go out of their way to make these productions better than they should have been,” he recalls. Up until his GCSEs, he was a high achiever, top set, and found it all easy, but when A-levels came around, he started to falter. “When I actually had to put in some work, I realised I was middle of the pack, and for me that wasn’t enough, so I didn’t do any work, messed about, went out, and it wasn’t going to plan.” He calls his later teenage years “tricky”. “I had a bit of a bad break-up, I didn’t get into university, I felt very sorry for myself,” he laughs. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I did. I got arrested. I was just getting up to nonsense, really.” He went back to school, in his brother’s year, and retook his exams, after realising that his current life as a carpet salesman wasn’t quite right. “I mean this with no disrespect at all, but it wasn’t for me.” Then he applied to the National Youth Theatre – and got in. Cole puts a lot of his success down to self-belief and optimism, to a certainty that, once he’d decided he was going to be an actor, he was passionate enough to do the work he needed to do to make it happen. “I remember watching Skins when I was at college, when I was fucking around and fucking my life up, and I was watching Skins, like, I could be there. I’ve got more fire in my belly, I’ve got more to say, and I reckon I could go and do that. And that was my mindset.” It didn’t take long for it to come to fruition. One of his first breakout roles was as Luke, a drug-dealing bad boy, in series six of Skins. “To see me come out of the other side of that and flourish was just a relief for my mum,” he explains. Given that he’s got an angelic sort of face, with long eyelashes and plump lips, it’s perhaps surprising he’s cast as a rogue as often as he is. But Cole has a long line in bad boys and hard men, from an early role in Offender, set against the backdrop of the 2011 London riots, to the short film Slap, in which he played a cross-dressing boxer. Then, of course, there was John Shelby, the baby Peaky Blinder, who met a gangster’s fate at the beginning of series five. The show has been a bona fide hit and, as well as winning awards all over the place, it’s set a fashion precedent, unlocking many men’s desire to look like a 1920s criminal. “The haircuts?” he smiles. “People absolutely love it, it’s amazing. With television, people respond in a different way, it’s crazy. I have some friends who’ve done big films and stuff, but the love for Peaky Blinders just completely takes over from that.” It was Cole who decided to step away from the show, despite its huge success. “We started shooting in 2012, so it’s five series, but it’s gone on for six years. I’ve had a great run and loved every minute, but I’m trying to push on, to do new things and challenge myself. For me it was definitely the right time.” He says that people were so gutted by John’s exit, they still come up to him in the street, “crying and stuff, which is mad. What more can you ask for as an actor, if people respond to your work like that?” He was pleased to get the part of Frank in Black Mirror almost as soon as he’d decided to leave Peaky (as he calls it) because it showed what he already knew – that he had the range to play a romantic lead as well as a tough guy. But he’s returning to the hard stuff for A Prayer Before Dawn. It’s an adaptation of a memoir by Billy Moore. He was locked up in a brutal Thai prison for three years and found a kind of salvation in prison-sanctioned Muay Thai fighting. Shot over three months, somewhere north of Bangkok, it’s distressing, clammy and harrowing, and almost entirely mute; many scenes were improvised, and the language barrier, deliberately maintained between Cole and the Thai cast, prevented a lot of talking. Instead, much of the communication is done through fists and feet. “I was ready to put myself on the line, and spar for real and fight, and get the shit kicked out of me, and deliver a few kickings as well,” Cole says. “I was ready to go there, and I’m not sure everybody would go there, even if they say they would. I’d like a few of the lads to prove me wrong, but we’ll see.” He’s sporty anyway, so enjoyed the Muay Thai training and getting ripped for the part. “It was simple, but regimented. Train every day, eat the same food, a couple of press-ups.” Just two? “I did two press-ups. Amazing, right? One at the beginning of the shoot and one right at the end,” he says. “I should get in touch with Men’s Health.” Cole says he’s not one for “method” acting – he does disdainful inverted commas with his fingers when he says the word – but admits he found it difficult to shake this one. “It was long, heavy hard days with a lot of fighting every single day. I remember getting on the plane and feeling very emotional. Sounds a bit naff, but I did. It’s the first job I did where I’ve felt emotional afterwards. I thought, even if this turns out to be a pile of shite, it’s been one hell of a ride. We all felt we were making something special.” He applies the same kind of logic to his career so far. “Listen, the rug could be pulled out at any time,” he says, an apt metaphor for a former carpet salesman, “so let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But even if I had to quit tomorrow, I’m pretty happy. I am content. And I think mainly I’m content because of this film.” Still, that’s not to say he’s ready to coast. He’s been working on his own scripts, and has a couple of writing projects on the go that he’s quietly confident about. And he’s about to star in Channel 4’s new drama Pure, in which he’ll play a recovering porn addict – and he’s doing close to his own accent in this one… On Twitter, Cole’s handle is “theotherjoecole”, but you get the sense any mix-ups between him and his footballing namesake will be happening less and less. Though he says the postman still seems disappointed. “‘Oh my God, I thought you were gonna be famous. I thought you were gonna be the footballer,’” he mimics, grinning. “Nah, not me mate. Just a regular Joe.” A Prayer Before Dawn is in cinemas from 20 July"

          "bodyText": "Seeing the same doctor (GP and specialists) over a number of years may be a matter of life and death, according to a study published today. A team of researchers looked at 22 studies from nine countries and found 18 that showed a marked link between continuity of care and lower death rates, after correcting for a range of variables. If you want a medical opinion nowadays, your options are mind-boggling. But as the range of options increases, your chances of getting to see the same doctor twice are diminishing. It’s like your favourite restaurant forever changing and expanding the menu, but never offering your favourite dish more than once. You can use AI platforms such as Babylon, which announced this week that its chatbot outperforms doctors in questions from the GP membership exam. Or chat to an algorithm-driven human on the NHS free helpline, 111. Or register with an online GP service that will only see you face-to face in exceptional circumstances. NHS choices offers online, evidence-based, reliable and sensible advice on a huge variety of medical conditions and questions. If you want to see a human being, there are urgent care centres, out-of-hours hub appointments at local surgeries that you can book online or via your own GP surgery or, if you’re very ill or have a lot of time on your hands, you can rock up at A&amp;E. But what if you just want to see a family doctor whom you recognise? Ideally someone you’ve seen with a few bits and bobs over the years and have come to trust? Ah, now that’s going to be more tricky. So should jobbing GPs such as me, who’ve sat behind the same desk for nigh-on 30 years, who know up to four generations of the same families and are embedded in the local community, accept the seemingly inevitable? Take the nameplate off the front door and get well-paid locum work for a private provider that populates large health centres with GPs who are paid by the hour? What does the public really want? When you’re busy, working and essentially well, you probably want an efficient way of getting prescriptions and a quick way of checking whether what you’ve read on Google is correct. GP surgeries are variable but most (79%) are rated “good” by CQC, which means they have had to demonstrate that they’re safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led. That should include electronic prescribing to send routine prescriptions to your nominated pharmacy, an online appointment-booking system and good access to healthcare professionals via the phone and email. When you’re ill, distressed, confused or scared, it’s normal to want to see someone you know and trust. A study published last year showed that older people who see the same GP over time have fewer avoidable hospital admissions. This was particularly true for people who see their GP a lot. There tended to be less continuity of care in larger practices. In a linked editorial, researchers said that seeing the same doctor “builds trust and a sense of mutual responsibility”, while a primary care system that is increasingly fragmented means that patients may choose A&amp;E instead. For me, the key words there are “mutual trust”. If I were to work as a locum, sent to a different practice each time, I would act professionally and do the job. But would I try as hard, stay as late and fret as much as I do for the patients whom I’ve known for 30 years? Would I be as effective if I didn’t have any local knowledge of services, pathways, specialists and hospitals? Babylon would certainly beat me in some MRCGP exam questions but does an AI tool tease out the human story, the unspoken fears, the existential torment? I’m not saying that in a rushed 10-minute consultation I get it right all the time. But medicine is an art as well as a science, and meaningful communication lies at its core. For a proper heart-to-heart, most of us want to speak to another human, preferably one we know. • Ann Robinson is a GP"

          "bodyText": "It’s a long and noble Hollywood tradition: an actor scores the coveted Academy Award at long last, and then promptly squanders that industry cachet on the most mortifying work of their entire career. Mere days after picking up a statuette for Boyhood, Patricia Arquette was off solving computer-crimes on CSI: Cyber. Eddie Redmayne took home the gold for The Theory of Everything, and celebrated by bellowing his way through an utterly incomprehensible turn in Jupiter Ascending. A decade and a half out from his win for The Pianist, and Adrien Brody is still doing this. To this proud list we may now add Gary Oldman, who may not have won this year’s best actor prize at all if Netflix’s new sci-fi picture Tau got a release prior to the voting deadline. (Scholars refer to this occurrence as “the Murphy”, in reference to Eddie Murphy’s Oscar-killing performance in Norbit.) Oldman voices the title character, an artificial intelligence program tasked with keeping reluctant test subject Julia (a lost-looking Maika Monroe) captive, and not since Patrick Stewart voiced a literal pile of feces in The Emoji Movie has an actor so thoroughly embarrassed themselves without appearing onscreen. Tau’s creator Alex (Ed Skrein) informs Julia that this Siri-on-steroids is his technological magnum opus, an automated sentience so advanced that it must be “cut off from the world” to prevent it from exceeding safe limitation. What this actually entails is unclear, as is the case with many things in the film. (To wit: why Julia is referred to as subject #3 despite being explicitly named as their seventh prisoner, why Alex needs a human being to test an AI, why the final 20 minutes spring a sneak attack of gore on an unsuspecting viewership.) In practice, however, all that really means is the most sophisticated feat of computer engineering in human history acts like a complete blithering idiot. For the impressively moronic dialogue, Oldman brings a lack of imagination so complete that he could plausibly explain this performance away as a high-concept ironic joke. Tau is capable of managing Alex’s inexplicably mood-lighting-splotched domicile of the future, and speaks with the buttoned-up diction of a user agreement. But somehow, it possesses zero factual information, and thusly must badger Julia with incessant questions like an inquisitive three-year-old. What is the sky? Why didn’t cavemen live in houses? What does it mean to be … alive? Julia doesn’t have a great answer for him, and neither does the movie containing her. The director, Federico D’Alessandro, and screenwriter, Noga Landau, have purloined Ex Machina’s motherboard and transplanted it onto machinery with faulty wiring; while both films ponder the precise location of the line separating a person from a convincing facsimile thereof, Tau’s choice to reverse the gender dynamic scrambles its philosophizing. Alex Garland’s film plugged the stock noir plot of a woman making a lecherous man her patsy into futuristic hardware, making the faint suggestion that cunning may be the X-factor separating humanity from our cyborg cousins. Even in this broad thematic wheelhouse, D’Alessandro and Landau can’t muster a single idea beyond “I think, therefore I am”, and they’re about four centuries late to that particular pearl of wisdom. When not striking a thoughtful pose, the script behaves like any other captive-woman drama does. Julia cowers, concocts daring escape attempts that invariably go awry, and eventually goes with the oldest trick in the book by turning Stockholm syndrome on her captor. Her blossoming relationship with the profoundly dim Tau leaves Alex to fill the villain role, which he does as flatly as possible. Skrein has none of the typical mad scientist’s kooky charisma or manic abandon, only the sadistic streak. The lone thing separating him from the nightly news’ usual predator is a big investor meeting mentioned no fewer than four times. Perhaps Alex created Tau in his own image: unaccountably dumb for a self-proclaimed genius. Sci-fi has a reputation as the most conspicuously cerebral film genre, and Netflix appears to be on a mission to change that. Tau’s potent mixture of derivative 22nd-century production design with a visible lack of brain activity must play to whatever algorithm compelled the streaming giant to pick up Mute, The Cloverfield Paradox, Anon, Lucid Dream, The Titan, What Happened to Monday, and Orbiter 9. The middling-to-unforgivable sci-fi picture is Netflix’s calling card, saved from the straight-to-video bin by the internet’s infinite sprawl. These films become interchangeable the moment they’re over, in which case Oldman’s calamitous vocal work may be an asset if for no other reason than setting this apart from the slew of all-but-identical duds. Tau may go down as an awkward thorn in Oldman’s filmography, but it’ll be right at home in Netflix’s content library. Tau is now available on Netflix"

          "bodyText": "It’s come to something when Theresa May regards prime minister’s questions as a bit of light rest and recreation. Not that the Labour leader is going out of his way to make things easy for her. Just that life within the Tory party has now descended into near farce. With almost every member of the cabinet engaged in open warfare with another minister, May can no longer bring herself to switch on the radio; she can’t bear to hear the latest blue-on-blue action. When even Liz Truss feels bold enough to get stuck in, the game is near enough up. The prime minister without authority. The woman without qualities. Corbyn began as if he only had to remain conscious to score an easy win. In the ongoing battle between Greg “Mr Business” Clark and Boris “Fuck Business” Johnson, whose side was she on? That was easy. Right now everyone hates Boris. There are signs that even Boris might hate Boris. Inside every narcissist there’s a torrent of self-loathing waiting to be unleashed. A blonde amoral blob of self-pity in desperate search of a single principle over which he could resign to become the hero of his own narrative. So, yes, in a straight fight between Boris and Anyone Else in the Entire World, May was on the side of Anyone. Even Corbyn. But especially business. She loved business. That was odd, the Labour leader continued, because business didn’t seem to love her. How did she explain that the CBI, Airbus, BMW, Siemens and Honda were all so worried about the way the government was handling Brexit they had gone public with their concerns? “We are very clear,” May said, reverting to her default algorithm. “We are listening to business.” The problem was that she didn’t much like what she was hearing, so had chosen to ignore it. What the people had voted for was a government that was at war with itself. One that was unable to even agree on a future trading relationship that the EU had already rejected. One that was so dim it hadn’t yet understood that a no deal was the worst possible deal. So that was the type of leadership she was determined to show. Round about now, Corbyn seemed to lose concentration. Admittedly not hard to do when faced with the prime minister’s very obvious confusion and limited grasp of language, but the country needs rather more of an opposition leader at PMQs. It is only 15 minutes each week, after all. Many Labour backbenchers sensed Corbyn’s moment had passed and started playing with their phones. With the Tories in the mess they are, Labour should be winning in style, not scraping through on penalties after a messy 0-0 draw. May’s jibes that, as a Brexiter himself, Corbyn may be closer in spirit to Boris than his own party had more than a ring of truth. “We are putting jobs at the heart of what we do in relation to Brexit,” the prime minister insisted. Her own and the rest of her cabinet’s. Most of them would struggle to find alternative work. She ended by reciting a list that one of her advisers had written out for her of all the government’s achievements. It didn’t take long. There was a plan to end childhood obesity with a childhood obesity plan. There other plans to do various other things that hadn’t quite materialised. They were going to create a Britain fit for the future. Fit to do what was anyone’s guess. It was left to Labour’s Mary Creagh to ask the killer question. Would the prime minister congratulate the foreign secretary for expressing what her hard Brexit would do to business? May’s eyes rotated manically but no coherent words came out. After that, Labour rather let the Tories do what they liked doing best. Warring among themselves in public. Greg Hands took a swipe at the speaker before going studs up on Boris, while Heidi Allen stamped on Chris Grayling’s already battered body. May joined in gratefully. Anything to keep the wolves away from her."

          "bodyText": "Scientists have developed a thin, lightweight and flexible film that can outfox infrared cameras, allowing hot bodies to appear cool and cold items to appear warm. The invention can also help camouflage an object by making it appear the same temperature as its background. The design was inspired by the colour-shifting capabilities of cuttlefish, says Coskun Kocabas, a co-author of the research from the University of Manchester. The approach involves using electricity to alter the properties of the film, so that it changes from acting more like a “black body” – which absorbs and emits electromagnetic radiation but does not reflect it – to becoming more like a metal, which reflects radiation but is not good at absorbing or emitting it. Kocabas said the film could have a number of uses. “One obvious application is of course camouflage, but the novelty in this is it is adaptive camouflage,” he said, adding it could also be useful for covering radiators on satellites, allowing them to be tweaked to reflect heat when facing the sun and emit excess heat when facing deep space. Writing in the journal Nano Letters, Kocabas and colleagues in the US and Turkey reveal how they created the material using a stack made of nylon, gold, polyethylene soaked in a liquid composed of charged molecules, and multiple layers of graphene. Graphene, a honeycomb sheet of carbon one atom thick that has been dubbed a “wonder material”, is very good at emitting heat in the form of radiation. As a result, when the device is rested on a person’s hand, the heat it gains from the hand is emitted as infrared light, meaning that when a thermal camera is pointed at the device, an image of the person’s hand can be seen. But there’s a twist. The team found that when a voltage was applied across the device, the charged molecules in the polyethylene layer became incorporated within the graphene layers. That, they found, reduced the level of infrared light the graphene could emit. “They go into the graphene and they change [the] conductivity of graphene and they change [the] optics of graphene,” said Kocabas. “We are basically changing graphene into metal.” As a result, when the team applied three volts to the device, the image of the person’s hand could no longer be seen when the device was viewed through the infrared camera. The team then set up a sensor to measure the changing temperature of a surface, and used that information, via an algorithm, to adjust the voltage applied to the device – which itself was kept at a constant temperature. As a result, they were able to change the apparent warmth of the device as seen through an infrared camera, allowing it thermally blend into the surface in less than five seconds, even though its actual temperature did not change. The team say the system can currently work between temperatures of 25C and 38C. Further work revealed that incorporation of the charged molecules into the graphene doesn’t just affect the device’s ability to emit infrared light – it also changes how reflective the device is. The team found when the device itself is kept at a temperature hotter than its surroundings, increasing the voltage decreases the apparent temperature of the device. That is because the device is now less able to emit infrared light and, although it is now more reflective, there is little infrared light to reflect. However, Kocabas said, when the device is kept cooler than the surroundings and a voltage is applied, the device appears warmer than it really is because there is now more infrared light to reflect from its surroundings."

          "bodyText": "The former Nato secretary general Javier Solana has been refused a visa waiver to enter the US because of his past trips to Iran, one of the countries blacklisted by the US Department of Homeland Security. Solana, who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal during his time as the EU’s foreign policy chief, had been due to speak at an event at Washington’s Brookings Institution, but learned he would not be able to enter the US after trying to apply for an electronic visa waiver. Under the system, those who have visited any of seven blacklisted countries – Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen – on or after 1 March 2011 are barred from receiving the waiver and have to apply for a visa. The rules predate Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban on five Muslim-majority countries and North Korea. “It’s a bit of a mean decision,” Solana told Spain’s Antena 3 TV channel on Monday. “I don’t think it’s good because some people have to visit these complicated countries to keep negotiations alive.” Solana, who has also served as Spain’s foreign minister, said he had been invited to Iran in 2013 to attend President Rouhani’s inauguration. “I went there to represent all those who had been involved in the negotiations,” he said. “I’ll see what I can do to fix this. It’s a computer – an algorithm – and if you’ve been in Iran lately, they take you out of the system. It’s like you don’t exist visa-wise, because you can’t visit the country.” Solana said he hoped to resolve the situation soon as he had professional commitments to honour in the US: “I need to go because I need to work there and I’m a professor at various universities.” France’s ambassador to the US, Gérard Araud, reacted to the news on Twitter, noting that the visa policy had been introduced under the Obama administration. “Strange that our American friends are discovering only now this Obama regulation,” he wrote. “Scores of European scholars, parliamentarians and business people have already faced the same constraints.” Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last month, despite strenuous European objections. Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the deal, signed in 2015, and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. Asked for comment on Solana’s case, a spokeswoman for US Customs and Border Protection said: “Without getting into specific cases, this is part of legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama.” Additional reporting by Julian Borger"

          "headline": "Facebook creates Orwellian headache as news is labelled politics",
          "bodyText": "George Orwell wrote in his essay Politics and the English Language: “In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues.” When Facebook constructed a new archive of political advertising, had it thought a little more about this concept of what is “political”, it might have more accurately anticipated the subsequent Orwellian headache. As it is, journalists are finding their articles restricted from promotion because they are lumped in with campaigning materials from politicians, lobby groups and advocacy organisations. The new archive of ads with political content, which Facebook made public last month, has become the latest contested piece of territory between platforms and publishers. The complaint from publishers is that Facebook is categorising posts in which they are promoting their own journalism (paying money to target particular groups of the audience) as “political ads”. Publishers have reacted furiously to what they see as toxic taxonomy. Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the New York Times, has been the most vocal critic, describing Facebook’s practices as “a threat to democracy” and criticising the platform in a recent speech to the Open Markets Initiative in Washington DC. “When it comes to news, Facebook still doesn’t get it,” said Thompson. “In its effort to clear up one bad mess, it seems to be joining those who want to blur the line between reality-based journalism and propaganda.” At a separate event at Columbia University, Thompson and Facebook’s head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, fought openly about the initiative. Thompson showed examples of where New York Times articles, including recipes, had been wrongly flagged as political. Brown emphasised that the archive was being refined, but stood firm on the principle that promoted journalism ought to be flagged as “paid-for” political posts. “On this you are just wrong,” she told Thompson. Publishers took to social platforms to question the labelling and representation of their work. One of the most egregious examples came from investigative journalism organisation Reveal. Last week, at the height of the scandal around the separation of undocumented migrant families crossing the US border, it published an exclusive story involving the alleged drugging of children at a centre housing immigrant minors. It was flagged in the Facebook system as containing political content, and as Reveal had not registered its promotion of the story, the promoted posts were stifled. Facebook did not remove the article, but rather stopped its paid circulation. Given the importance of paid promotion, it is not surprising that publishers see this as amounting to the same thing. The furore and confusion over what had happened to the post demonstrated that publishers were themselves confused about the new system. It also demonstrated the way in which even a well-intentioned initiative to add more clarity to political advertising could in fact militate against the rapid spread of what many would consider important high-quality news. The central problem exposed by Facebook’s advertising archive is the flaw in its entire business model. Targeted advertising represents 98% of Facebook’s revenues which were $40bn last year. Many people who use Facebook remain unaware that what shows up in their news feed can get there two ways: it is targeted by an algorithm based on their behaviour, profile and preferences; and often it is targeted at their demographic by paid promotion. It is routine for publishers to pay to boost pages of their own journalism in order for them to reach a wider audience. In fact for many publishers it is a prerequisite of being read, as Facebook does not recognise or seek to categorise good journalism or urgent news over any other material. It is precisely these mechanics which led in the 2016 US election cycle to the platform playing host to all types of propaganda and “fake news” often masquerading as legitimate journalism. The idea that Facebook should add transparency to what was being paid for as political advertising was almost universally welcomed as a “first step” to combating misinformation. The friction over its implementation highlights a key tension within Facebook and all tech companies when it comes to dealing with cultural concepts. Should companies just rely far more heavily on human judgment or should they leave it to algorithms? Robots, algorithms, computers and maths are amazingly potent in their capacity to sort unique objects: faces, places, images and text can be searched and identified quickly at great scale. But things which are not unique, or which carry with them inherent ambiguity – such as culture, politics, humanity even – are unsuited to evaluation by any kind of artificial intelligence application. Orwell was right, everything is political: holiday photos are political; fashion, weddings, theatre and film, architecture, are all in one sense political. (Maybe it is only the cat picture which the whole of the internet can agree on as being apolitical.) In deciding that a New Yorker piece in praise of adultery is “political”, the Facebook advertising archive algorithm might be making a profound, almost philosophical, judgment about hetero-normative values, but more likely it is just incompetently sorting material it can’t recognise. These examples are good copy, but essentially teething problems that Facebook has the capacity to solve. However, there are profound issues about the nature and control of the public sphere. As the large platforms now effectively are the internet for many people, their governance structures are of key public interest. If categorisation as being “political” has consequences for how fact-based reporting is perceived both by the public and by the algorithm, this could be catastrophic. It could lead to local news or urgent political coverage being harder to find – or prioritised according only to the amount a publisher or advertiser spends. The second is that Facebook is to some extent on the right side of the argument when it comes to labelling content. But it is unfortunately ill-equipped to deal with the type and scale of the task it has created for itself. There is a looming civic crisis in the field of political communications. The provenance of material masquerading as news often deliberately obscures funding sources and influences; comb the Facebook political advertising archive around any keyword and you will find a host of apparently neutral news media entities which are funded and controlled by hyper-partisan groups. And these groups can also pay to promote articles from other news organisations in pursuit of their own aims. The number of New York Times articles paid for by candidates boosting their own campaigns is just as large as the Times’s own promotional strategies. The unavoidable core of this issue is taking transparency into the realm of political judgment, and separating legitimate news sources from non-legitimate. Nobody, including Facebook, wishes this organisation to have such a level of control over the free press or even political campaigning. The answer to Facebook, as has often been said, cannot be more Facebook. News and journalism are now dependent on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple and others for many aspects of their existence. What is clear is that these companies are not inherently suited to be custodians of our information ecosystem, and arguably never will be."

          "headline": "Nathan Myhrvold: ‘Nasa doesn’t want to admit it’s wrong about asteroids’",
          "bodyText": "Nathan Myhrvold is the former chief technology officer of Microsoft, founder of the controversial patent asset company Intellectual Ventures and the main author of the six-volume, 2,300-page Modernist Cuisine cookbook, which explores the science of cooking. Currently, he is taking on Nasa over its measurement of asteroid sizes. For the past couple of years, you’ve been fighting with Nasa about its analysis of near-Earth asteroid size. You’ve just published a 33-page scientific paper criticising the methods used by its Neowise project team to estimate the size and other properties of approximately 164,000 asteroids. You have also published a long blog post explaining the problem. Where did Nasa go wrong and is it over or underestimating size? Nasa’s Wise space telescope [Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer] measured the asteroids in four different wavelengths in the infrared. My main beef is with how they analysed that data. What I think happened is they made some poor choices of statistical methods. Then, to cover that up, they didn’t publish a lot of the information that would help someone else replicate it. I’m afraid they have both over- and underestimated. The effect changes depending on the size of the asteroid and what it’s made of. The studies were advertised as being accurate to plus or minus 10%. In fact, it is more like 30-35%. That’s if you look overall. If you look at specific subsets some of them are off by more than 100%. It’s kind of a mess. Why does it matter? As you admit in your blogpost, obsessively arguing over the size of rocks that are millions of miles away may appear esoteric. Asteroids are very important. They tell us a lot about the origin of the solar system. The work of hundreds of scientists has been based on this Neowise data. Also, a major asteroid impact will affect life on Earth at some point, just as it has multiple times in the past. The data are critical to assessing this risk. If there is a mistake by a factor of two in the diameter, which there are for a bunch, that’s a mistake of a factor of eight in the energy. You must have spent many hours and a lot of money working on this. You even hired lawyers to help lodge freedom of information requests. Has it been worth it? I am guilty of being stubborn. Once this started, I was left with a stark choice: give up or keep going. If they had ever said: “You probably have a point, we’ll look into it in our next version”, I probably would have stopped. But because of the way they reacted, I felt I couldn’t let it go. I am not hoping for it, but if in those thousands of asteroids there is [one] heading towards us and we can better estimate its size, I will feel vindicated. Nasa’s reported response has been to stand by the data and the analysis performed by the Neowise team. Can we trust Nasa after this? They need to have an independent investigation of these results. When my preprint paper came out in 2016, they said: “You shouldn’t believe it because it’s not peer-reviewed.” Well, now it has been peer reviewed. How Nasa handles it at this stage will be very telling. People have suggested to me the reason Nasa doesn’t want to admit that anything is wrong with the data is that they’re afraid it would hurt the chances of Neocam, an approximately $500m (£380m) telescope to find asteroids that might hit Earth proposed by the same group who did the Neowise analysis. This isn’t the first time you have found fault in scientists’ analyses. In 2013, you challenged estimates of the growth rate of dinosaurs, which led to some corrections by the papers’ authors. Do you enjoy being a thorn in their side? Agatha Christie books and other mystery novels feature an amateur crime solver: a “Miss Marple”. That’s me, it seems. In the case of the dinosaurs, I made some material changes in the field. I feel the same thing will happen with the asteroids. When I wrote the paper [challenging the dinosaur analysis], a lot of other dinosaur people said: “I’m glad you did that, I suspected the numbers were wrong.” But either they weren’t confident enough with statistics, or they were afraid. Similarly, when my asteroid preprint first came out, I got emails from several people in that community saying the same. It’s hugely liberating [to be an outsider]. The fact that I have already given myself tenure at the University of Nathan, I don’t have to worry about looking for grants like others might. In 2015, you built this robotic model of a dinosaur tail that showed a dinosaur could break the sound barrier when it cracked its tail. You also fund palaeontology digs and I believe you keep a lifesize T-rex skeleton in your living room. Are you working on anything dinosaur-related at the moment? One thing is a big comparative study to try to understand why dinosaurs got so damn big. A lot of it has to do not with why dinosaurs got so big, but why mammals are small. Mammals have some problems when they’re very large – like pregnancy – that dinosaurs didn’t have. For dinosaurs, laying eggs made it a lot easier to be big. In 2000, you left Microsoft and set up Intellectual Ventures, which primarily buys and licenses patents. The business is often vilified as one of the world’s biggest “patent trolls”. Why do you think people find it so loathsome? I fundamentally think what we do is good. It is hard for me to get too worked up about figuring out why it is bad. Any patent holder who enforces their rights gets called a patent troll. Silicon Valley feels very threatened by anything that could challenge its authority. If you are one of the big companies, like Google or Apple, almost no one can challenge you in the market that you’re in. But if somebody has a patent, they can ask for a bunch of money. The more you can get a return from an invention, the better off the world will be. It will lead to more inventions being funded and more inventing. How many patents do you have? I’d guess altogether we have around 30,000. Around 3,000 of those my company invented. Personally I probably have about 800. It changes every Tuesday, which is the day the patent office issues patents. We still only have a drop in the bucket. There are around 4m active US patents. Intellectual Ventures also has this “global good” arm that is collaborating with Bill Gates. What are some of the inventions coming out of that and how close are they to fruition? We’ve invented a vaccine container that keeps vaccine cold even without refrigeration. That has played a crucial role in the Ebola outbreaks and has been rolled out across Africa for other diseases. It has made an enormous difference in people’s lives. One that’s coming is we’ve invented a very cheap, noninvasive test for cervical cancer. It does remarkably better than any other technique. We designed it for developing countries but there is interest in using it here in the US, too. We take a picture of the cervix. We have a machine-learning algorithm that learned how to diagnose cervical cancer by looking at pictures. Our latest thing is a plastic speculum, a rubber band, and an iPhone. It’s really cheap and it only takes a minute. We’re working on diagnostic trials. You also have commercial spinouts from Intellectual Ventures. One of them is developing a new kind of nuclear reactor. What’s different about it and where are you towards building it? For a very long time there was really not that much effort put in to designing radical new kinds of reactors. Instead, everyone made tiny little modifications to old reactors. We realised that, so we got into the game. There are a tremendous number of opportunities that one has to make reactors that are cheaper, safer, and which can do really cool things like burn nuclear waste as fuel. That’s really important because the world has thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste sitting around that is otherwise a big problem.Turning that into fuel that would be fantastic and we are looking at projects in China and other parts of the world. Nuclear reactors take a long time to build, but we’re hoping in the 2020s we’ll see our first. President Trump is going after China’s intellectual property theft. Given your experience, can he succeed in curbing it? The theft of intellectual property by Chinese companies is a very serious issue. It’s not just private companies in China or little companies. A large amount of it is state-owned enterprise. So, it really is the Chinese government doing it. Exactly how to solve that issue, I don’t know. You need the Chinese government to be very serious about it, but so far they haven’t been. In my experience in business, you mostly do better with negotiating in quiet diplomacy, not with brinksmanship. But I’ve never built luxury hotels and golf courses. Maybe it is different there. Your cookbooks, most recently Modernist Bread, cost hundreds of dollars, weigh kilograms and are full of striking photos that you took. You’re in Brazil researching your next book, about pizza. What does Brazil have to do with pizza? The US has had pizza since lots of immigrants from Italy brought it with them in the late 19th century. Well, so, too, for Brazil and Argentina, which is our next stop. One of the things about pizza is, when it goes to some new area, people tend to mutate it and develop their own unique style. One of the styles of Brazilian pizza is an ultra-thin crust: thinner than a cracker, and stiff, with a thin layer of toppings. Also, because they have lots of tropical ingredients, you get pizzas with bananas on. Sliced hard-boiled eggs are also pretty common. You use innovative photography techniques and custom-made equipment to show food in a whole different way. Many people post pictures of their brunch on Instagram. Do you have any tips for better shots? It’s really hard to get a good shot with the flash that’s on your cell phone, so you usually want to turn that off. Very bright, directional light also usually looks bad: you get harsh shadows. You want a broad light source near your food. Get near a window. Of course, some restaurants, for reasons I still don’t understand, make it so damn dark. I think it’s supposed to be romantic or something. What’s next due a “Nathaning”? It is really hard for me to predict what’s going to be next. Many of the things I am doing now I wouldn’t have predicted I would be doing a couple years ago. On the cooking front, at some point we have to address dessert, but we haven’t figured out how yet. We’re still working on pizza."

          "bodyText": "In common with perhaps 15 million South Africans, Eunice Sewaphe does not have a street address. Her two-room house is in a village called Relela, in a verdant, hilly region of the Limpopo province, five hours’ drive north-east of Johannesburg. If you visited Relela, you might be struck by several things the village lacks – modern sanitation, decent roads, reliable electricity – before you were struck by a lack of street names or house numbers. But living essentially off-map has considerable consequence for people like Eunice. It makes it tough to get a bank account, hard to register to vote, difficult to apply for a job or even receive a letter. For the moment, though, those ongoing concerns are eclipsed by another, larger anxiety. Eunice Sewaphe is nine months pregnant – her first child is due in two days’ time – and she is not quite sure, without an address, how she will get to hospital. Sitting in the sun with Eunice and her neighbours outside her house, in a yard in which chickens peck in the red dirt, she explained to me, somewhat hesitantly, her current plan for the imminent arrival. The nearest hospital, Van Velden, in the town of Tzaneen, is 40 minutes away by car. When Eunice goes into labour, she will have to somehow get to the main road a couple of miles away in order to find a taxi, for which she and her husband have been saving up a few rand a week. If there are complications, or if the baby arrives at night, she may need an ambulance. But since no ambulance could find her house without an address, this will again necessitate her getting out to the main road. In the past, women from Relela, in prolonged labour, have had to be taken in wheelbarrows to wait for emergency transport that may or may not come. The maternal mortality rates in South Africa remain stubbornly high. Of 1.1 million births a year, 34,000 babies die. More than 1,500 women lose their lives each year in childbirth. Those statistics are a fact of life in Relela. Josephina Mohatli is one of Eunice’s neighbours. She explains quietly how she went into labour with her first child prematurely. When she finally managed to get a taxi, she was taken to two local clinics and then a private doctor, none of which were able to help her. When she finally reached the hospital after several desperate hours, her baby had died. I have come up to Relela with Dr Coenie Louw, who is the regional head of the charity Gateway Health, which is concerned with improving those mortality statistics. Dr Louw, 51, speaks with a gruff Afrikaans accent that belies his evangelist’s optimism to make a change for these women. “Though frankly,” he says, “if I don’t know where you are, I can’t help you.” Google Maps will only bring help to the edge of the village. “We tried to do something by triangulating between three cell phone towers,” he says, which proved predictably unreliable. Searching for other solutions, Louw came across what3words, the innovative British technology that, among many other things, neatly solves the question of how an ambulance might find Eunice Sewaphe. Five years ago, the founders of what3words divided the entire surface of the planet into a grid of squares, each one measuring 3 metres by 3 metres. There are 57tn of these squares, and each one of them has been assigned a unique three-word address. My own front door in London has the three-word address “span.brave.tree”. The front door of Eunice’s house in Relela might be “irrigates.joyful.zipper” (or, in Zulu, “phephani.khuluma.bubhaka”). To test the system, I have driven up here with one of Gateway Health’s drivers, Mandla Maluleke. Maluleke has keyed the three-word code into his phone app, which has dropped a pin on a conventional mapping system. Once we leave the main highway, the GPS immediately signals “unknown road”, but even so, after many twists and turns it takes us precisely to “irrigates.joyful.zipper”, and Eunice’s front door. The what3words technology was the idea of Chris Sheldrick, a native of rural Hertfordshire (who knows what it is like to stand out in a country lane flagging down delivery drivers armed only with a postcode). Like all the best ideas he developed this one to cope with a specific problem that had maddened him. Sheldrick, 35, had started life as a musician, and then after a sleepwalking accident, which damaged his wrist, he set up a business organising musicians and production for festivals and parties around the world. Despite the advent of Google Maps, the problem that dogged his business was bands turning up at the wrong site entrance. Sheldrick employed a person whose sole duty was to man a phone line trying to get a band to the right field. Having given up on conventional satnav they tried using GPS co-ordinates, but get one figure wrong, and the party never got started. Sheldrick thought that there had to be a better way. Looking back now, he says that “the key thing we were trying to solve with what3words was how do we get 15 digits of latitude and longitude into a more communicable human form”. Advances in satellite mapping and navigation meant that if you were a Deliveroo rider or an Amazon courier or a last-minute saxophonist you were never really lost, but also often not exactly in the right place. Companies like Google and TomTom recognised this problem, but the solution they developed was an alphanumeric code of nine characters. For Sheldrick that was clearly a nonstarter: “When someone asked where you lived, it would be like trying to remember your wifi router password.” That’s when this idea of three words came up. A bit of maths proved it was possible. “With 40,000 recognisable dictionary words, you have 64tn combinations, and there are 57tn squares.” The algorithm behind what3words took six months to write. Sheldrick worked on it with two friends he had grown up with. Mohan Ganesalingham, a maths fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Jack Waley-Cohen, a full-time quiz obsessive and question-setter for Only Connect. After the initial mapping was complete, they incorporated an error-correction algorithm, which places similar-sounding combinations a very long way apart. And then there was the question of language: using a team of linguists, what3words is now available in a couple of dozen tongues, from Arabic to Zulu. It has also grown from a company of three to now around 70 full-time employees after two multimillion-dollar rounds of venture capital. The challenge now is educating the world in their system. “We obviously aim to be a global standard,” Sheldrick says. To that end they have recently signed licensing agreements with companies including Mercedes, which will utilise the system in its A-class cars, including using voice activation, and TomTom, which will incorporate three-word commands in its navigation platforms. The technology also offers an off-the-shelf solution to the many countries that lack any kind of universal address system. Ten governments and their postal services – including Mongolia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Tuvalu – have signed up to the idea. “If you think about addresses,” Sheldrick says, “some are from centuries ago, some are from last week, but there is also so much of the world that has not engaged with that. And that can include where I live in rural Hertfordshire, to our office in London where the postcode does not point to the right place, to entire countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, which have just never known anything other than using directions.” Given that smartphones now have such wide penetration, he believes there is the opportunity to leapfrog conventional address systems. Sheldrick is watching the slow advance of his idea in travel guides and email signatures and Airbnb booking forms. The technology has already proved invaluable in disaster zones and refugee camps as well as at rock festivals. It could easily enable drone delivery. Earlier this month the lead GP on the Isle of Mull, Dr Brian Prendergast, sick of being unable to find his patients, requested they all sign up to it. Lyndsey Duff, the head of what3words’ two-woman South African office got quite emotional, she says, when she first heard about the possibilities of the technology two years ago. She was working at the time for the South African High Commission in London. There are many ways in which South Africa was historically divided but one of them, she suggests, “was always by maps”. While the whites-only areas of apartheid cities had street names, the black townships and rural villages like Relela were just inked in as grey spaces. “For me, what3words is the perfect balance of good business and doing good,” Duff says. She points to the fact that iStore – the South African equivalent of Apple Store – is now using what3words for its deliveries, as well as to the potential of projects like Gateway Health (which use the service for a nominal fee). Not only ecommerce, but also social progress is being held up by the absence of “last mile” technology that will take you where you need to get, Duff suggests. On the ground, that last mile can still be quite a hard sell. In Limpopo, as elsewhere, Gateway Health is faced with the question of how to make the technology go viral. Dr Louw believes it takes a village. His strategy is to use Relela as a pilot scheme for what3words, to show its positive impact on maternal health, and to use that case study to try to persuade regional and national government to adopt the address system as standard. In Relela, I joined him as he tried to sell the benefits to perhaps the toughest crowd of all, the village’s hereditary chief and councilmen, who have had plenty of white men from Johannesburg come here and tell them how they can improve the way they have always done things. The chief’s big brick house is at the top of a hill looking down the valley toward the Cloud Mountains. In late afternoon, we are invited to sit in his front yard, where benches have been set up for a council meeting under a large, spreading jacaranda tree. When Louw makes his pitch for every home in Relela to utilise a what3words address, he is met with silence. This, it is eventually explained, is because the council meeting does not yet have a quorum. We sit on the benches for a long, chill hour while the sun goes down, waiting for the other two councillors to come up the hill. Eventually when it is getting dark and six men are present, Louw repeats his pitch. Again, silence. I have a go. “If someone was to come to the village from outside,” I say, “how might they currently find the person they wanted to meet?” That’s simple, Hendrik Mowane, the council secretary, suggests. “The village is divided into zones, there are seven zones [each with about 4,000 people] and in each zone there is one man who knows the families there. The visitor would come to this man’s house and he would take them to the place.” “But,” I say, “what if a child was sick, and needed an ambulance. Or a woman was in distress, in labour? What if the zone leader was out?” The councilmen discuss these questions gravely. “Then that would be a problem,” Mowane concludes. Louw shows a video on his phone about how what3words might solve that problem. At this point, slowly, almost imperceptibly, a smile spreads across one or two of the councilmen’s faces. Another meeting is arranged, this one involving a big screen for the villagers, and lunch. On the way back down from the chief’s house, Louw suggests this is progress. He believes in a year or two the argument will be won, and there will be a team of community drivers on hand to get women like Eunice Sewaphe to hospital. “It is exciting times,” he insists. There are 139 villages like Relela in this region. But once Relela has addressed itself, then – neighbours being neighbours – he hopes the other 138 will follow. Beyond this valley, there are 4 billion people without an address. Perhaps technology can now put them on a map, three words at a time.

          "bodyText": "Here is a question you can bring up under Any Other Business at your next meeting: would all this be going better if the robots were in charge? To listen to the claims of some “artificial intelligence” evangelists, the answer to that question might be yes. In California IBM’s Project Debater machine has just achieved an honourable draw in debates with two actual human beings. While the humans scored well with facial and hand gestures – something that for now is still beyond Project Debater’s capabilities – the robot impressed with its grasp of data and use of evidence. Hearts may not have been moved but minds were swayed. Admittedly, many in the room were IBM staff, so the geek factor may have been unusually large on this occasion. Question Time this was not. Are there any limits to what the AI machines can do? Er, yes, there are limits. But it is impossible to deny that progress is being made, and rapidly too. First it was said that the subtleties of chess would make it impossible for the then (human) world champion to be beaten. Wrong. Then it was argued that the Chinese game of Go, far more complex still, would resist the rise of the robots. Wrong again. And now artificial intelligence is creating debaters to take on modern-day Ciceros and give them a run for their money. Why not unleash some of this AI brilliance into the boardroom, it is suggested. Get some cool analytical heads – or “heads” – on the case. Robots will not be influenced by emotional appeals. They will focus on facts and be objective about data. They will balance risk and reward decisions on the basis of probabilities. Sure, this might be less entertaining than an episode of The Apprentice, if that is the sort of thing you like. But maybe businesses and organisations would be better served by computational rigour at the top rather than subjective, bullying outbursts. It might have been preferable for Carillion’s employees, contractors and shareholders if an unflinching accountancy algorithm had been able to speak up and declare the board’s assessment of the company’s finances to be ridiculous. Computers do not have relationships to manage or careers to plot. They should be able to tell the unvarnished truth at all times. But there are one or two reasons why Project Debater may not quite be ready to take its place in the boardroom. First, it has a female voice – and we all know how welcome female voices are at the top of many FTSE companies. Perhaps it’s a good thing that these machines don’t have feelings. It might otherwise be a bit crushing for the computer to hear the traditional response: “Well, that’s a very interesting point, Project Debater. Perhaps one of the men would now like to make it so we can discuss it properly?” More seriously, we know that supposedly objective, dispassionate algorithms can in fact be shot through with the prejudices of the people who have written them. Garbage in still leads to garbage out. So you would have to be very careful how you deployed AI machinery anywhere near the decision-making process. You would still need a few grown-up humans nearby to supervise. What’s more, we shouldn’t get too carried away with what the IBM robot just did. Olivia Solon’s candid assessment for the Guardian was that “it lacked linguistic precision and argumentative clarity”. Similar criticisms have not prevented others from getting to the top of course. But could we accept this sort of thing from a machine for very long? Fragmented Trumpian sentences and chilly Maybot utterances do not exactly enthuse everybody, but at least these two figures are more or less recognisably human. Data isn’t everything when it comes to decision-making. Experience, intuition, hunches, imagination and judgment all matter too. Would AI have given us the Sony Walkman or the Apple Macintosh? I doubt it. Robots are pretty unimaginative. They could enhance or support human choices, however. As the writer Margaret Heffernan has observed: “Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the answer to genuine stupidity.” Man, woman and machine need to work together to solve our problems. But for the foreseeable future it will be a human being whose finger is on the machine’s off switch, and rightly so. • Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre"

          "bodyText": "The publisher of the Daily Mail has turned to Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News to poach a new chief editor for its websites. Noah Kotch, the editor-in-chief of Fox News Digital, has been named the new editor-in-chief of DailyMail.com and MailOnline. Kotch was previously the founding publisher of Heat Street – a website launched in 2016 by former Conservative MP Louise Mensch that closed in 2017 – and senior producer on NBC’s Today show for five years. He effectively replaces Martin Clarke, who will retain his role as the publisher of the DailyMail.com/MailOnline and Metro.co.uk, while taking on additional responsibility as the publisher of DMG Media’s flagship newspapers, the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro. “We look forward to him growing our editorial operation, particularly in the US and beyond,” said Clarke, who launched DailyMail.com in 2007 and has led the global expansion of MailOnline. “We have been very impressed with the transformation he has brought about at FoxNews.com over the past year.” Despite enormous success in the US under Clarke, the site recently reported a fall of almost 10% in global traffic, which it blamed in part on changes to Facebook’s algorithm. The latest shake-up followed the announcement earlier this month that Paul Dacre is to stand down in November as editor of the Daily Mail after 26 years at the helm, bringing to an end one of the most influential reigns in British journalism. Dacre had always sought to distance his print newspaper from its online stablemate. Dacre, 69, will remain with the company as chairman and editor-in-chief of DMG Media, the publishing arm of Lord Rothermere’s DMGT. The Mail on Sunday’s editor, Geordie Greig, has been named as the new editor of the Daily Mail, with Ted Verity, the deputy editor of the Daily Mail, taking over from him at the Mail on Sunday. The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday delivered income of £219m during the first six months of 2018, despite the Daily Mail’s circulation almost halving over the past 15 years, to 1.3m copies a day. MailOnline, which claims to be the most-read English-language news website in the world, with tens of millions of readers, brought in just £61m during the same period, albeit with a smaller cost base."

          "bodyText": "Abijeet Nath and Nilotpal Das were driving back from a visit to a waterfall in the Indian province of Assam earlier this month when they stopped in a village to ask for directions. The two men were pulled out of their car and beaten to death by a mob who accused them of stealing children. “The villagers got suspicious of the strangers as for the last three or four days messages were going around on WhatsApp, as well as through word of mouth, about child lifters roaming the area,” Mukesh Agrawal, a local police officer said. Indian police have linked dozens of murders and serious assaults to rumours spread on the messaging service in recent months. In Brazil, WhatsApp has been blamed for a yellow fever outbreak after being used to spread anti-vaccine videos and audio messages. In Kenya, WhatsApp group admins have been described as a major source of politically motivated fake news during recent elections. And there are signs that the messaging service is being used as a conduit for misinformation in the UK. New analysis by the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute found that consumers around the world are reading less news on Facebook and are increasingly turning to WhatsApp – which has 1.5 billion active users worldwide – to share and discuss news stories. “In some sense it’s not that dissimilar to ordinary conversations but what makes it different is the speed with which these things can spread,” said Nic Newman, who co-wrote the report. “The reasons why people are moving to these spaces is because they get more privacy. If you’re in an authoritarian regime you can use it to talk safely about politics – but it can also be used for nefarious means.” Newman said WhatsApp’s privacy settings make it difficult to ascertain the scale of misinformation on the service: “It’s very early days but I’ve got a hunch this is going to become a much bigger story.” WhatsApp lets users send messages, links, pictures and videos to other users. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, it has no algorithm deciding which content is shown to users, no ability for outside companies to buy adverts and discussion happens within private groups. This should in theory make it harder to manipulate and there is little chance of a large-scale Cambridge Analytica-style scandal. But its use of end-to-end encryption means that no one – not even the creators of the app – can intercept and monitor messages between users. This has angered government officials around the world – including in Britain – who want to have the ability to monitor potentially illegal behaviour. But it also makes it near-impossible for WhatsApp to intercept misinformation being shared. Even measuring how a story spreads on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook but run as an independent business, is nearly impossible. “People don’t want to put themselves in the public domain by putting something publicly on Facebook and Twitter, but there’s still need for humans to gossip and share communication,” said Camilla Wright, who has run the Popbitch email newsletter since 2000 and tracked the evolution ofonline gossip. “People are sending things to each other on email again and on WhatsApp,” she explained, drawing parallels with the round-robin letters and private forums that existed before Facebook and Twitter. “It’s much more in tune in with how humans have evolved to gossip because it feels like you’re telling people on a one-to-one level. The closed WhatsApp group is the modern water cooler or school gate.” The sense that news is being provided in secret by a friend – who got it from their friend, who claims to have got it from their friend, who claims to be in the know – is part of the appeal and only adds to the credibility of rumours. British users got a taste for this recently when a rumour spread that David and Victoria Beckham were about to announce their divorce. Much of the speculation, which was strongly denied by the Beckhams, came from a series of screengrabbed messages that spread through WhatsApp, allegedly from people in the PR industry who had the inside track. “My sister’s friends sister works in a PR agency in London and apparently they are pulling an all nighter tonight in advance,” claimed one of the widely distributed messages, with no supporting evidence. Another featured a now-suspended junior employee at London PR firm the Communications Store who used her work email to tell her family members that the “news is being broken in the papers today/tomorrow”. The agency has since made it clear that she was not the original source for the rumour and was only passing on gossip she had heard on Twitter. But taken together, the two images appeared to provide double-sourcing from people who could conceivably know the real story. Within hours they had been widely shared around the world, in an impossible-to-track manner. For its part the messaging service is aware that it is dealing with a growing problem, which has already prompted the growth of fact-checking services in countries such as Mexico. A WhatsApp spokesperson said some people used the app to spread harmful misinformation. “We’ve made it easy to block a phone number with just one tap – and are constantly evolving our tools to block automated content. We’re working to give people more control over private groups, which remain strictly limited in size. We’re also stepping up our education efforts so that people know about our safety features, as well as how to spot fake news and hoaxes.” But veterans of the online news business see the private nature of the service as being perfect for unmediated gossip. “People feel much more comfortable sharing important things through WhatsApp,” said Wright. “It’s that feeling of being in on a secret that people love.”"

          "bodyText": "In November of last year, I read an article in the New York Times about disturbing videos targeted at children that were being distributed via YouTube. Parents reported that their children were encountering knock-off editions of their favourite cartoon characters in situations of violence and death: Peppa Pig drinking bleach, or Mickey Mouse being run over by a car. A brief Google of some of the terms mentioned in the article brought up not only many more accounts of inappropriate content, in Facebook posts, newsgroup threads, and other newspapers, but also disturbing accounts of their effects. Previously happy and well-adjusted children became frightened of the dark, prone to fits of crying, or displayed violent behaviour and talked about self-harm – all classic symptoms of abuse. But despite these reports, YouTube and its parent company, Google, had done little to address them. Moreover, there seemed to be little understanding of where these videos were coming from, how they were produced – or even why they existed in the first place. I’m a writer and artist, with a focus on the broad cultural and societal effects of new technologies, and this is how most of my obsessions start: getting increasingly curious about something and digging deeper, with an eye for concealed infrastructures and hidden processes. It’s an approach that has previously led me to investigate Britain’s system of deportation flights or its sophisticated road surveillance network, and this time it took me into the weird, surreal, and often disturbing hinterland of YouTube’s children’s videos. And these videos are worrying on several levels. As I spent more and more time with them, I became perturbed not just by their content, but by the way the system itself seemed to reproduce and exacerbate their most unsavoury excesses, preying on children’s worst fears and bundling them up into nightmare playlists, while blindly rewarding their creators for increasing their view counts even as the videos themselves descended into meaningless parodies and nonsensical stories. For adults, it’s the sheer weirdness of many of the videos that seems almost more disturbing than their violence. This is the part that’s harder to explain – and harder for people to understand – if you don’t immerse yourself in the videos, which I’d hardly recommend. Beyond the simple knock-offs and the provocations exists an entire class of nonsensical, algorithm-generated content; millions and millions of videos that serve merely to attract views and produce income, cobbled together from nursery rhymes, toy reviews, and cultural misunderstandings. Some seem to be the product of random title generators, others – so many others – involve real humans, including young children, distributed across the globe, acting out endlessly the insane demands of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms, even if it makes no sense, even if you have to debase yourself utterly to do it. When I wrote an essay about the videos online, the public reaction largely mirrored my own. On the one hand, people were horrified to find out that these videos existed, and on the other, completely weirded out by the sheer scale and strangeness of what they found. The combination sent the article viral: it was shared and read online millions of times, picked up by websites and newspapers around the world, and even resulted in questions being asked in the European parliament. Finally, YouTube started to respond, although its efforts, and the results, have been mixed. YouTube’s initial proposal was to restrict advertising on disturbing content aimed at children – but its proposals failed to engage honestly with its own platform. It’s estimated that 400 hours of content are uploaded to the site every minute. Policing it by hand is impossible; instead, YouTube relies on flagging by viewers to drive official review – which is hardly suitable when the first people to view this stuff are small children, and the damage is already done. YouTube has also touted the technological cure-all of machine learning as its preferred solution – but in April, it finally agreed that the dedicated YouTube Kids app would switch to entirely human moderation, effectively admitting that the approach didn’t work. As a result, while many videos have since been removed from the website, uncountable numbers still remain. In March, Wired catalogued a slew of violent accounts and demonstrated that it was possible to go from a popular children’s alphabet video to a Minnie Mouse snuff film in 14 steps, just by following YouTube’s own recommendations. As of last week, Googling the title of one of the now-removed videos mentioned in the New York Times article (“PAW Patrol Babies Pretend to Die Suicide by Annabelle Hypnotized”) results in a link to a near-identical video still hosted on the site (“PAW PATROL Babies Pretend To Die MONSTER HANDS From MIRROR! Paw Patrol Animation Pups Save For Kids”), in which the adorable pups don a freakish clip-art monster mask to terrify one another before being lured off a rooftop by a haunted doll. Is “Save For Kids” supposed to read “Safe For Kids”? Either way, it is not, and it’s obvious that just playing whack-a-mole with search terms and banned accounts is never going to solve entangled problems of copyright infringement, algorithmic recommendation, and ad-driven monetary incentives on a billion-view platform with no meaningful human oversight. Whether these videos are deliberately malicious, “merely” trolling, or the emergent effect of complex systems, isn’t the point. What’s new is that the system in which such violence proliferates is right in front of us, and visibly complicit, if we choose to see it for what it is. I titled that original essay “Something is wrong on the internet” because it seemed and still seems to me that the issues made glaringly obvious by the scandal are not limited to children’s content, nor to YouTube. First among these is how systems of algorithmic governance, rather than leading us towards the sunny uplands of equality and empowerment, continually re-enact and reinforce our existing prejudices, while oppressing those with the least understanding of, and thus power over, the systems they’re enmeshed in. Take YouTube’s recommendation system for starters, which doesn’t differentiate between Disney movies and a grainy animation cooked up by a bot farm in China. Essentially what the seemingly benign “if you like that, you’ll like this” mechanism is doing is training young children – practically from birth – to click on the first thing that comes along, regardless of the source. This is the same mechanism that sees Facebook slide fake political ads and conspiracy theories into the feeds of millions of disaffected voters, and the outcome – ever more extreme content and divided viewpoints – is much the same. Add the sheer impossibility of working out where these videos come from (most are anonymous accounts with thousands of barely differentiated uploads) and the viewer is adrift in a sea of existential uncertainty, which starts to feel worryingly familiar in a world where opaque and unaccountable systems increasingly control critical aspects of our everyday lives. We’ve seen how computer programs designed to provide balanced sentencing recommendations in US courts were more prone to mistakenly label black defendants as likely to reoffend – wrongly flagging them at almost twice the rate as that for white people (45% to 24%). We’ve seen how algorithmic systems target men over women for prestigious employment positions: in one study, Google’s ad system showed the highest-paying jobs 1,852 times to men — but just 318 times to a female group with the same preferences. And we’ve also seen how hard it is to appeal against these systems. When the Australian government instituted “robo-debt”, an automated debt-recovery programme, it wrongly and illegally penalised the most vulnerable in society, who had no recourse to support or advice to challenge the system. In the months since first writing about YouTube’s weird video problem, I’ve met a few people from the company, as well as from other platforms that have been caught up in similar vortices. While most are well-meaning, few seem to have much of a grasp of the wider structural issues in society which their systems both profit from and exacerbate. Like most people who work at big tech companies, they think that these problems can be solved by the application of more technology: by better algorithms, more moderation, heavier engineering. Many outside the tech bubble – particularly in the west and in higher income brackets – are simply appalled that anyone would let their kids use YouTube in the first place. But we won’t fix these issues by blaming the companies, or urging them do better, just as we won’t solve the obesity crisis by demonising fast food but by lifting people out of poverty. If YouTube is bridging a gap in childcare, the answer is more funding for childcare and education in general, not fixing YouTube. What’s happening to kids on YouTube, to defendants in algorithmically enhanced court trials, and to poor debtors in Australia, is coming for all of us. All of our jobs, life support systems, and social contracts are vulnerable to automation – which doesn’t have to mean actually being replaced by robots, but merely being at their mercy. YouTube provides another salutary lesson here: only last week it was reported that YouTube’s most successful young stars – the “YouTubers” followed and admired by millions of their peers – are burning out and breaking down en masse. Polygon magazine cited, among many others, the examples of Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, the third most popular YouTuber in the world with just under 30 million subscribers, who recently went live to talk to his viewers about fears of an impending breakdown and his decision to take a break from YouTube, and Elle Mills, a popular YouTuber with 1.2 million followers, who posted footage of herself mid-anxiety attack in a video entitled Burn Out at 19. It would be easy to scoff at these young celebrities, were it not for the fact that their experience is merely the most charismatic example of the kind of algorithmic employment under which many others already labour. The characteristics, after all, are the same: long hours without holidays, benefits, or institutional support, and the pressure to work at the pace of the machine in a system whose goals and mechanisms are unclear and ever-changing, and to which its subjects have no appeal. (In a depressing twist, many of these same YouTubers have been hit by declines in revenue caused directly by YouTube’s attempts to demonetise “inappropriate” content for children – solving one problem in the system only exacerbates others.) The weirdness of YouTube videos, the extremism of Facebook and Twitter mobs, the latent biases of algorithmic systems: all of these have one thing in common with the internet itself, which is that – with a few dirty exceptions – nobody intentionally designed them this way. This is perhaps the strangest and most salutary lesson we can learn from these examples, if we choose to learn at all. The weirdness and violence they produce seems to be in direct correlation to how little we understand their workings – and how much is hidden from us, deliberately or otherwise, by the demands of efficiency and ease of use, corporate and national secrecy, and sheer, planet-spanning scale. We live in an age characterised by the violence and breakdown of such systems, from global capitalism to the balance of the climate. If there is any hope for those exposed to its excesses from the cradle, it might be that they will be the first generation capable of thinking about global complexity in ways that increase, rather than reduce, the agency of all of us.

          "bodyText": "The public is increasingly forgoing Facebook as a news source and using WhatsApp to share and discuss stories with friends and family, according to a new report on the state of the media. “Consumers are being put off by ‘toxic’ debates and unreliable news. They are also finding that alternative networks offer more convenience, greater privacy and less opportunity to be misunderstood. As a result they are moving discussion to messaging apps where they can be sure they are talking to ‘real friends’,” says the report from the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Many publishers have noted a growing importance afforded private WhatsApp groups for distributing news and information. This change raises enormous challenges for news outlets and fact checkers, since the service is encrypted and it is almost impossible to monitor how articles are being shared and correct any spread of misinformation. It could also prove to be another regulatory headache for Facebook, since Mark Zuckerberg’s company also owns WhatsApp in addition to its flagship social network. The seventh annual Digital News Report, from the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which is based an online YouGov survey of 74,000 people in 37 countries, show substantial changes in the news landscape over the last year. The fallout from the 2016 US presidential election has continued to affect the actions of social media businesses and consumers. The report found that use of WhatsApp for news has almost tripled since 2014 and overtaken Twitter in importance in many countries, especially among younger users. In some countries, such as Malaysia and Turkey, the encryption makes it a far safer place than Facebook for individuals wanting to discuss political issues without attracting the attention of the authorities. By comparison, the percentage of people using Facebook to get news has fallen from 42% in 2016 to 36% today. Usage of the social network for other purposes has not fallen substantially, suggesting people are simply seeing the impact of the social network’s recent efforts to reduce the amount of low-quality news on the site in favour of content posted by family and friends. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor and one of the report’s editors, said the public still tended to blame news publishers rather than social networks for the “long-standing crisis of confidence” in the media industry. “Much of the public does not feel it can trust the news, especially in countries with highly polarised politics and where many media are vulnerable to undue economic or political influence,” he said. The Reuters Institute research concluded that British media consumption was still dominated by BBC News, although the Guardian website was the second most popular online news website, just ahead of MailOnline. It also found growing awareness in the UK for niche campaigning left-wing websites supportive of Jeremy Corbyn, such as The Canary, and Another Angry Voice, but warned that changes to Facebook’s algorithm “could see these alternative websites struggle to retain attention”. The social network is known to be refining its algorithm to take greater account of how much users trust various news sites. There was less positive news for news outlets attempting to make money from internet content. Just 7% of Britons said they had paid for online news in the last year, one of the lowest rankings in the world, compared to 20% of Australians and almost a third of people in Norway. Most of the respondents to the survey erroneously believed that the majority of online news outlets made money. However, the survey found readers were much more likely to pay for a news subscription or give a donation if they were an informed that an outlet needed the income to cover costs."

          "bodyText": "Gregory Rakoczy was asleep in his van at a Maryland campsite when six police officers knocked on his door. A fellow camper had Googled his name and found a mugshot indicating he was a felon on the run. He was not. Rakoczy was arrested and held for 20 hours. Afterward he immediately Googled his own name and found that his picture had recently gone up on Mugshots.com for criminal charges he had faced 15 years ago. At that time Rakoczy ran a company that installed audiovisual equipment in homes. He was charged with fraud after his firm sold dozens of clients one model of TV but installed a different one – a mistake he said was made by a distributor, but one he should have noticed. Most of the 90 charges – one for every person sold the wrong TV – were dismissed after he replaced the TVs, and he spent five years on probation for the remaining ones. He contacted Mugshots.com to take the picture down and they demanded $399, which he paid. But the next day he saw his picture was still on the site and he called them again. “They told me it was $399 for every charge,” he said. He refused and the mugshot has haunted him ever since. Rakoczy is one of a growing number of people demanding that lawmakers and search engines do more to clamp down on the predatory industry that has emerged around mugshots. It’s a complex debate that raises questions about public records in a digital age, shame culture and the responsibility of platforms like Google. Last month the alleged owners of Mugshots.com, one of dozens of sites that publish booking photos and demand payment for their removal, were arrested on charges of extortion, money laundering and identity theft. But the site remains online, along with dozens of others like it. “It’s really a good sign that finally they’ve been able to get charges against some of the people behind these sites,” said Paolo Cirio, an artist and activist who has dedicated the last few years to campaigning against mugshot extortion. “But it’s a small drop in the ocean.” Since that incident in May 2012, Rakoczy, who is now an author, has been falsely detained six more times – at the beach, at dinner with his editor, at three other campsites and most recently, in November 2017, he was detained while dining with friends in Alabama. In every case, someone had Googled his name and seen the outdated and inaccurate mugshot record that appears among the top results. “I’m an old school New Yorker, so every time I am introduced to somebody I say my own name. But then I think ‘oh crap, I’m going to get a knock on my door in 24 hours’,” said Rakoczy, who recently finished his first novel. Eroding the presumption of innocence At a federal level, mugshots are not considered public records; they are deemed to be an unwarranted invasion of privacy. But since the early 2000s, local law enforcement agencies in every state – with the exception of Georgia –have shared digital booking photos on their websites as a public notification service. According to Eumi Lee, a UC Hastings law professor, this shift to the internet transformed mugshots of ordinary citizens from “public records that generally fell into ‘practical obscurity’” into “commodities posted for entertainment and commercial gain”. Many of the government websites were designed not to be indexed by Google and kept updated. However, sites like Mugshots.com, Busted Newspaper, and Arrests.org, as well as state-level ones like Florida.arrests.org and Phoenixmugs.com, scrape these sites or submit freedom of information requests to get hold of millions of booking records. The sites then use search engine optimisation techniques to ensure the mugshots rank highly in Google search results – even if the charges were subsequently dropped or the person was arrested due to mistaken identity or law enforcement error. Not only do these pages humiliate their subjects, but they also damage their chance of finding a job, housing or even potential dates because mugshots create a powerful visual association between the subject and criminal activity, regardless of guilt. (The association is deemed so powerful that courts try to avoid showing mugshots to juries to avoid prejudice.) Beyond the mugshot sites, there’s an entire ecosystem that profits from the humiliation of those arrested, including reputation management firms, mugshot removal services, media companies that publish mugshot galleries and search engines like Google. It can be a lucrative business. The founders of Mugshots.com are accused of extorting at least 5,703 individuals in the US to rake in more than $2.4m. “These websites have made people live in terror of their digital reputation,” said Sarah Lageson, a sociologist who studies the criminal justice system. “People opt out of society and avoid social situations that might result in Google search.” ‘My reputation is everything’ Kim (not her real name), a Canadian in her 30s who runs her own design company, is scared that prospective clients might see her mugshot, which was taken after a violent – and what she alleges was wrongful – arrest as she was leaving a gay bar in Florida in 2014. Police officers were trying to move the crowd along, but Kim had become separated from her friend so took shelter in a doorway. She explained to a nearby police officer why she was waiting, but he insisted she move. She opened her mouth to protest and within seconds, she alleges, the police officer grabbed her wrist and spun her into the cuff position, slamming her face into the door. “My eye was split open, my face pressed against the glass with blood streaming down my face,” she said. “All the people in the crowd started screaming ‘police brutality’.” Kim was taken to hospital for several stitches above her left eye (the Guardian has seen photos of her injuries) before being taken to jail where she was charged with resisting arrest. The charges were dropped days later. About a month after the incident, Kim’s lawyer called her to say her photo had been posted online. She turned to Google in a panic. Although her charges were dismissed weeks before, her battered face was staring back at her from several mugshot websites. “It was mortifying. I’d just started my own company and my reputation is everything,” she said, adding that she feels “revictimised” every time she sees the picture. She started to pay fees of between $200 and $450 to remove photos. Each time her photo was taken down from one site it would pop up on another. It was an expensive game of whack-a-mole. “I spent $3,000 in total before realising it was a big scam. The second they see you are sucker enough to pay for one it’s up the next day on another,” she said. Kim had the resources to hire lawyers and pay the take-down fees, but many aren’t. “We know that people who are not white and people who are poor or mentally ill are disproportionately more likely to be arrested,” Lageson said. “Mugshots are simply a reflection of police discretion.” Google’s responsibility The Italian activist Paolo Cirio, who launched a campaign group called Right2Remove, wants Google to either de-index the mugshot websites or massively down-rank them in search results – offering Americans a similar right to those in Europe, where there is a regulation granting the “right to be forgotten”. “Google is the gatekeeper. It would be great if they acknowledged that these websites are bad actors and demoted them,” he said. Google has down-ranked mugshot websites in the past. In response to a 2013 New York Times article, Google tweaked its algorithm to dramatically reduce the sites’ prominence in search results. Since then, the sites appear to have worked around the changes and bubbled back to the top. “We recognise that this is a sensitive issue,” said a Google spokeswoman. “Since 2013, we have had systems that work to decrease the visibility of mugshots for searches for people’s names, while being careful not to inadvertently suppress information that is in the public interest, such as sheriff department sites or sex offender registries.” It’s a tricky problem because even if the mugshots websites are down-ranked, if an arrestee doesn’t have much of a digital presence their mugshot may still be the first result when someone Googles their name. Cirio argues that Google is dragging its feet over the issue because it gets paid a small fee every time someone clicks on an ad for the reputation management companies that appear when people search for “remove mugshot” or something similar. In light of Google’s recent decisions to ban advertising for bail bonds and high-interest payday loans, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume they could extend the ban to mugshot extortion sites. And some point to how the company has taken a strong line with other types of photo-based extortion such as revenge porn. Google said it bans content that “seeks to exploit others”, which includes extortion and blackmail. However, searches reveal it still features many ads promising to remove mugshots for a fee, including one that imitates an official Google website. Some members of Cirio’s group are taking matters into their own hands, using the dark arts of search engine optimisation and cyber-sleuthing to identify the people who run the sites and attempt to tarnish their reputation online. For others, regulation is the only solution. So far, 18 states have introduced laws to ban removal fees or insist on accurate postings. However, these still place all the burden on the individual to find their mugshots online, contact the company with proof of the status of their case, and negotiate the removal of the picture. Eumi Lee proposes a different solution: excluding mugshots from the public records, except when there is a specific law enforcement need or by court order. “We are at such a pivotal mark in terms of criminal justice reform and also at this point of starting to fear the commercialisation of consumer and government data,” the law professor said. “Society must recognise the greater privacy interests at stake in the digital era.” Rakoczy remains pragmatic. “I am not trying to hide the fact I was arrested, but I have a problem with everyone having such easy access and these sites wanting a buttload of money to take it down.” Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com"

          "headline": "Uber developing technology that would tell if you're drunk",
          "bodyText": "Uber may be working on technology which would detect if users of its app are drunk or high. A patent application from the company, revealed this week, outlines a system that would be able to identify if someone is displaying uncharacteristic behaviour by looking at small changes in their behaviour as they use the Uber app. The patent includes a list of potential data Uber could use to determine an app user’s level of inebriation. This includes walking speed, unusual typos made while inputting a ride request, the angle at which a user holds the phone and whether the phone is swaying. While the patent application doesn’t spell out that the proposed tool would be used to identify if someone is drunk or on drugs – it refers instead to “‘predicting user state using machine learning” and “uncharacteristic user states” – that would be the most likely interpretation. If the theoretical AI system does detect that someone is acting in an unusual way it will tailor Uber’s services accordingly. The patent application suggests ways Uber might tailor its services, such as directing users to a better-lit pickup point, for example, or matching users with a driver who has been trained to deal with drunk passengers. Uber says it may also use the technology to prevent users from pooling with other passengers. While working on special safety measures for intoxicated passengers sounds helpful, the patent application shines a light on the scope of Uber’s current data collection methods, and poses questions about the potential for data like this to be abused. The startup very publicly turned over a new leaf with the resignation of the scandal-ridden co-founder Travis Kalanick and the appointment of Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO last year, but it has a murky history when it comes to its customer data. Uber’s notorious “God View” tool, for example, which showed the location of users who had requested a car, was abused by employees to track the location of their exes as well as monitor celebrities and politicians, according to an October 2016 court declaration by Uber’s former forensic investigator, Samuel Ward Spangenberg. There’s also the worry that the system might put drunk users in danger. According to a recent CNN investigation, at least 103 Uber drivers in the US have been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the past four years, and many of these victims were drunk. And a tool like this could be misused when it comes to charging customers. Uber’s pricing strategy is something of a black box; nobody knows exactly how their algorithm works, but the company does seem to have a lot of insights about when its customers are likely to pay more. In 2016, for example, a behavioral scientist at Uber said that the company knew that people were more willing to pay a higher fare when their phone batteries were low, but was careful to say that they “absolutely don’t use that” information. One imagines that drunk passengers are also likely to be less cautious about how much money they’re spending. There is no evidence that Uber’s patent application is anything other than theoretical at the moment. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But there’s nothing to say they’re not already analysing this data. Uber has not said whether it are collecting this kind of data already, but the company has not been adverse to building user profiles in the past. In 2014 Uber used passenger data to demonstrate which US city had the highest incidence of one-night stands"

In the study, the software was able to accurately detect cancer in 95% of images of cancerous moles and benign spots, whereas a team of 58 dermatologists was accurate 87% of the time. An algorithm for prostate cancer Chinese researchers have developed an algorithm that can diagnose prostate cancer as accurately as a pathologist. Research leader Hongqian Guo of Nanjing University said: “[This] will help pathologists make better, faster diagnoses, as well as eliminating the day-to-day variation in judgment that can creep into human evaluations.” Targeting head and neck tumours Researchers at the University of Texas, Houston, have developed software to accurately contour the shape of head and neck cancer tumours. In studies, trained physicians have been shown to make widely varying evaluations of tumour volume. This software enables radiation oncologists to target their treatment more accurately, particularly critical in these types of cancers because of other vulnerable tissue located nearby. Colorectal cancer Scientists from Yokohama, Japan, have developed software that can detect colorectal cancer in its earliest stages with 86% accuracy. This type of cancer is often difficult to locate before the tumours become malignant and deadly, as cancerous cells enter the bloodstream, so early detection is critical. Breast cancer Researchers at Imperial College London are working with DeepMind Health to develop AI-based techniques to improve the accuracy of breast cancer screening. By studying 7,500 anonymised mammograms, they hope to create software that will reduce overdiagnosis and false positives. They aim to report their findings later this year."

Almost two years after the company fired its “trending” news team and replaced it with algorithms in an attempt to fight accusations of anti-conservative editing, it posted the job listings on Thursday. The adverts said Facebook was looking to hire “individuals with a passion for journalism, who believe in Facebook’s mission of making the world more connected”. “As a member of the team, you’ll be tasked with developing a deep expertise in Facebook’s News Credibility Program,” applicants were told. “You’ll be conducting investigations against predefined policies.” After initial media reports about the adverts, Facebook took them down briefly before reposting them with minor tweaks. The job title is now given as “news publisher specialist”, and all references to the company’s news credibility programme have been removed except for the URL, which remains the same. Also gone is the requirement for a “passion for journalism”. The two jobs advertised would be based at Facebook’s head office, and one requires fluency in Spanish. Work would involve, among other duties, creating lists of credible news organisations used across the site. i The job adverts take Facebook’s attempts to manage news on its platform full circle. At the beginning of 2016, the company’s “trending” module was pulled together by editors, who merged its internal data on what was being shared with stories published on a variety of mainstream media sources. In an effort to cut down on hoaxes, Facebook reportedly required editors to check respectable news organisations before pushing a story to the trending section, a move that prompted complaints of leftwing bias from US conservatives, who complained that the list included sites such as the New York Times and CNN but not Breitbart or the Washington Examiner. In August 2016, the Guardian broke the news that Facebook had responded to the attacks by firing all of the human editors and replacing them with an algorithm. The trending module became home to hoax stories within days, marking the beginning of Facebook’s troubles with “fake news” that would come to define the US election and aftermath. Last week, Facebookannounced the closure of the trending section altogether. The company is now seeking a new approach to its platform, de-prioritising news in favour of stories from friends and family, while more aggressively seeking to support news from “trusted” outlets and working out ways to directly suppress the spread of hoaxes and fakes. A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: “We’re working on how we more effectively identify and differentiate news and news sources across our platform. For instance, we recently announced the Archive of Ads with Political Content, where we’ll build separate treatments for both news and non-news content.”"

          "bodyText": "Do you find it hard to relax and switch off because you spend so much time on your phone? You just need to download another app. The popular New Zealand station Sleep Radio, which plays ambient music to help its listeners doze off, is now available on smartphones, to help people who use their devices late at night. Listeners have been tuning in from around the world. Meanwhile, Apple has announced a suite of new tools for the next iPhone operating system that allow you to set time limits on how much you use particular apps, and quieten the flood of notifications. Apple’s new system is called Screen Time, while Google, which plans similar features for its next Android phone operating system, speaks of “digital wellbeing”, a particularly sinister marketing buzzphrase. Is there a new kind of digitally enabled wellbeing that is somehow more exciting than boring old analogue wellbeing, of the sort you might experience while looking at a tree? I’d better install something that lets me experience it. Neither company, of course, really wants you to use its products any less. It was recently reported, indeed, that Apple is quietly looking to make more money from targeted advertising, since growth in iPhone sales has slowed. It is in the interest of both corporations to have you looking at ads for as many hours of the day as humanly possible. At the same time, they are aware of big tech’s increasingly tarnished reputation since the Snowden revelations and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Studies link social-media use to anxiety and depression, and a movement is growing in Silicon Valley called Time Well Spent, which calls for more humane design that reduces the time we spend on devices. (Earlier this year, citing Time Well Spent, Facebook changed its newsfeed in a way that supposedly encourages users to spend less time on the site while having more fun.) Rather than wait for sterner regulation to be foisted on them, Apple and Google are going on a PR offensive to seem concerned about their users. Rather than solving the underlying problems themselves, however, they are shunting on to us yet more soul-sucking digital management busywork. The real paradox here remains that of trying to help people be less addicted to products that are engineered to be as addictive as possible. Smartphones, social media sites and the like are full of design decisions – such as pull-to-refresh, or infinite scrolling – that actively hijack the brain’s reward system. They create what the behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, in his studies of animal conditioning, called a schedule of “intermittent reinforcement”, which he found was a very good way to maintain a particular behaviour in lab rats. Now we are all lab rats, desperately pawing the lever in our digital Skinner boxes in the hope of the next crunchy info-pellet. Even the mere knowledge that your smartphone might buzz with a new message while you are doing something else has been found to disrupt attention. Few people have the psychic fortitude to follow the example of the technology critic Evgeny Morozov, who locks his internet router and phone in a safe when he wants to do some work. Given all this, the promise that new functions in these machines will help us break our addictions might seem rather cynical. It’s as though every pack of cigarettes came with free nicotine patches. Still, what else are we going to do? The idea of just not using our tech so much is unthinkable. Better to trust that, as Homer Simpson said of alcohol, technology is the cause of, and solution to, all life’s problems. And the paradigm of tech actively helping you not to use it could profitably be extended to other areas. Tinder could do the drudge work of rejecting boorish suitors with an algorithm that writes your brush-offs for you. Uber could refuse to take you to the pub and suggest the walk would do you good. And rather than autoplaying the next episode in the series you are binging on, Netflix could sternly tell you it’s 2.30am, that you are slumped on the sofa covered in crisps and really should go to bed now, and then turn itself off. I could go on, but my laptop has just warned me that I’ve exceeded my sarcasm quota for the morning. • Steven Poole is the author of Rethink, You Aren’t What You Eat, Unspeak, and Trigger Happy"

          "headline": "New Daily Mail editor to be Geordie Greig",
          "bodyText": "Geordie Greig is to be the new editor of the Daily Mail, putting a staunch remainer in charge of one of the most pro-Brexit newspapers in the country. The current Mail on Sunday boss will replace Paul Dacre, 69, who is stepping down in November. Lord Rothermere, who controls the two papers, said: “Geordie has been an outstanding editor of the Mail on Sunday, and I am delighted that he will continue the high-quality journalism that Paul has made a hallmark of the Daily Mail for more than 25 years.” A source with knowledge of the discussions told the Guardian that Greig’s appointment was part of a process of “detoxifying the Daily Mail” after Dacre’s editorship. Any change to the Daily Mail’s editorial line on Brexit could have substantial implications for the government. Under Dacre’s leadership, the paper has launched ferocious front-page attacks on public figures who it deems to have challenged the decision to leave the EU. One labelled high court judges “enemies of the people”, another urged Theresa May to “crush the saboteurs” with an early election, and a recent attack on the House of Lords described them as “dinosaurs in ermine”. The paper is regularly the focus of morning news meetings in Downing Street, while Dacre was an early and consistent backer of May’s policies. Greig, 57, however, has repeatedly clashed with Dacre during his stint at the Mail on Sunday. Staff at both papers expressed surprise at the idea the two editors would be able to work together during the transition period, saying there was no love lost between them. The sister news outlets frequently battled during the Brexit campaign, and Greig’s Mail on Sunday has often gone out of its way to rubbish the daily paper’s scoops. Under the new arrangement, according to a company insider, it is expected the two papers will work much closer together, which could result in cost savings and opens the door to potential job cuts. Greig has been in his current position since 2012, having previously edited the London Evening Standard and Tatler magazine. Ted Verity, the deputy editor of the Daily Mail, will take control of the Sunday edition. Greig will have three challenges as Daily Mail editor: keeping the newspaper influential among politicians; ensuring it continues to make money in the face of declining circulation; and stepping out of the shadow of a man who has held the job for a quarter of a century. Dacre’s commitment to the job will be hard to match, according to Adrian Addison, the author of the book Mail Men, an unauthorised history of the newspaper. “He’s a tyrant. He’s a bully. He’s hands-on,” Addison said. “When he first became editor, he would get so wound up near edition time he used to behave like a gorilla and scratch himself so hard that his back would bleed. The blood would come through his shirt. That’s the wound-up tension.” Addison insists that Dacre – one of the most divisive individuals in the newspaper industry – has an impressive understanding of his audience. “He has a natural affinity with the lower middle-class reader. He doesn’t communicate with many members of the public – everything is purely gut instinct and surrounding himself with people who he listens to.” The financial analyst Ian Whittaker, who covers the fortunes of the papers’ parent company DMGT for Liberum Capital, warned against too much change. “From their standpoint, they probably want to keep the formula of a winning product, so I wouldn’t expect that much change in terms of direction of the Mail.” Whittaker speculated that giving the job to Greig could constitute a risk to the Daily Mail’s income unless the editor was willing to compromise on his political views. “You don’t want what happened to the Express 20 years ago,” said Whittaker, referring to when the Mail and the Express were locked in a battle for readers. “The Express decided to support Tony Blair, it annoyed its readership, and its circulation took a hit.” Greig, however, has form for bold gestures. When the old Etonian took over the Evening Standard in 2009, he issued a series of advertisements saying “sorry” to Londoners for the previous editor’s coverage. Behind the scenes, there is much discussion of the role played by the Rothermere family, who have a controlling interest in DMGT, especially the current owner’s wife, Lady Rothermere. It has been suggested the Daily Mail’s relentless pro-Brexit stance has become increasingly problematic among their social circle in Wiltshire, where they built a modern country house and mix with the likes of the fashion designer Jasper Conran. “[Greig] was parachuted in by Rothermere because he’s very good friends with Lady Rothermere – he’s a courtier,” claimed Addison. Greig will inherit a highly profitable print outfit which, together with its Sunday counterpart, delivered income of £219m during the first six months of 2018, despite the Daily Mail’s circulation almost halving over the last 15 years, to sit at 1.3m copies a day. By comparison, MailOnline, which claims to be the biggest English-language news website in the world with tens of millions of readers, brought in just £61m during the same period, albeit with a smaller cost base. Despite enormous success in the US under the editor Martin Clarke, the site recently reported a fall in traffic, which it blamed in part on changes to Facebook’s algorithm. Daily Mail insiders played down the possibility that the print edition, which until now has fiercely guarded its identity, could merge with the celebrity-obsessed MailOnline website in the near future, although there is the possibility that they could work together more closely. “I wouldn’t work on the assumption there are necessarily massive changes planned,” said one source. “But at the same time that doesn’t mean they won’t happen, because once new people are appointed they may decide there are things they want to do.”"

          "bodyText": "It was “Be nice to Chris Grayling” day. And Theresa May’s contribution was to express solidarity with her transport secretary by proving she was every bit as out of her depth as he is. Hopeless, indecisive and confused barely covers it. On days like these, cabinet meetings must resemble a convention of zombies fighting over the only functioning brain cell in the room. The best that can be said about it is that at least it is giving the rest of the world a laugh. It’s just a shame for those of us stuck in the UK who have to live with it. Prime minister’s questions is turning into a breeze for Jeremy Corbyn. Where previously he used to overthink things – admittedly not hard in his case – and tie himself up in knots with his own logic, he now just stands up and says, “how’s it going?” As even May is just about sentient enough to realise that “badly” won’t quite cut it, she has no answer. Because she genuinely doesn’t know. There is no area of government policy over which she has a firm grasp. Least of all Brexit. The Labour leader bounced to his feet and demanded to know if the government was going to publish the long-delayed white paper on its negotiating position before the Commons voted on the Lords amendments to the Brexit withdrawal bill next Tuesday. As it might be quite handy. If not essential to anyone hoping to make an informed decision. May’s eyes rotated in opposite directions and her mouth opened and shut as if gasping for breath while struggling for words. “I agree that we want to publish a white paper,” she croaked eventually. The snag was that no one in the cabinet could agree on what should go in it. Or when it should be published. The white paper remained defiantly white. “OK,” said Corbyn, generously choosing to give her another chance. If she wasn’t going to publish the white paper before next Tuesday could she at least promise to do so before the European council meeting? She couldn’t. It was far better that our negotiators were kept entirely in the dark. If they didn’t know what the government’s position was there was no chance of Johnny Foreigner second-guessing and outmanoeuvring us. That was the highpoint of the exchanges. May didn’t even know if the Brexit sub-subcommittees on maximum facilitation and the customs partnership had even met, let alone reached any conclusions. She couldn’t explain how her 10-mile buffer zone on the Irish border was going to work. There again, no one can as it’s a completely idiotic idea. In desperation May went to her default PMQs algorithm and demanded that Labour come up with solutions of their own. If he had had any, Corbyn might have been tempted to list them. But he didn’t, so he merely pointed out that it wasn’t the opposition doing the Brexit negotiations, before adding that the government didn’t appear to think it was its job to conduct the negotiations either. By now the Tory benches were almost entirely silent. There was a time, when May first became prime minister, that they thought her evasiveness and general air of uselessness was a sophisticated act. A means of luring opponents into a false sense of security. That moment has long passed and Conservative backbenchers have come to realise that behind her veneer of incompetence are only deeper and deeper layers of incompetence. Futility piled on futility. Corbyn ended by comparing the chaos of Brexit to the train wreck of the railways. At the mention of the word railways, Chris Grayling, who had spent PMQs in the recovery position near the speaker’s chair, jerked into life, his eyes full of terror. He just about managed to control the spasms in his neck but his head wobbled rhythmically. Failing Grayling isn’t in a good way and it would be a kindness if he was kept out of sight for a while. A kindness both to the country as well as him. With the prime minister now unable to remember her own name or what she was even doing in the chamber, the Tories’ Chris Davies tried to distract her by asking if she would be happy to sponsor a pigeon. “Yes,” she said. It was the only straight answer she gave all day. The unlucky pigeon was tearing its feathers out."

          "bodyText": "Near the end of April, Uber dropped a “fireside chat” podcast on to its “partner” channel on SoundCloud. It featured representatives of UberENGAGE (the company’s scheme for soliciting feedback from its drivers) doing a little soul-searching about the taxi app’s toxic public image. Back in 2014, the Guardian had been asking if Uber was the “worst company in Silicon Valley”, and that was before the sexual harassment lawsuits, the #DeleteUber campaign, the employment tribunals over its failure to pay the UK’s minimum wage, Transport for London (TfL) refusing to renew its licence and the forced resignation of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, last June. On the podcast, Uber London’s marketing strategy boss, Irina Kondrashova, conceded that the company had some “reputational challenges”. But she promised that Uber would come out fighting. “You probably haven’t seen much advertising for Uber in the last six months or so because rebuilding reputation is not just what you say but how you say it,” she said. “Shouting with billboards about how great we are doesn’t feel like the right thing right now. But I have some great news in that [over] the next couple of months we’re going to have some great campaigns coming out.” Uber was ready “to start telling people what we’re about and how we’re doing the right thing and ultimately changing our reputation”. If you are one of the four million or so people in Britain with an Uber account, you may well have seen the results pop up in your inbox recently. Uber has produced a six-part mini-documentary series called Where to, Britain? in collaboration with All 4. It follows Uber drivers and riders in six cities, in an attempt to position hailing an Uber as just another quirky bit of British life – complete with jaunty incidental music and a narration from Dawn French. In the first five-minute-long episode, a driver called Ali picks up the Manchester United players Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford and Axel Tuanzebe. In the next instalment, Elshan in Bristol picks up a couple of female graffiti artists. “All people featured are genuine Uber users,” says the disclaimer. “While their stories are real, the journeys were created for your enjoyment.” It’s not Uber’s only paradigm-melting marketing strategy. In recent weeks, PRs have pitched to the press the story of one heroic driver with paramedic training who assisted a birth in his car, while another publicity-savvy driver, 53-year-old Manuel Dias, told the Sun last week that Benedict Cumberbatch had jumped out of his Uber to prevent a mugging. Uber was also reportedly among the companies ready to a sign a £500,000 commercial deal with George Osborne’s London Evening Standard to secure “money-can’t-buy” coverage. The Standard has denied the story – but Osborne’s editorship had already raised conflict-of-interest-related questions. In the light of the London mayor Sadiq Khan’s Uber “ban” last year, Osborne published an editorial in defence of Uber that failed to note that one of his other jobs is a £650,000-a-year advisory role at the US fund manager BlackRock, a major Uber investor. He and David Cameron were also noted defenders of the gig economy while in power. Over in Paris, Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has revealed plans to launch a fleet of flying taxis. And in the US, Uber has appointed the self-described “force of nature in fierce stilettos” Bozoma Saint John as its chief brand officer. “Is this the woman who will save Uber?” asked the New York Times, atop a breathless profile that detailed how the Uber board member Arianna Huffington headhunted Saint John from Apple’s Beats Music. “I felt like she has this incredible capacity for intimacy and for sharing her story and for sharing others’ stories,” Huffington said. “She’s great at social media.” When asked if it wasn’t a little calculating of Uber to hire an African American single mother to repair its image, Saint John responded: “Being present as a black woman – just present – is enough to help exact some of the change that is needed and some that we’re looking for.” It seems unlikely that she can exact the sort of change that some of the 70,000 or so British Uber “driver partners” are fighting for, which is basic recognition of their rights as workers. Uber has lost two court cases brought against it by former drivers Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, who argued that they were entitled to minimum wage and sick pay. Uber plans to challenge them for a third time. (On the UberENGAGE podcast, one of the company’s legal team, Jonathan Ollivent, complains about the “various obligations” that this puts on Uber. “I don’t know if you’ve read the court order, but it’s really emotive. It’s really nasty about us and the way we work.”) But for Farrar – a member of the IWGB, an independent trade union whose members are predominantly low-paid workers in London – Uber’s “PR shenanigans” amount to little more than an effort to distract users from the fact that the rides are so cheap essentially because it has used 21st-century technology to erode 20th-century workers’ rights. “The point of departure has got to be Uber agreeing to pay the minimum wage to workers. If they can’t deliver that, then what good is all the rest of this stuff?” His argument is that Uber drivers are not in some fancy new category invented by the whiz-kids of Silicon Valley. They are workers (defined legally as “limb (b) workers” under the Employment Rights Act 1996). “You don’t get a lot of rights as a worker, but you do get some,” Farrar says. “Minimum wage, holiday pay, protection against discrimination, whistleblower protection. Not much else. But these rights are really important if you are self-employed as part of someone else’s business, especially at the lower end of the market.” The idea that such rights are incompatible with the flexibility offered by Uber is, he believes, false. All full-time British workers are entitled to 28 days of holiday a year. For part-time workers, holiday accrues at a rate of 12.07%. So for every hour you work, you are entitled to 7.725 minutes of holiday. Rather than rendering this impossible to calculate, Uber’s technology ought to make it much easier. As for pay, while £10-£15 an hour is often cited as a typical driver earning rate, in reality, once a driver has paid 25% commission to Uber, plus about £250 a month to lease a car, £100 a month for petrol, £50 for car washes and so on, earnings often fail to clear the minimum wage threshold. Drivers tell me they only really make proper money on Friday and Saturday nights; they say the idea that you can log off and on between school runs and auditions is a myth. One anonymous blogger, Uber Driver London, calculated his earnings at £23,000 a year (£18,000 after tax) for 60 hours’ work a week with no holidays. At £7.19 an hour, this would be under the minimum wage of £7.83 an hour for workers over 25. Of course, drivers can always take advantage of the limitless overtime afforded by Uber’s “flexibility”. Farrar notes that when Uber dropped rates for drivers waiting at Heathrow from £1.20 a mile to 70p a mile to optimise supply and demand, there was still a huge queue of cars at the airport. “That’s a serious market signal to me,” he says. “You can drop and drop and drop and drop, and people will still work. One, because they’re desperate. They’ll have a fixed number in their head, say, £500, and they will work for 40 hours or 80 hours to get that, whatever it takes. Two, because of the economics of the job; people will take it because they have to pay off those debts. They’ll accept any work.” The reason Uber hasn’t lavished us with heartwarming PR campaigns in the past is because it has adopted a very successful twofold strategy. The first is to make the user experience seamless – as close as possible to Kalanick’s dream of using your smartphone as a “remote control for life” – in the hope that sheer convenience will override any ethical concerns. “What we have to do is just keep reminding them of the awesome experience they have with the app,” says the marketing officer on the podcast. “The amazing experience they have in the car. And then they’ll just keep riding more and more with us.” Considerable effort goes into ensuring that there are plenty of little cars on your smartphone screen when you log on, the fare is cheap, the wait is short, your driver doesn’t talk to you about politics or religion and that he or she will return lost property to you (in their own time) if you leave it in their car (under threat of being reported to the police). When I surveyed friends who use Uber, everyone was aware of the company’s toxicity but were generally reassured by the responses the drivers gave when they asked them how they liked working for Uber. For James Bloodworth, who worked for Uber while researching his book Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain, those conversations need to be set in context. “People asked me if I liked driving for Uber when I was driving and I always felt reluctant to criticise Uber. If you start a negative conversation, you’re more likely to receive a negative rating – and if your reputation falls below 4.4 stars then you’re deactivated.” The conversations that drivers have among themselves are very different in tone, he says. One recent post on the independently run Uber People forum is entitled I Hate Uber: “Guys, do you think is OK 13 hours for £106 after commission working … is it just me or Uber like a cancer destroying drivers mentally and financially?” The consensus is it used to be a lot better for drivers than it is – although one driver shoots back: “No one forced you to be Uber partner driver. You became so on your own free choice. Don’t blame Uber or anyone else.” Bloodworth says that most Uber drivers come from still shadier areas of the economy – and an inscrutable algorithm is often a step up from an exploitative boss. “Overwhelmingly, they’re migrant workers. They have usually come from the back rooms of restaurants or other private hire firms, which are some of the worst industries in London. Restaurant kitchen work is often completely off-grid, no minimum wage. And in regular private-hire firms, you’re at the mercy of the controller. That’s why you have laws around the minimum wage. If you go to Barking [east London], say, you can find someone who will work for £2 an hour. It’s not enough to say: ‘There’s a choice.’ That choice is made in a context.” Which brings us on to the other reason Uber hasn’t offered us much in the way of shiny advertising campaigns. It has instead put its resources into influencing those in power not to mess with a business model that rests on eroding workers’ rights. The company’s head of communications and policy from 2015-2017 was Rachel Whetstone. She is a former Conservative adviser, married to David Cameron’s former aide Steve Hilton, is the godmother of one of Cameron’s children and is the granddaughter of Antony Fisher, the battery-chicken farming magnate who founded the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank. Cameron came under scrutiny for attending a party Whetstone threw at the restaurant Sexy Fish with the lobbying firm Portland in 2015. And last year, leaked emails written by Cameron’s former adviser Daniel Korski showed how No 10 had put pressure on the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, into abandoning proposed legislation to regulate Uber and its rivals. While Johnson’s successor, Khan, has been more critical of Uber, declining to renew its licence last year, he preferred to focus on safety concerns rather than employees’ rights. Last month, as part of the same attempt to change the conversation, Uber revealed an insurance scheme for drivers backed by Axa, promising a £1,000 payout for maternity leave and sick pay, capped at £1,125. For Farrar, that doesn’t begin to redress the balance. “It’s a bit like throwing a toothbrush to a drowning man: ‘I’ll take it, it might come in handy one day. But it’s a bit of a distraction from the crisis I’m in right now.’” Uber is still determined to challenge any attempts to get it to pay basic minimum wage to its drivers. So what’s a cash-strapped millennial to do? It is undeniable that Uber has made the business of getting around London and other cities much more convenient. It’s cheaper than a black cab and more convenient; usually, that’s an either/or choice. But there are already signs that Uber is having unwanted consequences, not only on traffic but on the wider transport ecosystem. TfL recently announced a surprise Tube fare shortfall of £1bn as passengers abandon the service, jeopardising future improvements. But Farrar doesn’t believe that consumers stopping using the app is the answer. “The underlying problem is that the government is not enforcing the law. It’s allowing firms to pay less than the minimum wage. It’s the government’s responsibility, not that of some twentysomething who wants to get home after a night out.” He would like Uber’s business customers to think twice, however. “If you go to Canary Wharf on a weekday night, you’ll see all the bankers going home in private hire vehicles paid for by their companies. They’re the ones I expect more from. We can’t fault low-paid young people for taking an Uber. They shouldn’t be shouldering the responsibility. But we can ask the government. We can ask the regulator. And we can ask businesses.” Bloodworth has similar sympathies with cash-strapped young people. But he asks them to consider the ethics. “There’s a very obvious connection between cheap fares and the low level of money that the drivers are getting. It’s like sweatshop clothes. Someone somewhere is paying for your cheap fare. The internet makes it much easier to ignore that. It’s not just the guy driving your taxi or delivering your pizza who suffers. These conditions spread and become the new normal. Soon, it will be your job, too.”"

          "bodyText": "I dread them, these utterly inappropriate juxtapositions of advertising and Guardian journalism online. An ad for bacon alongside an article about Ramadan, for instance. Justifiably angry readers assume that advertising department people have done it, carelessly or malevolently. They haven’t. It is the work of artificially (but insufficiently) intelligent tools placing advertising in a media market that is being transformed by technology. Since there appears to be no immediate solution to these randomly occurring incidents, one practical step is to raise awareness of the problem and pre-emptively “ask pardon”, as CP Scott, the Guardian’s great owner-editor, put it many years ago. I sympathise with the Guardian’s commercial executives operating in a business environment in which Google and Facebook are soaking up an enormous proportion of the ad revenues that the traditional media used to share. Like other news organisations with serious journalistic intent and proud histories, the Guardian must adapt. Algorithm-facilitated advertising – “programmatic”, in the jargon – is a fact of life for now. To the extent trouble is foreseeable in certain editorial contexts, the automatic flow can be turned off. But that turns off the revenue too. Some prudent manual steps can help to some extent, and I am advised that artificially intelligent solutions are being developed, though none is adequate yet. Meanwhile, the threat to trust and confidence remains, as these examples, painful to recount, illustrate. Coverage of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, during which more than 70 people died, included reports of a mother throwing her child from a window to rescuers below. One accompanying ad, for a retailer of clothing, depicted airborne children with angel wings. Another ad was for a crematorium. Programmatic ads come and go from screens, so these kinds of horrible juxtapositions with the editorial content don’t last. But once seen at all they can do damage. Readers who believe that, as with printed newspapers, each ad on digital platforms is placed in its editorial surroundings by humans, or previewed by them, can be enraged. “Is this some kind of sick joke?” asked one. The anger is not directed at the advertiser as much as the Guardian. Other readers show understanding but remain disapproving: “While I am sure that this would just be an algorithm glitch I think you should be aware as at best it seems in very poor taste and may be very upsetting to some readers.” People can be forgiving at the same time as seeking reassurance. “I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt,” wrote one reader about an automated juxtaposition that had unintended racist implications. The woman worked for a US organisation that promotes educational opportunities for black students. She liked a Guardian opinion piece about counselling services for black and minority ethnic students at a UK university and she planned to repost it to her organisation’s social media page – until she saw the accompanying ad for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. “While I have nothing against the fund or the Guardian,” she wrote, “the placement is inappropriate. Given the number of times people of colour are called ‘apes’, ‘animals’, or ‘gorillas’ I can only hope embedding this video into the middle of an article about black students was simply a bad coincidence and that I’m being overly sensitive.” The case reminded me of Google’s discomfort in 2015 when a black computer scientist tweeted that Google’s artificially intelligent photo tagging service had labelled him and a black friend as gorillas. The company apologised and promised action. It blocked the AI from using “gorilla” as an image tag. Last January the technology magazine Wired reported that the block remained, notwithstanding impressive performances by Google AI-assisted tools in various recent tests. Wired commented: “Google’s caution around images of gorillas illustrates a shortcoming of existing machine-learning technology. With enough data and computing power, software can be trained to categorise images or transcribe speech to a high level of accuracy. But it can’t easily go beyond the experience of that training. And even the very best algorithms lack the ability to use common sense, or abstract concepts, to refine their interpretation of the world as humans do.” Human refinements that will be useful for the time being in the digital advertising environment include giving the benefit of the doubt, asking pardon, trusting and appreciating what it is to be trusted.• Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"

          "bodyText": "Even the most revered authors held down day jobs, from TS Eliot’s time at Lloyd’s to Walt Whitman’s stint as a government clerk. Now a “successful hedge fund with a passion for literature” is offering wannabe novelists the chance to turn literature itself into the nine to five, by offering a salary to its writers. De Montfort Literature, a new publishing company that is part of London hedge fund De Montfort Capital, is offering a £24,000 starting salary to writers who pass its selection process, which includes an algorithm that is “designed to identify career novelists”, psychometric tests and interviews. With up to 10 places initially available, De Montfort will also offer mentors and editors to provide advice and support, as well as designing, promoting and publishing the work. Authors would receive 50% of profits. Founder and author Jonathan de Montfort said that “holding down a full-time job is not conducive to writing fiction. So, it occurred to me, if we pay a salary that allows writing to become a full-time occupation, then we should free up lots of talented authors.” He added: “The traditional publishing models for fiction writers are littered with obstacles. Securing a literary agent is a lottery, and self-publishing is costly and time-consuming. These routes also lend themselves to the affluent, who can afford mentoring, education, copy editors and proof readers. Our model is more accessible and de-risks the process.” De Montfort acknowledged that his proposed method of finding authors using tests and an algorithm may sound “a little sinister” to some, but said he believed it was fairer than traditional publishing methods. “The algorithm is oblivious to your background, culture, wealth, race or gender. There’s no bias – it only cares that you have what it takes to be a top-selling novelist.” The publisher’s website says that while traditional publishers “can pick and choose the best manuscripts they have without having to pay anything for them”, writers “have to do all the work, take all the risk and then hope their manuscript gets accepted. De Montfort Literature is backed by a hedge fund, so it has more money at its disposal to invest in authors”. “I really believe there are lots of great authors out there frustrated by the existing routes to market,” said De Montfort. “We are offering a genuine alternative. We are prepared to invest in authors over a long period of time – five to 10 years, if necessary – with our expectation of return at the end of that period, once they become established.” The Society of Authors’ director Nicola Solomon said the writers’ organisation was “always happy to see new publishing models that give choice to authors. A salary of £24,000 a year for writing novels would probably be attractive to any new writer and is more than the advances that many would receive in traditional publishing.” But she expressed concern about aspects of the company, including De Montfort’s intention to share copyright with an author, to claim copyright in “ideas”, not just the work, as well as the requirement for an author not to write for another publisher for two years after leaving De Montfort. She saidDe Montfort had been in touch with the society about working with the organisation to offer better terms and conditions. “I am hopeful that we can help them improve the model,” said Solomon. “De Montfort Literature is risking capital on this project and obviously we want to see a return,” the hedge-fund founder said. “My ambition is to build a stable of bestselling novelists. We will not achieve this by exploiting authors. It is a partnership and we want to make it work for everyone involved.”"

          "bodyText": "Depending on what you have done to your algorithm, you may have seen a video for gold chicken wings on Instagram this month. The video is short, boring and gross. A pile of golden chicken wings sit on a plate. In the corner is a pot of blue-cheese sauce. From nowhere appears a latexed hand. One wing is picked, you hear the word “lit”, the chicken is dipped and the camera pans around to show a pair of lips, turning gold as they chew. With the volume up, you can hear the sound of mastication. Golden hot wings are the Midasian ruse of Jonathan Cheban, a publicist turned food influencer who, after some wrangling, legally changed his name to Foodgōd. Designed in “collab” with the Ainsworth, a US restaurant that describes itself as multipurpose venue, they cost $45 for 10 or £1,000 for 50 with a bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne. Foodgōd is famous for appearing on TV with the Kardashians, and designing a phone cover that doubles up as a mirror, but has rebranded himself as a would-be “Anthony Bourdain for the young and hot”. His currency grew on Snapchat, a skill he parlayed into faddy eating. Foodgōd is also whimsical. He likes the ō because it looks like “a halo” but sometimes drops it. Cooking doesn’t interest him – “Chefs cook, I eat out” – but ambiance does. He is the living embodiment of the viral era. He may like gold chicken today, but tomorrow, who knows. Still, it’s all meaningless unless it tastes good. To make this golden chicken, the meat is brined for 12 hours, coated with a dry rub, baked, flash-fried, smothered in a gold marinade with extra honey barbecue sauce, and finished with a layer of gold dust. For less than £20, I made two versions of my own: one using some edible gold leaf bought from Thailand and a KFC drumstick, and another using imitation gold on a pack of Co-op chicken wings. The gold on the latter attached well to the meat, but it wasn’t actually edible. The Thai gold was, but dissolved into the KFC fat. Gold needs to be in its purest 24k form to be safe to eat. The problem is, it tastes of nothing. Your body can’t digest it and it has no nutritional value. You might as well be lighting a fag with a burning tenner – the joy, it seems, is in destroying it. Gold food isn’t new – in 2016 in Manila, a dozen Golden Cristal Ube doughnuts sold for $1,200; in Abu Dhabi, a 24-karat gold flaked cappuccino costs £15 – nor is conspicuous consumerism. But the video’s popularity – “almost 1.5 million viewers and counting!” – is significant. Clean eating, with its focus on greens and juice is dominating the weird world of Instagram food porn. By contrast, Foodgōd and his gold chicken wings seem almost nostalgic."

          "headline": "Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier – review",
          "bodyText": "Many of the ideas in Jaron Lanier’s new book start off pretty familiar – at least, if you are active on social media. Yet in every chapter there is a principle so elegant, so neat, sometimes even so beautiful, that what is billed as straight polemic becomes something much more profound. The concept of random reinforcement, for example: addiction fed not by reward but by never knowing whether or when the reward will come, is well known. But Lanier puts it like this: “The algorithm is trying to capture the perfect parameters for manipulating a brain, while the brain, in order to seek out deeper meaning, is changing in response to the algorithm’s experiments … Because the stimuli from the algorithm doesn’t mean anything, because they genuinely are random, the brain isn’t responding to anything real, but to a fiction. That process – of becoming hooked on an elusive mirage – is addiction.” The restless scrolling, the clammy self-reproach afterwards … we could recognise that as addiction quite easily, but the mathematical mechanism for having created it makes horrible sense (Lanier isn’t that interested in culprits, though he finds all of Silicon Valley pretty callow). He wears his tech credentials lightly, as he can afford to, having been there for the creation of the internet; he was chief scientist of the engineering office of Internet2 and there in the very first chat-rooms, whence he draws the conclusion that I found the least convincing: even at its incipience, online communication tended towards the hostile. “Sometimes, out of nowhere, I would get into a fight with someone … It was so weird. We’d start insulting each other, trying to score points.” Since this all predated algorithmic manipulation, and cannot be blamed on Facebook, he concludes that we have pack behaviours and solitary behaviours: in a pack, we become locked in internecine competition; on our own “we’re more free. We’re cautious, but also more capable of joy.” This flattens out some vital distinctions: there’s a difference between getting together to talk to strangers about why your celibacy is a woman’s fault, and mustering online to start the Arab spring. Silicon Valley has a distinctive way of looking at things: have big idea; iterate; fix; iterate again. It works well in software design, but it’s possible that to apply to very complex systems (like human beings), the big idea has to be refined a little more before it’s tested. Lanier explicitly addresses this in chapter eight, Social Media Doesn’t Want You to Have Economic Dignity, as he describes how our modern reality was seeded by that mindset, those peculiar yes/no certainties of the web’s earliest creators. The internet was built with no way to make or get payments, no way to find other people you might like. “Everyone knew these functions … would be needed. We figured it would be wiser to let entrepreneurs fill in the blanks than to leave that task to government … We foolishly laid the foundations for global monopolies.” Given the network effect – that Uber only works if everyone is on it – a thousand flowers were never going to bloom. There’s only room for one and it’s a Venus fly trap. The same libertarian spirit also instituted the peculiar economics of the internet: software had to be free, because only that way would it be open (“everyone knew that software would eventually become more important than law, so the prospect of a world running on hidden code was dark and creepy”). Yet that meant programmers wouldn’t be paid: they would create free code and make money by solving problems later. And so the gig economy was born, this highly skilled field spreading its insecurity to low-skilled ones, food delivery, retail. Neo-Marxians would have something to say about capital in all this but Lanier emphatically doesn’t claim to have all the answers. “Please take what you can use from me. I know I don’t know everything,” he says in a winsome footnote. His most dispiriting observations are those about what social media does to politics – biased, “not towards the left or right, but downwards”. If triggering emotions is the highest prize, and negative emotions are easier to trigger, how could social media not make you sad? If your consumption of content is tailored by near limitless observations harvested about people like you, how could your universe not collapse into the partial depiction of reality that people like you also enjoy? How could empathy and respect for difference thrive in this environment? Where’s the incentive to stamp out fake accounts, fake news, paid troll armies, dyspeptic bots? I finished this stark but exuberant account not fearing for the future so much as amazed the world wasn’t already even worse. • Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now is published by Bodley Head.

          "headline": "Slavisa Jokanovic in prime position to enhance Fulham’s playing options",
          "bodyText": "Slavisa Jokanovic opted for some sporting cross‑pollination when asked whether, after two and a half years of battles won and lost, Fulham’s promotion from the Championship felt especially sweet. “Like in tennis, we lost one match point,” he said. “But today we smashed the second match point. We are a Premier League team.” They are, and Jokanovic could feel welcome to all the emphatic language he liked. A double-fault would have been crushing for Fulham, whose charge towards automatic promotion blew up against Birmingham on a hard, well‑grown pitch that perplexed their players and seemed to have laid bare a soft underbelly. Instead their manager can reflect on deserved victory over forces that had at one stage cast his tenure into doubt and could sense that, having so successfully got his own way once, he has enough credit built up to get it again. “I prefer not so much to think about bad things, about problems,” Jokanovic, palpably in celebration mode as a beery, bubbly, bouncing Fulham dressing room cavorted a few metres away, said after it was suggested that victory at Wembley against Aston Villa may have brought a sense of vindication. Relations within Fulham were strained while Jokanovic was under the leash of Craig Kline’s algorithm‑based transfer policy, a situation that ended with Kline’s departure in October. The Serb was duly allowed to sign Matt Targett and Aleksandar Mitrovic on loan during the January transfer window and it is doubtful, particularly given the latter’s 12-goal return, whether he would be disposed to quite such sanguine thinking now if those deals had not been completed. Further internal power struggles would be a damaging distraction before a top-flight season in which, given calm waters, there is little reason to expect Fulham should struggle. Their owner, Shahid Khan, strode jauntily – it would be too easy to say “proprietorially” – out of the stadium he fancies buying but the serious business will soon start again and Jokanovic should start talks over transfer strategy from a commanding position. “It depends what kind of ambition we are going to show, this is simple,” he said of Fulham’s prospects for 2018-19. “Next year we’re going to be in the Premier League, not competing in the Championship. We need to be brave, we need to make investment, we need to spend money to survive or to make a more important step. It’s not so complicated to understand.” Khan will, presumably, hear that at closer quarters soon and Jokanovic’s cause may be strengthened given that his own capabilities have not gone unnoticed elsewhere. An earlier link with Chelsea may have been dismissed but the idea was not completely outrageous and it would be folly to risk things coming apart at the seams now. “It’s probably the best football of my career,” Mitrovic said before leaving Wembley. “Of course I will be happy to stay at Fulham but we will see what happens and we will speak to my agent and other clubs.” Jokanovic will expect to agree a permanent deal with Newcastle for his countryman for starters and will also hope Ryan Sessegnon – “I prefer to stay with him and what I know is that the kid wants to stay too,” he said – is induced to stay another year before his inevitable progression to a Champions League club. For Villa these must seem first‑world problems now. Steve Bruce, ashen-faced afterwards and clearly ready for a break after a traumatic six months, will almost certainly have to rebuild in their third and final year of parachute payments. Jack Grealish, the best player on the pitch against Fulham despite seeing the artist‑artisan balance tilted firmly against his side, asked Villa’s press officer to shield him from the media as he walked through the mixed zone and it would be a leap of faith to predict him talking as their player again. John Terry is out of contract and the outstanding loan goalkeeper Sam Johnstone will surely find a top‑tier club to sign him permanently from Manchester United while Alan Hutton, Mile Jedinak and James Chester are all creaking. From Championship big guns upon their relegation in 2016 they face a battle to avoid flailing among the many also-rans who have fading memories of glories past. “You have to get together and go again next season,” their left-back Ahmed Elmohamady said. Exactly how many of them do remains to be seen; the same question may be asked of Fulham but, when his next test of wills comes around, Jokanovic should have a crashing overhead volley up his sleeve."

          "bodyText": "No matter how suspicious it has seemed that Amazon is encouraging us to put listening devices in every room of our homes, the company has always said that its Echo assistants are not listening in on or recording conversations. Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”. It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission. Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.” She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything. “I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’” An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”. At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like ‘Alexa’. Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud ‘To whom?’ At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, ‘[contact name], right?’ Alexa then interpreted background conversation as ‘right’.” Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.” Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."

          "headline": "Mail Online's falling traffic blamed on Facebook's newsfeed overhaul",
          "bodyText": "Mail Online has lost almost a tenth of its global audience and advertising revenue growth has slumped following Facebook’s move to deprioritise news appearing on users’ timelines. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), the parent company of Mail Online, the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, saw its share price tumble by 7% as investors reacted to the forecast of a revenue slowdown in the second half of its financial year because of tough advertising and property markets. The company said Mail Online lost almost 1.5 million daily global unique browsers in the six months to the end of March, to 13.6 million, a fall of 9%. The fall in traffic led to Mail Online’s revenue growth dropping to 2% year on year to £61m. Revenue growth was running at 28% year on year, according to DMGT’s results for its last financial year to the end of September. Mail Online says that a fairer measure is underlying revenue performance, which has fallen from 20% to 5% growth, which strips out factors including foreign exchange fluctuations. Mail Online is one of many websites to feel the impact of a major overhaul of Facebook’s news feed algorithm in January. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook, the world’s largest social media site, needed to refocus on “meaningful social interactions” and prioritise content shared by friends and family, reducing the amount of content appearing from publishers and brands that were “crowding out the personal moments”. In September, DMGT lauded a successful broadening of the reach of Mail Online, most notably through Facebook and Snapchat, saying the site hit operating profitability in the final quarter of its last financial year. On Thursday, the company said its focus was on growing direct visitors to Mail Online but that “indirect traffic, notably via search and social platforms”, had reduced significantly. “There has been a reduction in indirect traffic via the likes of Facebook and Google,” Tim Collier, the chief financial officer at DMGT, said at a presentation to analysts. “This is an industry-wide issue but we continue to outperform the market. Mail Online has an excellent track record and a clear strategy to prioritise direct traffic to both the homepage and the app, and this continues to grow and is a key reason for our outperformance.”"

          "headline": "Five things we learned from Mark Zuckerberg's European parliament appearance",
          "bodyText": "1. The European Parliament’s chosen format was a terrible way to elicit answers from one of the most powerful people in the world. Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance in front of the European parliament’s conference of presidents was a long-awaited opportunity to press the founder of the world’s biggest social network – which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp – on his company’s global influence and use of personal data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Instead, the rambling format saw the leaders of pan-European political groupings take it in turns to pose dozens of separate questions on wildly different topics, some of which were incisive and some of which involved oblique references to the literature of Goethe. After an hour, with only a few minutes of the hearing scheduled to remain, Zuckerberg was finally asked if he would like to respond to all the questions in one go. Understandably, he gave a speech containing broad answers and promised that his team would be in touch after the event with more precise responses. 2. Zuckerberg would like to make it clear that he is very, very sorry about how his platform has been used. Following the 2016 US presidential election, the Facebook founder said it was “crazy” to suggest that fake news on his platform had contributed to the election of Donald Trump. That Zuckerberg is long gone. He insisted that, while his social network was an overall force for good, mistakes had been made. “Whether it’s fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people’s information, we didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibilities. That was a mistake, and I’m sorry.” However, he suggested these problems could be fixed through new technology and an investment in extra staff. 3. Facebook’s social media dominance is under threat from MEPs who made it clear they considered it to be an uncompetitive monopoly. The European Union has form when it comes to breaking up monopolies, and MEPs made it clear that they now believe Facebook falls into that category. “I think it is time to discuss breaking Facebook’s monopoly, because it’s already too much power in one hand,” said Germany’s Manfred Weber MEP. “I ask you simply, and that is my final question: can you convince me not to do so?” Exactly how you could break up a social networking company is less clear. Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt asked whether Zuckerberg would be willing to sell Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp if it meant his company was able to retain control of the main social network and Instagram. 4. Nigel Farage is concerned about the impact Facebook’s recent algorithm changes could have on his ability to reach the public. Mark Zuckerberg looked less than delighted when the Ukip leader praised the role that social networks such as Facebook played in the triumph of Donald Trump and the vote for Brexit. It is easy to poke fun at Farage for asking Zuckerberg why Facebook’s recent algorithm change meant fewer people were reading his posts on the social network. But it is clear that hard-right and nationalistic political groups are increasingly vocal in their concerns that Facebook’s attempts to crack down on fake news and remove hate speech show a liberal bias. “Would you accept that today Facebook is not a platform for all ideas that is operated impartially?” asked Farage. 5. Zuckerberg lived to fight another day without making any substantial new pledges to change the way Facebook operates. Watching members of the UK select committee investigating fake news were not impressed that Zuckerberg had chosen to attend this event after having ignored their repeated requests to attend a hearing in Westminster. Zuckerberg and Facebook executives, on the other hand, were almost certainly delighted that the session had passed off without any major disasters. • This article was amended on 23 May 2018 because Guy Verhofstadt is Belgian, not Dutch as an earlier version said."

          "headline": "Mark Zuckerberg appears before European parliament – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "If you’re looking for a handy guide to what, exactly, happened today (and even if you watched the whole thing, you may want that question answered), my colleague Jennifer Rankin has the wrap. Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS committee, repeats his frustration at the hearing: What a missed opportunity for proper scrutiny on many crucial questions raised by the MEPs. Questions were blatantly dodged on shadow profiles, sharing data between WhatsApp and Facebook, the ability to opt out of political advertising and the true scale of data abuse on the platform. Unfortunately, the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point. I echo the clear frustration of colleagues in the room who felt the discussion was shut down. It is time that Mr Zuckerberg agreed to appear in front of the DCMS committee to provide Facebook users the answers they deserve. The European Parliament format is a terrible way to elicit answers from one of the most powerful people in the world. Zuckerberg would like to make it clear that he is very, very sorry about how his platform has been used for nefarious purposes. Facebook’s social media dominance is under threat from MEPs who made it clear that they consider it to be an uncompetitive monopoly. Nigel Farage is very concerned about the impact Facebook’s recent algorithm changes could have on his ability to reach the public. Zuckerberg lived to fight another day without making any substantial pledge to change the way Facebook operated. Reaction is coming in from observers, and, well, few of them think we witnessed a shining example of European democracy. Damian Collins, head of the DCMS committee: Lukusz Olejnik, privacy expert: European parliamentarians were left unsatisfied following a lengthy Q&amp;A session with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, as the chief executive took advantage of the odd format of the session – which saw each question asked back to back, before Zuckerberg answered them in one block – to avoid giving any specifics. More than two-thirds of the 90-minute meeting was spent on the questions, as the heads of each European party were offered their spot in the limelight, as well as a number of others from around the parliament. When the questioning finally ended, with just seven minutes to go until the scheduled end of the event, Zuckerberg responded in broad strokes, promising to cover the specific details of each question with follow-ups later on. Even angry interventions from some MEPs as the Facebook founder was preparing to leave couldn’t spark a substantial response, with the president of the EP, Antonio Tajani, eventually intervening to declare that time had run out, and that Zuckerberg would only be required to provide written answers at his leisure. And that’s it: Zuckerberg stands and leaves the room, as the MEPs huddle and commiserate with each other about the lack of a real debate. Procedural squabbles! A surprise final question, from Albrecht, asking again whether Facebook will commit to separating data from WhatsApp and Facebook; and another from Lamberts, the Green, asking again whether Zuckerberg will promise the ability to opt out from targeted advertising. But Zuckerberg refuses to answer the questions, promising to get to them in writing, and is backed up by Tajani, who ultimately cuts off the MEPs trying to get their specific questions answered. Zuckerberg is wrapping up with his standard promise to “follow up with each of you after … We’re going to have someone come to do a full hearing after.” On whether there will be more Cambridge Analyticas: “The good news with Cambridge Analytica is that the changes we made back in 2014 would prevent – it wouldn’t be possible for an app developer to get access to that level of data. “But because there were a lot of apps using the data in 2014, we think it’s good to go back and investigate the apps that got access to a lot of data before we locked down the platform. I do anticipate that there are going to be other apps that we’ll find that we want to take down. “This is part of our shift towards not just trying to manage the system reactively. Now what we’re doing is taking a much more proactive approach. We are going through and investigating ourselves up front.” On shadow profiles: “We just announced this ‘clear history’ feature. To your point earlier about separating out the security data, even if they’re not signed in, we need to know how they’re using the service to prevent bad activity. “On the security side, we think it’s important to protect people in our community.” On political bias: “I think that this is a very important topic. We are committed to being a platform for all ideas. That means we want to make it so that people can come to our service for everyone, across the political spectrum. “I can commit to you here today that we have not and will not make decisions about what content is allowed or how we do ranking on the basis of political orientation. On Nigel Farage’s specific point about distribution: “We’ve made a number of changes this year to ensure we’re showing people’s friends’ and family’s content more than content in general … It is not targeting any specific political ideology.” On GDPR: “A number of you asked when we expect to be fully compliant … We do expect to be compliant by May 25. One of the things that we learned is that people have to go through these extensive flows before they can be compliant on May 25. The last thing we want is people to go through the flows quickly. So we’ve been rolling out the flows for a while now, a large percentage of people have been going through them already. “We’ve gotten good feedback on that, and how we’ve implemented that so far.” On taxes: “Facebook has always paid taxes in all the countries where we have operations set up, and we invest heavily in Europe. We have two data centres, and we’re building another one in Denmark. “We’re making significant investments, to contribute to innovation and job growth here as well.” On monopolies and competition: “We exist in a very competitive space where people use a lot of different tools for communication. The average person uses eight different tools … so from where I sit, it feels like there are new types of media all the time.” (Zuckerberg doesn’t mention that four of those tools are owned by Facebook, and a number of the other eight are legacy technologies such as email, SMS and phone calls.) “One thing I want to add is that around the world there are 70m small businesses that use Facebook’s tools to grow and reach customers. “I think it’s important not to lose track that, when you’re talking about competition, there’s the extremely pro-competitive effect of allowing all these small businesses to reach customers in ways that previously only large businesses had the tools to do.” “There were a number of questions about regulation … The question is, what is the right regulation,” Zuckerberg says. “The important thing is to get this right, to make sure that we have regulatory frameworks that protect people, are flexible, don’t inadvertently prevent new technologies such as AI from being able to develop, and don’t prevent a student in their dorm room, like I was, from being able to develop the next great product.” Next up, Zuckerberg addresses elections. “This is one of our top priorities: making sure we prevent anyone from trying to interfere in elections, like Russians were trying to in 2016.” At this point, the format has largely allowed Zuckerberg to simply repeat his opening statement, and so we’re now hearing for the second time about the company’s new tools for transparency on political adverts. On fake news in particular, Zuckerberg notes a few reasons why it gets made. “The first is spam. The way you fight this is the same roadmap that companies have used to fight email spam: you take away the way to make profit. “The second category is fighting fake accounts. We took down about 580m in the last quarter. “The last category is people who are well-meaning but just happen to share something that is provably false. We don’t want to be in the position of saying who is true or false – we work with third-party fact-checkers, and we’re public about who they are, and if they say the story is provably false, we peg something to that and try to show it less.” On moderation, hate speech and censorship, Zuckerberg calls back to, yes, the days he started the company in his dorm room in college. “Our policy has been to have someone flag things for us to look at reactively. Now, here in 2018, we have the ability to get more AI tools to be able to flag more content up front. “So if you look, for example, at terror content, one of the things I’m proud of is that our systems can now flag 99% of the Al-Qaeda and ISIS content before anyone else flags them to us.” The company has also worked, he says, to improve its response to suicide and self-harm on Facebook Live, getting the response time down to 10 minutes. “We’ll never be perfect on this. Our adversaries, especially on the election side, will have access to the same tools we do. But our vision is moving from one of reactive management to us more proactively flagging things.” Now the questioning is over, Zuckerberg begins answering, with seven minutes left until the end of the session. This format is extremely odd. The last question, from Jan Philipp Albrecht, the GDPR rapporteur. “I welcome that Facebook is complying with GDPR,” he says. “In the US Senate you responded, ‘We collect some data for security purposes’ [from logged-out users]. Can you promise this isn’t used for other purposes? “Will you promise to me, and also to EU WhatsApp and Facebook users, that there won’t be any exchange of data from Friday onwards?” Claude Moraes, British Labour, is here as the chair of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee. He notes the big difference between congress and the EU: “We are here [gestures up] in terms of regulation, and the United States is here [gestures down]. I know you will say, ‘Of course we’re going to comply with GDPR.’ “The question I’ve been asked … is whether the question of the protection of privacy in Facebook apps is actually the tip of the iceberg, or is there a bigger iceberg?” Isn’t blocking 200 apps for potential infringements, he says, “a clear signal that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users?” Finally, he asks if Facebook will give all its users access to their full marketing profiles. Another MEP appears, asking questions about Cambridge Analytica. “Does Facebook check compliance by companies?” she asks. “Which specific things will Facebook do to prevent another scandal?” The DUP’s Diane Dodds, as a member of a party that’s not in any political grouping, also gets to ask a question. She attacks Zuckerberg for failing to crack down on fake accounts created for bullying. “Can you explain to us, in light of this phenomenon, what you’re doing to work with third-party organisations to try and educate people in safety in using the internet? And would you tell us that you’re content that other families will have their children kept safe? “We live in a Europe, in the rise of anti-semitism, in the rise of terrorism, much of it conducted online. Can you tell us how you define acceptable comment on the site?” Nicolas Bay, of France’s National Front, next, on the same tack as Farage. Facebook, he says, creates a dependency in its users. “Facebook’s decisions are very important: it’s the same as banning a newspaper if you don’t agree with its opinions.” Generation Identity, a French far-right group, was banned from Facebook, he says. “If you prevent people from visiting the pages of legal groups, you’re preventing them from receiving the opinions that are legal in society. “The hunt for fake news has become fashionable right now, but hasn’t that become an excuse for shutting down freedom of expression?” Nigel Farage next, who describes himself as the EU’s largest Facebook user, before – as he teased – launching into an attack on Facebook as a biased, partial platform. “What is absolutely true is that since January this year, you’ve changed your algorithms, and it’s led to a substantial drop to views and engagements for those who’ve got right-of-centre political opinions. On average, we’re down about 25% over the course of this year. “I’m not talking about extremism,” Farage says. “What interests me is, who decides what is acceptable? Who are these third-party fact-checkers? Why is there no transparency in this process? “I’m beginning to wonder whether we need a social media bill of rights to basically protect free speech. Would you accept that Facebook is not a platform for all ideas, one that is not impartial?” Gabriele Zimmer, a German socialist, is the first to ask a question in a language other than English. She criticises Zuckerberg for the closed nature of the meeting, before turning to the way the site has, she says, degraded since it was formed. “These platforms have changed. There’s a lot more fake news, the communities have gotten smaller, you have a very narrow view of the world. “If we look at the situation in Germany, that can be compensated in public debate – but for people in other parts of the world, this can be deadly. We have seen these cases on Facebook that have lead to the deaths of people. Can the Facebook business model be changed and brought back to its initial mission as a communication platform?” She then cites Goethe as an example, somehow, before noting that Facebook’s verbal support of GDPR isn’t in concert with the company moving 1.5bn people out of the regulation’s remit. She adds that “Facebook was founded as a ‘hot or not’ platform,” before asking whether that means the company can really support women’s rights. (Tajani adds that Zuckerberg came when invited, and the meeting was public as agreed.) Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, asks a string of yes/no questions: Will Facebook promise “systematic” and “public” transparency on all electoral campaigns? Will it allow all users to opt-out of targeted advertising? Does it produce content, or is it a neutral platform? Will it publish a list of people it employs and their salaries? Will Facebook publish its tax affairs in every country? Next, Guy Verhofstadt, who says he knows Zuckerberg through Dave Eggers’ “The Circle”, a book about a malicious, all-powerful tech company. The difference, he notes, is that Zuckerberg isn’t all-powerful. “I think this is your 14th, 15th apology … This year you’ve apologised three times already. Are you capable to fix it? There has to be clearly a problem. The only way I can see to fix it is to have public regulation. It’s a bit like the banks in ’07, ’08: they said, ‘Oh, we’ll regulate ourselves,’ but they didn’t.” On to questions: Verhofstadt picks up on the recent transfer of non-European users outside of the reach of GDPR, and asks if we can trust that Facebook will actually obey GDPR. “Will you compensate European Facebook users, as required by GDPR?” As for Facebook’s monopoly, he describes Zuckerberg pointing to Apple and Google as competitors as like a car company saying, “We don’t have a monopoly, you can take a train or a plane!” He asks whether Facebook would be willing to split off Messenger and WhatsApp, or keep Instagram. “I really think we have a big problem here. You have to ask yourself how will you be remembered – as one of the three big internet giants, with Jobs and Gates, or as an internet monster?” Britain’s Syed Kamall up next. He reassures Zuckerberg that they aren’t here to try and crush a successful business, but notes concerns, particularly around the company’s gathering of data on non-Facebook users. “I know that by having my own Facebook account, I take some responsibility … but if I don’t have a Facebook account, is the only way to stop Facebook collecting my data by staying off the internet altogether? Is it morally acceptable to collect non-Facebook users’ data without them knowing what you do with it?” Next, German social democrat Udo Bullmann. “Are you ready to completely comply with the new regulation in Europe within the next three days?” Bullmann asks. “Can you guarantee Facebook is in line with the new rules, and that Facebook won’t sell data to third parties without proper consent? “How can you guarantee that no manipulation of the forthcoming vote will happen? In which way will you adapt your business model to ensure that can happen?” Bullmann’s questions, he says, are about “the right of self-government of nations.” On to the questions: oddly, every MEP will ask their questions first, then Zuckerberg will answer them all at the end. “Is Cambridge Analytica an isolated case? Can you guarantee that another scandal will not happen in three, six, nine months’ time?” asks German MEP Manfred Weber. Then: “Did you personally make the decision in 2015 to not notify your users?” “Between Europe and America, we have a different understanding of what is allowed and not allowed to publish,” Weber adds. “I see a lot of member states at the moment asking Facebook to voluntarily ban messages [such as glorification of nazisim]”, he says, adding that “asking” should be “telling”. And finally, directly: can Zuckerberg name a competitor? Would he describe Facebook as a monopoly? “Can you convince me not to break up Facebook?” “Facebook plays a positive role in elections around the world by helping leaders like you connect directly with voters,” Zuckerberg says. “I am determined to keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful ways.” “We’re very committed to Europe,” he adds. Dublin is the international headquarters, London the largest non-US engineering corps, Paris a chunk of the AI workforce. By the end of this year, the company will employ more than 10,000 Europeans, he says. “Now let’s turn to elections,” Zuckerberg says. “In 2016, we were too slow to identify Russian interference on Facebook in the US presidential election. At the time we were more focused on traditional cyberattacks. “Since then, we’ve made significant investments to make this sort of attack harder to do on Facebook. We’ve done a better job since 2016, including in the French elections, the German elections, and the Alabama special election.” Zuckerberg cites the company’s tracking and removal of fake accounts, as well as its removal of the ways in which fake news spammers can make money, as examples of changes that have improved Facebook’s ecosystem. He also brings up Facebook’s recent creation of advertising transparency tools, promising that they will launch globally this summer. GDPR next. “We’ve always shared these values … and now we’re going even further to comply with these strong new rules. We’re making the same controls and settings available to people from around the world.” Zuckerberg teases the company’s forthcoming “clear history” setting, which will let users remove Facebook’s profiling and browser tracking. On to Cambridge Analytica, where Zuckerberg runs through the list of changes the company has already made or promised to make as a result of the scandal: limiting the amount of data apps can gather, advising users to check their app privacy settings, and investigating all apps that received significant amounts of personal data under the previous regime. “We’ve investigated thousands of apps, and suspended more than 200.” Zuckerberg is up with his opening statement. He highlights the company’s safety check tool, helping in the midst of terror attacks; refugees using Facebook to keep in touch with people at home; small businesses using Facebook’s tools to operate online. “But it’s also clear that we haven’t done enough to prevent those tools being misused, that was a mistake, and I’m sorry for it.” He commits to doubling the number of people working on the company’s security, and notes it will “significantly impact our profitability – but keeping people safe will always be more important than our profits.” For anyone hoping for more in-depth questions than we got from the US Congress, we’ve just heard that each MEP gets just three minutes to quiz Zuckerberg – 60 seconds less than the American senators got. Now we’re off for real. “This is an important mark of respect towards the European parliament and European citizens,” Tajani says in English to Zuckerberg – highlighting why the British parliament feels so snubbed by the Facebook founder’s continued refusal to cross the Channel and appear in London. Tajani notes that, in one year’s time, the European Union will vote in new MEPs, and warns that “democracy should never become a marketing operation, where anyone who buys our data can buy political advantage”. “We want the major digital companies to respect the rules for the harvesting and use of our data. In a few days, GDPR will enter in to force … Today’s meeting is just a starting point as we move towards a new form of governance for digital platforms.” Mark Zuckerberg is appearing in front of the European Parliament this evening – leaving British MPs looking on enviously. The House of Commons select committee investigating fake news has repeatedly asked the Facebook founder to attend one of its hearings, only to be rebuffed each time. In March Facebook sent a mid-ranking executive to answer questions from the digital, culture, media, and sport select committee. The committee said this was not enough and asked for Zuckerberg. In April a senior executive was flown in from California to answer hours of questioning. The committee said this was not enough and asked for Zuckerberg. Eventually, MPs ran out of patience and earlier this month threatened Zuckerberg with a formal summons. The problem is that Facebook called the committee’s bluff, pointed out that the law surrounding formal summons was fundamentally unenforceable, and said Zuckerberg had absolutely no intention of attending such a hearing. Instead, the select committee was reduced to asking Zuckerberg to appear via video link while on his trip to the European parliament, while publishing a list of questions they’d really like MEPs ask. “If Mark Zuckerberg chooses not to address our questions directly, we are asking colleagues at the European Parliament to help us get answers – particularly on who knew what at the company, and when, about the data breach and the non-transparent use of political adverts which continue to undermine our democracy,” said committee chair Damian Collins MP. What can we expect when the closed doors open? Around an hour of European politicians shouting at Mark Zuckerberg for various reasons. Aside from Farage, who has already previewed his angle of attack, expect three major themes to recur: Cambridge Analytica, GDPR, and Facebook’s monopoly. The first is the reason why Zuckerberg is speaking to the parliament today. The chief executive’s apology tour began the week after the news broke, in the pages of the Observer, that the social network had handed the personal data of millions of users over to a researcher who incorporated some of it into a model intended for use by the shadowy electoral consultancy. The second is the more pressing issue for Europe. The privacy mega-regulation, which sees the EU flex its extraterritorial might in an attempt to reshape the internet, has been welcomed by Facebook verbally, even as the company’s actions have left some wondering how seriously the company takes it. And the third is what’s looming over the whole relationship. Facebook hasn’t yet come under public scrutiny from the EU’s competition commission, which has been focused on Google as the key Silicon Valley monopoly. But that could change at the stroke of a pen from Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, who could make life very difficult indeed for Zuckerberg. Here’s the picture of Zuckerberg’s arrival that the EP thought was so important, it set up a whole second livestream to broadcast. Perfectly normal behaviour. It’s started – sort of. Zuckerberg arrived and posed for a handshake picture with EP president Antonio Tajani. Then the pair moved into an adjoining seminar room, where the livestream promptly ended with a door being closed in front of the camera. When this private one-on-one ends, at around 17.15 UK time, the real event will begin. Zuckerberg will be speaking to the European parliament’s “conference of presidents”, the committee made up of the leaders of the eight major political groupings of the parliament. Most recognisable to many readers will be the leader of the nationalist Europe of Freedom and Democracy party, one Nigel Farage MEP. Farage has already promised to use the hearing to attack Zuckerberg over perceived anti-rightwing wing bias on the site, repeating a talking point heard at length in the US congressional hearings: Conservative MEP Syed Kamall will also be present, as the chairman of the rightwing Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group. Rounding out the British representation in the room will be Labour MEP Claude Moraes, who’ll be there in his role as chair of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee. Another familiar face amongst the politicians will be Guy Verhofstadt, the European Union’s representative on all matters Brexit. In this hearing, he’ll be attending in his role as the leader of the of the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s liveblog of Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance in front of the European parliament. It’s been a fight to get here, with the president of the parliament finally announcing on Monday morning that he had secured an agreement that the previously closed-door session should be live-streamed to the public. If you’d rather watch than follow along here, you’ll find the stream on the parliament’s website."

          "bodyText": "The news that Theresa May has urged the NHS and technology companies to adopt artificial intelligence techniques in order to diagnose diseases such as cancer is extremely positive for both the healthcare community and for patients (May to promise millions for AI tools to help fight cancer, 21 May). But to usher in an age of AI, there are several obstacles that must first be overcome. Beyond the prime minister encouraging greater adoption, increased investment into how AI can safely and successfully augment healthcare and research is needed. Far greater collaboration across different disciplines and geographies is also needed to fully realise AI’s potential. It’s important to remember that while AI has great promise, it’s not simply a case of “plug and play”. The use of AI in healthcare will necessitate purpose-built platforms that are not only technologically advanced but scientifically nuanced. Such platforms will require huge volumes of accurate, varied, multidisciplinary data, along with many years of training and algorithm-building by human “masters”. Together, AI and science can be a force for good. If the healthcare, research and technology industries can collaborate to overcome these barriers, then the future looks bright. But all parties involved must look past the hype around AI to put in place practical steps that make its widespread adoption a reality. Dr Jabe Wilson Consulting director, Text and Data Analytics at Elsevier • I welcome the investment into AI helping to save up to 22,000 more lives a year by early diagnosis of cancer. However, the more patients that enter the cancer treatment pathway, the more we will need extra clinicians (endoscopists are already in short supply), all of whom need to be trained. We will also need more scanners, drugs, pharmacists, outpatient clinics and administrative staff, theatres, hospital beds, wards and cleaners. Can Theresa May pledge the hundreds of millions of pounds that will be needed to make this scheme worthwhile and save lives? Debbie Cameron Liverpool • It is disappointing that the chief executive of Cancer Research UK has fallen into the trap of not taking into account lead-time bias when he states that the benefit of earlier diagnosis of cancer is that “fewer people each year would die within five years of their diagnosis”. Five-year survival is measured from time of diagnosis. It is self-evident therefore that the earlier the diagnosis, the better the five-year survival figures, even if there is no gain in lifespan. In the absence of effective treatment, earlier diagnosis will simply result in more patients spending longer with the worry and anxiety of having cancer and all that the diagnosis entails in terms of invasive investigations and therapy, and the adverse effects on the patient and their family. The fight to improve the lot of patients with cancer must continue, but the numerical information on which any improvement is based must be honestly and impartially presented. Peter Trewby President, Association of North of England Physicians • I applaud the prime minister’s pledge to use artificial intelligence to detect chronic diseases earlier and hence reduce premature mortality. Although the news coverage of the announcement focused mainly on cancer, the positive implications should reach people affected by countless other treatable illnesses, where late diagnosis is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. Many rare diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a poorly known disease more often seen in women, reduce life expectancy and seriously impact a patient’s everyday life. Early detection and initiation of effective treatment are key to optimising the chances of improved survival in people with PAH. Life is valued by all patients, regardless of their disease.

          "bodyText": "Sometimes, Google is just a bit too good at carrying out its stated goal to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. Take search suggestions, the helpful feature that sees Google autocomplete phrases typed into its search engine. Type “How can I cook macaroni ...” and the site will add “cheese” on to the end, saving you six whole keystrokes. Wonderful! But it turns out there could be some less desirable implementations of the technology. The search-suggestion feature, and a similar feature that offers “related searches” at the bottom of the results page, could be helping to compromise the right to anonymity of complainants in UK rape and sexual assault cases. Type in the defendant’s name with a little extra information and the search engine may suggest related searches that include the victim’s name. It’s not the first time that Google, or one of its competitors in big tech, has been caught out after handing control to AI-driven, crowdsourced suggestions. • In 2016, Google was slammed for its search suggestion and related searches proposing hateful material. “Are Muslims …” offered up: “Are Muslims bad”. One search for that, and the next suggested search proposed simply: “Islam must be destroyed”. • In February this year, the company faced similar criticism: “Hitler is ...” led to “my hero”; even hyper-sanitised results, such as “Blacks are ...” – which has been manually scrubbed of almost any automatic suggestions – still offered “not oppressed” as an option. • Elsewhere in Google’s empire, YouTube’s search suggestions (the same technology, but operating on very different content) has had its own problems. For a brief period in November, “How to have ...” offered “s*x [sic] with your kids” as one option. These suggestions seem to be the modern equivalent of Googlebombs, joke search phrases created by thousands of people linking to a site with misleading text (for a long time, for instance, searching for “miserable failure” on Google led to the official biography of George W Bush). Enough people searching for one term can trick the algorithm into thinking it’s a real thing. • When the learning systems go wrong, they can sometimes go really wrong. Apple’s autocorrect changes every standalone lowercase “i” to an uppercase one – but for a while in 2017, the company instead “corrected” the letter to “A[?]”. Worse, if you accidentally texted the new strange autocorrect to someone else, their phone caught the bug, resulting in a short period where social media was essentially unreadable to large proportions of the iPhone-using world."

          "headline": "London hospitals to replace doctors and nurses with AI for some tasks",
          "bodyText": "One of the country’s biggest hospitals has unveiled sweeping plans to use artificial intelligence to carry out tasks traditionally performed by doctors and nurses, from diagnosing cancer on CT scans to deciding which A&amp;E patients are seen first. The three-year partnership between University College London Hospitals (UCLH) and the Alan Turing Institute aims to bring the benefits of the machine learning revolution to the NHS on an unprecedented scale. Prof Bryan Williams, director of research at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said that the move could have a major impact on patient outcomes, drawing parallels with the transformation of the consumer experience by companies such as Amazon and Google. “It’s going to be a game-changer,” he said. “You can go on your phone and book an airline ticket, decide what movies you’re going to watch or order a pizza … it’s all about AI,” he said. “On the NHS, we’re nowhere near sophisticated enough. We’re still sending letters out, which is extraordinary.” At the heart of the partnership, in which UCLH is investing a “substantial” but unnamed sum, is the belief that machine learning algorithms can provide new ways of diagnosing disease, identifying people at risk of illness and directing resources. In theory, doctors and nurses could be responsively deployed on wards, like Uber drivers gravitating to locations with the highest demand at certain times of day. But the move will also trigger concerns about privacy, cyber security and the shifting role of health professionals. The first project will focus on improving the hospital’s accident and emergency department, which like many hospitals is failing to meet government waiting time targets. “Our performance this year has fallen short of the four-hour wait, which is no reflection on the dedication and commitment of our staff,” said Prof Marcel Levi, UCLH chief executive. “[It’s] an indicator of some of the other things in the entire chain concerning the flow of acute patients in and out the hospital that are wrong.” In March, just 76.4% of patients needing urgent care were treated within four hours at hospital A&amp;E units in England in March – the lowest proportion since records began in 2010. Using data taken from thousands of presentations, a machine learning algorithm might indicate, for instance, whether a patient with abdomen pain was likely to be suffering from a severe problem, like intestinal perforation or a systemic infection, and fast-track those patients preventing their condition from becoming critical. “Machines will never replace doctors, but the use of data, expertise and technology can radically change how we manage our services – for the better,” said Levi. Another project, already underway, aims to identify patients who are are likely to fail to attend appointments. A consultant neurologist at the hospital, Parashkev Nachev, has used data including factors such as age, address and weather conditions to predict with 85% accuracy whether a patient will turn up for outpatient clinics and MRI scans. In the next phase, the department will trial interventions, such as sending reminder texts and allocating appointments to maximise chances of attendance. “We’re going to test how well it goes,” said Williams. “Companies use this stuff to predict human behaviour all the time.” Other projects include applying machine learning to the analysis of the CT scans of 25,000 former smokers who are being recruited as part of a research project and looking at whether the assessment of cervical smear tests can be automated. “There are people who have to look at those all day to see if it looks normal or abnormal,” said Williams. Might staff resent ceding certain duties to computers – or even taking instructions from them? Prof Chris Holmes, director for health at the Alan Turing Institute, said the hope is that doctors and nurses will be freed up to spend more time with patients. “We want to take out the more mundane stuff which is purely information driven and allow time for things the human expert is best at,” he said. When implementing new decision-making tools, the hospital will need to guard against “learned helplessness”, where people become so reliant on automated instructions that they abandon common sense. While an algorithm might be correct 99.9% of the time, according to Holmes, “once in a blue moon it makes a howler”. “You want to quantify the risk of that,” he added. UCLH is aiming to circumvent privacy concerns that have overshadowed previous collaborations, including that of the Royal Free Hospital in London and Google’s DeepMind, in which the hospital inadvertently shared the health records of 1.6 million identifiable patients. Under the new partnership, algorithms will be trained on the hospital’s own servers to avoid any such breaches and private companies will not be involved, according to Holmes. “We’re critically aware of patient sensitivity of data governance,” he said. “Any algorithms we develop will be purely in-house.” Questions also remain about the day-to-day reality of integrating sophisticated AI software with hospital IT systems, which are already criticised for being clunky and outdated. And there will be concerns about whether the move to transfer decision-making powers to algorithms would make hospitals even more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Hospital IT systems were brought to a standstill last year after becoming victim to a global ransomware attack that resulted in operations being cancelled, ambulances being diverted and patient records being unavailable. Williams acknowledged that adapting NHS IT systems would be a challenge, but added “if this works and we demonstrate we can dramatically change efficiency, the NHS will have to adapt.”"

          "bodyText": "The rest of the world is baffled by Britain – and understandably so. In the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, directed by Danny Boyle, we dramatised a confidence, openness and multiplicity that only a nation at ease with itself could muster. The global “soft power” of our language, cultural and scientific institutions, and international development programmes – still ringfenced by the Treasury – remains formidable. And on Saturday, hundreds of millions around the world watched the royal wedding: as glorious a fusion of pageantry and pluralism, of monarchy and modernity, as you could hope for. Yet this spirit of generous self-assurance has its evil twin. We are also the country of Brexit; of Nigel Farage; of Jacob Rees-Mogg posing outside No 10 to deliver a petition demanding cuts to the aid budget; and, most recently and shamefully, of the Windrush scandal. Which is the authentic Britain? Open or closed? Warm or frostily parochial? Both, I suppose. Most countries are, to use a word much-loved by Nick Clegg, “bicephalous”: two-headed and contradictory. The question we should ask in 2018 is: which of the two heads dominates? On my travels in the past year, I have encountered understandable confusion about our national trajectory. To crunch a complex series of perceptions into a seriously oversimplified narrative, the view from beyond our shores runs as follows: Britain was in terrible shape in 1979. Margaret Thatcher’s shock therapy, painful for a great many, laid the foundations of renewed national prosperity. Labour’s election in 1997 marked a determination to match economic growth with social justice and liberalism. According to this happy version of events, the 2012 Olympics represented the culmination of more than three decades of regenerative work: a global festival in which Britain declared itself to be both open for business and open in spirit. Into which narrative, the rusty spanner of Brexit was thrown with clanking ferocity four years later. Suddenly, Britain was declaring its furious hostility to “mass immigration”, to its putative imprisonment as a “vassal state”, to the supposed mutilation of its island heritage. Optimism had yielded to fear. We were, to quote Nigel Farage’s vile poster, at “breaking point”. You can forgive the rest of the world its perplexity. When, exactly, did Britain decide angry nativism was the way forward? This global confusion about who we are and what we want has profoundly practical consequences. Ask any senior diplomat or chief executive and they will tell you the same thing: namely, that technical detail forms the structure of any deal, alliance or treaty, but that the much more nebulous question of culture, shared ideals and emotional identity determines the foundation. Trade agreements and investment decisions are not decided by algorithm alone. Each side must ask: what sort of partner am I aligning myself with? Will my employees be heading towards an outstretched hand or a “hostile environment”? If I had to single out the principal cause of our national identity crisis, I would cite the catastrophic absence of leadership on immigration policy. The issue has maddened us, unnecessarily and tragically. It has drained much of our national confidence, made us mean, bred an uncharitable insularity. In their words, deeds and tactical silences, politicians of both main parties have allowed a series of myths to enter and settle into mainstream discourse: that migrants depress wages and take jobs from indigenous citizens; that migrants are a drain on the taxpayer; that only the “metropolitan elite” benefits from migrant labour; that migrants are more likely to commit crimes. All this is rubbish, and deserves to be robustly and repeatedly dismissed as such – not left to fester in the national consciousness. I also believe immigration is culturally enriching. But then I have skin in the game (the surname is a clue). So let us concentrate on economic necessity. A familiar refrain of pro-Brexit MPs is that their constituents were somehow “not consulted” on recent immigration. To which the only answer should be: oh yes they were. They were consulted when they voted repeatedly for an NHS that has the capacity to treat them – an objective that would be unthinkable without migrant labour. They made a decision in favour of immigration when they opted for low-price consumer goods, for rapid delivery services, for facilities and shops that are open around the clock. They chose. We all did. It is outrageous hypocrisy to pretend otherwise. In cabinet, I am told, even the arch-Brexiteers declare that national prosperity should not be sacrificed to the achievement of arbitrarily low net migration targets. Well, thanks a lot. Now they spot the flaw in the plan. To be fair to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, he has repeatedly conceded that immigration policy post-Brexit will require many exemptions to meet the needs of the labour market. And as for all those shiny trade deals we are promised after 29 March 2019: the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told a Commons committee in February that visas could “absolutely” be exchanged for commercial access in future negotiations. Brexit encapsulates this cognitive dissonance and its damaging consequences: it is about much more than our institutional relationship with the EU. I long for political leaders with the courage and candour to declare that the great challenges facing this country – automation, fiscal fairness, entrenched poverty, human longevity – have nothing to do with immigration, race or the much-needed influx of newcomers. That it has taken a royal wedding to reinstate this straightforward truth should shame our drab political class. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"

Ending random jams A recent paper published in Transportation Research found that autonomous cars could bring about the end of congestion with no obvious explanation. These are caused by one driver’s unexpected behaviour (most often braking) being copied and exaggerated by following vehicles. The study demonstrated the networked cars were able to slow more gently and not create jams. Self-learning brains A recent study published in Nature from Google-backed AI company Deepmind claims to have developed an AI program that resembles the neural GPS system found inside the brain. At present, its algorithm can only work in mazes but it plans to test it in more “challenging environments”. No more motion sickness Driving helps mitigate motion sickness by making us engaged with the experience of movement. But passengers in an autonomous car will find it hard to anticipate movement and could feel queasy. Boston startup ClearMotion is working on shock absorbers that will counter the feeling of movement – thereby, it hopes, reducing the need for sick bags. Robot taxis Earlier this month, BMW demonstrated a self-driving 7 Series that pedestrians could hail and direct to their destination via a tablet. In a rather analogue touch, passengers were also allowed to honk the car horn to alert pedestrians and stray dogs to their self-driving presence."

          "bodyText": "Between 2001 and 2015, sales of translated fiction grew by 96%. One reason, argues Daniel Hahn, who last year established a prize for first translations, is that publishers seem to be taking more account of what people actually want to read. For a long time, he says, the emphasis was on “quite challenging, highbrow literary fiction,” which led to an unhelpful conflation of “difficult” with “translated”. Then Christoper MacLehose published Stieg Larsson’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which promptly sold 12,000 copies, in hardback. “It seems to me,” says Lisa Appignanesi, chair of this year’s Man Booker international prize, which is announced on 22 May, “we have become much more interested in literature which is not conventional; there are different traditions on the continent, which are not quite so emphatically led by character and the movement of plot.” The important thing, then, is to be led by readers. Colm Tóibín, when not writing his own fiction, commissions books for a tiny imprint called Tuskar Rock. Two of their translated books are shortlisted for this year’s Booker international prize – Like a Fading Shadow by Spanish author Antonio Muñoz Molina and The World Goes On, by Hungarian novelist Laszlo Krasznahorkai. Some years ago, Tóibín was asked to introduce Krasznahorkai at a reading in Edinburgh, and “noticed that the venue was full”. At which point he realised that readers in English were no longer getting their information about books from traditional sources, and that it was important to work out how they were doing it and “try to tap into it”. So, in that spirit, we have looked around Europe – in this year when we are preparing to leave it for ever – to find out what Europeans are reading, and what we’ll be reading next. Aida Edemariam FRANCE: Gaël Faye The rapper-turned-writer Faye was 13 when he wrote his first poem. It was March 1995, and he had already lived through two years of civil war in the tiny east African nation of Burundi – sitting in school while gunshots rang out, navigating neighbourhoods carved up by rival ethnic gangs, seeing the remains of bodies burned alive in the street. “I started writing because I was scared,” Faye says. “We were living in hell. Writing did me a lot of good.” Days later, Faye’s French father put his children on an emergency repatriation plane to France. When Faye eventually began a new life in a Paris suburb near Versailles, he was weighed down by war and trauma, navigating all the race and identity issues of discrimination in the banlieues. By his 20s, Faye was a successful hip-hop artist. It was a literary editor in Paris, whose son listened to Faye’s music, who suggested he consider fiction. The result – Petit Pays (Small Country) – his first novel, about a 10-year-old who comes of age during the Burundi civil war, has become a bestseller in France, leading to literary prizes and translation deals across the world. Its page-turning appeal lies in its deceptively gentle style: there is the tinkling of cutlery on plates, the mother silently massaging her temples, while beyond the front door, ethnic violence creeps up like a rising tide. It is a window into the minds of families forced to flee conflict. There are flashes of the young narrator’s adult life in a “dormitory town” outside Paris, where he sits in a bar watching refugees arriving on boats on the TV news, thinking: “What about the country inside them? No one ever mentions that.” In the living room of his neat Paris flat, Faye is on a break from his current hip-hop tour. At 36, he still raps and makes music, although he is now better known for his novel and is working on two new pieces of fiction. Well liked in the music industry for his politeness and calm, Faye dislikes the rapper-turned-novelist label. He prefers to call himself simply a writer who moves between different forms. “There’s so much cliche around rap. I didn’t want people to presume a rapper would write a book in rhyme with style effects, full of alliteration and wordplay. There’s more freedom in writing a novel than the music style I work in, with its strict rhythm-rhyme format. Writing a novel is like being in the middle of an ocean and choosing where you want to float, but a song is like a flowing river: there are river banks and you have to stay inside them.” In the novel, the father of the young central character, Gabriel, believes children should stay out of politics. “But we couldn’t help it,” the 10-year-old narrator says. “The atmosphere was becoming weirder by the day.” The Hutu-Tutsi ethnic conflict in Burundi and the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda that killed up to a million people, is – from an inquisitive child’s point of view – terrifyingly absurd. Did the Hutus and Tutsis fall out because they didn’t speak the same language? No. Didn’t share the same god? No. Then why, the child wonders. “Because they don’t have the same nose,” he is told. Like Faye’s own mother, the narrator’s mother is Rwandan, from the Tutsi minority, and had fled to Burundi during the pogroms of the 1960s, then lost family in the 1994 genocide. As an adult, the mixed-race Gabriel is asked by women on dates in Paris to define his identity. “Human being,” he replies. But the novel shows that no matter how hard you try to sidestep it, war tries to designate you an enemy. Faye wanted to evoke what it’s like to live in wartime, when murder becomes part of everyday life. “When I was small, we went to the cinema and saw American war films – Rambo, Chuck Norris movies. And we always thought war was explosions everywhere and buildings falling down,” he says. “But in fact war can also be a life. You still go to school, you still obey your parents and, at the same time, there are people who are being lynched in the street, you see people burned to death when you’re on your way to collect a letter or buy bread … You live on adrenaline, with permanent fear – it’s hard for a child to have the notion they could die at any moment. When I arrived in France, I noticed that compared to my classmates, I didn’t have the naivety of childhood. It had made me serious.” Faye began writing Small Country in 2015. It was the Paris terrorist attacks of that year that gave him the idea of setting his novel in a calm cul-de-sac in a comfortable area of the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, somewhere that seems shut off from the war, but isn’t. “The dead-end street where the children play – a place you feel protected,” Faye says. “But feeling protected is a trap, it stops you seeing the world as it really is. “The Paris attacks showed that you could go to a concert, you could go for dinner on a restaurant terrace, and suddenly you could die,” he says. And the next day, some people were back at restaurant terraces, life continued. That’s what war was like for us, it was like that every day for two years in Burundi, and I imagine in some countries – Lebanon, Iraq – people live that for years and years. You have to understand how that wears down your nerves. You grow old much quicker. That fear – week in, week out – ends up changing you profoundly.” It was hard for Faye to talk about the war in Burundi to his mother, who had escaped violence in Rwanda and lived as a refugee. “She would say: ‘It’s the past, you have to look forward.’” That silence and his inability to speak his mother’s native language pained him, but ultimately led to the novel. “If I had really been able to talk to my mum, there wouldn’t have been that irresistible desire to write in order to understand.” He wanted to show how war creeps up. “Before the violence, it’s there in words, gestures, in attitudes, relationships. It’s never a sudden explosion. And if we’re not vigilant, with the words we use, political decisions, war can happen.” Small Country – like much of Faye’s hip-hop – is also about race. Irritated by society’s definition of mixed race as something that is “50-50”, Faye, whose French father is white and Rwandan mother is black, prefers to see mixed race identity as 100%, a whole. He feels African, European, French, Rwandan, Burundian all at the same time. In the novel, the mixed race child Gabriel moves between settings as an insider-outsider. “It’s as if you belong without really belonging,” says Faye. “It’s almost like a reader, who belongs to the story but doesn’t belong to the story. I found that interesting: to have a character who wasn’t on one side or the other, but on the border.” Faye briefly lived in London in his 20s, where he worked for an investment fund, and recently relocated for a while to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, to experience a new Rwanda, beyond his family’s story of the genocide. But much of his hip-hop is about French society and its identity problems – a society that has turned in on itself, stigmatising those with immigrant roots. “I’m ill at ease with the idea of a country that promotes such great values through its literature and ideas and at the same time has seen a growing intolerance. France is at a crossroads. It was built by people from all over the world. To forget that is to forget what it is to be French.” Faye still hasn’t returned to those first poems he wrote in the days before fleeing Burundi. “They are in a box at my mum’s house. When I was writing Small Country I wondered if I should reread them, but I was afraid to. I didn’t want the book to be an autobiography and I wanted people to be able to understand it even if they weren’t from Burundi or Rwanda.” He takes a breath. “Maybe I’ll reread them one day, but not right now.” Angelique Chrisafis • Small Country, translated by Sarah Ardizzone, is published by Hogarth on 7 June. NORWAY: Vigdis Hjorth The controversial family saga Hjorth is a highly respected novelist with a 30‑year career. Like her fellow Norwegian Karl Ove Knausgaard, whose six-volume work My Struggle became an international phenomenon, Hjorth often uses her own life as inspiration. Arv og miljø (Wills and Testaments), published in Norway in 2016, is a family drama about the settling of a father’s will, told by the family’s eldest daughter, now a middle-aged woman. The settlement is overshadowed by memories of being abused by her father when she was five. The book was praised when it came out in 2016. “Hjorth parcels out the secrets with a precision worthy of Ibsen,” wrote Ingunn Økland, chief reviewer at Aftenposten. But it was also controversial. Norway is a small country, and people who knew Hjorth’s family thought they recognised many of the events and characters depicted. This was a novel that people could enjoy either as high literature or as a work of down-and-dirty revenge. The tabloids loved it as much as the broadsheets, and it became the bestselling novel of the year. The narrator’s sisters do not come out of it well. They collude with the father and refuse to believe the narrator’s story of abuse. They are rewarded for their silence; each receives a holiday cabin in the father’s will. The narrator does not. Hjorth’s younger sister Helga was appalled. “I recognised everything the reviews described: the cabins in Toffelsø; the arguments about the will and the valuations … [everything] was taken from our life, from my life.” Helga considered suing for defamation, but although she is a lawyer, it’s very hard to prove libel in a Norwegian court. Instead she took a writing course and wrote her own novel, Fri vilje (Free Will). In Helga Hjorth’s version, the facts remain largely the same, but this time her father is innocent, and her famous sister is a troublemaker. In August 2017, a year after Wills and Testaments was published, Free Will topped the book charts in Norway. Everyone was talking about it, comparing it with the original. “This is the novel in weaponised form,” said the national broadcaster’s arts correspondent Agnes Moxnes. Vigdis Hjorth is sanguine about her sister’s score-settling. For her it simply confirms the central point of her own novel: that one person’s reality is another person’s lie. Ben McPherson • Wills and Testaments, translated by Charlotte Barslund, will be published by Verso. SPAIN: Fernando Aramburu The political blockbuster Is Aramburu the Tolstoy of the Basque country, author of a Spanish language War and Peace that lays bare the pain of 40 pointless years of separatist terrorism? Or is he a Spanish JM Coetzee, publicly self-flagellating about the hypocrisies of one of the country’s most prosperous but also most intolerant regions? The 58-year-old novelist has been compared to both – thanks to a blockbusting 640-page saga of the Basque conflict, Patria (homeland), which has sold 700,000 copies, is in development as an HBO series (in Spanish) and has just won the Strega Europeo award in Italy. When it came to opposing dictator Francisco Franco, the militant Basque separatists of Eta were among the few to pick up weapons. It was they who assassinated Franco’s heir apparent, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco. Despite an amnesty, however, Eta did not give up violence when democracy arrived in the 1970s. The bloody inertia that provoked more than 800 deaths after that is the subject of Aramburu’s book, set in a small town where Eta and its violent supporters exercise almost totalitarian control. With this book, which has spent 18 months on Spain’s bestseller lists, Aramburu has become a key player in a battle to control the narrative about recent Basque history. While some still see Eta’s members as valiant militants and martyrs, he sides with the victims – policemen, politicians, judges, journalists and those who fought the asphyxiating conformity imposed on the heartland towns and villages near San Sebastián. The heroes in Patria are those who either resist or wake up to Eta’s moral redundancy. Aramburu himself has talked of seeking Eta’s “literary defeat” (adding to its political defeat, since the group disbanded earlier this month). Critics accuse him of creating a blunt political instrument whose simplistic moralising relies on stereotypical characters. Others, however, praise his literary skill. Six hundred-page novels are not usually easy to digest, but Patria – divided into more than 100 short chapters – can be binge-read. Perhaps the test will be whether it transcends cultural frontiers. Giles Tremlett • Patria, English translator TBC, will be published by Picador in spring 2019. GERMANY: JULI ZEH The tech dystopia German literature, once notorious for digging through the past in search of answers to the 20th century’s unanswerables, is becoming increasingly fixated on the future. Juli Zeh’s 2016 novel Unterleuten (Among-people) demonstrated her talent for turning social debates into bestsellers, and she has been described by Deutschlandradio as the rightful heir to Günther Grass and Heinrich Böll. Her latest book is Leere Herzen (Empty Hearts). In the year 2025, Angela Merkel has resigned in the face of the rise of a so-called “Concerned Citizens Movement”. The UN is about to be dissolved, Frexit is in the air and Continuity Occupy and Bavarian separatists are planning terrorist attacks. But psychotherapist Britta Söldner and her colleague Babak Hamwi find that even suicide bombings can be monetised: their agency The Bridge uses a powerful algorithm to scrape wannabe jihadis from social media networks and match them with fundamentalist organisations. “As the republic’s first and only terror service provider, The Bridge has pacified and stabilised its trade,” Britta reports proudly. “They provide the necessary level of threat that every society needs.” Leading highbrow weekly Die Zeit has described Empty Hearts as the German equivalent of Michel Houellebecq’s dystopian fantasy Submission. Its success seems to suggest that in the country whose handling of the 2015 refugee crisis divided its population and much of the rest of the world, fears about modern technology loom just as large. Philip Oltermann • Empty Hearts, English translator TBC, will be published by Knopf Doubleday in 2019. ITALY: Paolo Cognetti The mountain hermit Mountain literature hasn’t always been a fashionable genre in Italian publishing. In recent years, though, Italy’s Alpine books have become astonishingly successful. Mauro Corona, who lives in a half-abandoned hamlet in the Dolomites, has become a prolific writer and proselytiser for primitive living. And last year’s Strega prize was won by Le otto montagne (The Eight Mountains), Paolo Cognetti’s enchanting story of a boy who comes of age at altitude. In Italy (a country with low levels of books sales) it has sold 320,000 copies, and rights have been sold in 38 countries. Touted by some as the new Elena Ferrante, Cognetti’s life story has added to the appeal of the book. At 30, weary of city life and moved by Into the Wild – the true story of an American hiker who disappeared into the Alaskan wilderness – he left Milan and went to live as a hermit at over 6,000 feet above sea level. In the resulting memoir, Il Ragazzo Selvatico (The Wild Child), he meets gruff, timeless characters, and his writing takes on their blunt honesty: “there’s no wilderness in the Alps,” he wrote, “but a long history of human presence”. Cognetti duly became a sort of amateur archaeologist, analysing the traces of that human presence and gently adding to it. The Eight Mountains is set in very similar territory: it’s about an ascent to a space where there are no “lords, armies, priests”. The book’s popularity lies partly in its elemental romanticism: civilisation has been so stripped away that skiers look like “aliens” and the only thing that stops cows being human is their lack of a voice. But it’s also become a bestseller because Italy is undergoing something of an identity crisis. Most people complain that the country is in terminal economic decline and that modernity isn’t all it was cracked up to be. There’s a growing back-to-the-land movement, with endless newspaper articles about, for example, a new generation of shepherds: educated Italians who are leaving conurbations to head to the hills and look after sheep. That, in some ways, is what Cognetti is doing: he toils at altitude, and tries to preserve Italy’s past for its future. Tobias Jones • The Eight Mountains, translated by Erica Segre and Simon Carnell, is published by Vintage. CROATIA: Daša Drndić The literary historian Reading Daša Drndić is not for the faint hearted. Even Seid Serdarević, Drndić’s publisher at the publishing house Fraktura, describes the experience of reading her books as “being emotionally punched in the stomach all the time”. Nevertheless, the 71-year-old Croatian author is beginning to achieve fame outside her homeland for novels that deal with some of the darker episodes of 20th-century history, and issues of memories and forgetting. Drndić has been writing since the 1980s, but came to prominence with her 2007 novel Trieste. She followed it up with Belladonna in 2012, and both are now available in English. Belladonna is ostensibly the story of the ageing Andreas Ban and his battle with cancer. Ban is “a psychologist who does not psychologise any more. A writer who no longer writes … a tourist guide who no longer guides anyone anywhere.” The first 40 pages, in which Ban receives his diagnosis, are a relentless portrayal of “repugnant” physical decay. But it is the deterioration of memories that is quickly established as the book’s main theme. The novel switches between various periods in Ban’s life, and dances from one historical tragedy to another – from the second world war, to communism, to sectarianism in the 1990s Balkan wars. Ban, as Drndić once was, is a Croat living in Belgrade, who, as ethnic tensions mount, finds he is an outsider both in Serbia and Croatia. Drndić’s novels, with their literary retellings of 20th century history and fictionalised characters musing over factual events, have drawn comparisons to WG Sebald. Real people, too, make frequent appearances, most notably the list of over 2,000 children, spanning 15 pages, who were deported from the Netherlands to concentration camps by the Nazis. “It is precisely about things which it is impossible to speak of that one must speak,” believes Ban. Anger radiates from Drndić’s pages, and perhaps the book’s greatest strength is the way in which it gives a voice to those people who are unable to tell their own stories. Shaun Walker • Belladonna, translated by Celia Hawkesworth is published by MacLehose. POLAND: Olga Tokarczuk The Booker nominee She is by no means an overtly political writer, yet Tokarczuk’s work has come to be seen as an implicit challenge to the incumbent Law and Justice party’s (PiS) steady erosion of human rights. Though it is her novel Bieguni (Flights) that has been shortlisted for next week’s Man Booker international prize, it is Prowadź swój pług przez kości umarłych (Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead) that is back in the spotlight, thanks to Pokot (Spoor), a film adaptation by Agnieszka Holland. The novel, whose title is taken from a line in William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, is narrated by Janina Duszejko, a 60-something former engineer, now an English teacher and caretaker of dilapidated summer homes along the Czech-Polish border. “I love crossing borders,” she declares, about life on the other side, where “the language isn’t suited to quarrelling” – unlike in her own country, “a land of neurotic egotists”. Indeed, the novel is haunted by an acute awareness of how language is used to manipulate us. Though Duszejko is having none of it. An ostensibly humble vigilante, she has a way with words, writing to the authorities to deplore their lack of action and accountability, and awarding her friends monikers such as “Oddball” and “Good News”. To perceive and cultivate difference, to rename, she believes, are simple means of resistance. Duszejko’s deep concern for the natural environment manifests itself in a fierce anti-hunting stance allied to an increasingly desperate lament for the decimation of her country’s very own “green and pleasant land”. Her conviction clearly speaks to Polish readers: at recent demonstrations against the logging of the Białowieża forest, one banner read, “Janina Duszejko won’t forgive you!” James Hopkin • Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones is due out from Fitzcarraldo Editions in September. The winner of the Man Booker International prize will be announced on 22 May."

          "headline": "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote review – Terry Gilliam's epic journey finds a joyous end",
          "bodyText": "Terry Gilliam has brought to Cannes his long-gestated and epically delayed movie version of Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote, a biblical ordeal of wrecked sets, collapsed funding and bad luck that has outlived two of the actors once cast – John Hurt and Jean Rochefort – and which has been attended by colossal legal acrimony and brinkmanship right up to the red-carpet steps themselves, as the former backer Paulo Branco sought to injunct its showing here as closing gala. A French court found against Branco last week, but its screening here has been prefaced by a solemn lawyerly announcement respecting Mr Branco’s future claims. It’s a backstory of enormous drama, well told in Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe’s documentary Lost in La Mancha, all the way back in 2002, when it looked as if Gilliam’s Quixote film, like Orson Welles’, would never be made. Well, hooray for Gilliam’s energy and self-belief because now it has got made, co-scripted with Tony Grisoni, and although it doesn’t have the visually ambitious and even revolutionary style of Brazil and 12 Monkeys – nor the hard edge of my own favourite of his later films, Tideland from 2006 – it is a film of sweet gaiety and cheerful good nature, an interesting undertow of poignancy, and with a lovely leading turn from Jonathan Pryce as the chivalric legend himself and roistering action scenes pleasantly like Richard Lester’s Three Musketeers movies from the 1970s. It’s almost like a children’s movie, in fact – and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is a film with a sentimental respect for its source material – but Gilliam has new and vigorous insights to offer. It’s as if he is politely waving away our obvious view that he is a Quixote figure tilting indefatigably at movie-business windmills. No, the key player here is Sancho Panza: the servant, the enabler, the rational sceptic whose detachment is faltering, the sorcerer’s apprentice who doesn’t realise that he is being inducted into a mysterious art of creative self-delusion. As befits Cervantes’ daringly postmodern novel, in whose latter part Quixote is aware of being a famous figure because of the publication of the first part, Gilliam’s Quixote is multilayered. Adam Driver plays Toby, the arrogant and overpaid ad director who has been given the chance to make a feature and has opted for Don Quixote. We see him filming in Spain, shooting the giants/windmills scene and enduring those same nightmares of delay that famously tried Gilliam’s faith and have become mythic expressions of imagination and reality. The movie is being bankrolled by an obnoxious, racist businessman, played by Stellan Skarsgård, whose jaded wife, Jacqui (Olga Kurylenko), tries to seduce Toby. Skarsgård’s mogul is in hock to a sinister Russian oligarch, Alexei (Jordi Mollà), who has a huge castle and is given to throwing fancy-dress parties and staging various dramatic events. But in the midst of his ennui and cynicism, Toby is suddenly galvanised: he chances upon a bootleg DVD of his first film: a lo-fi, black-and-white indie that was an adaptation of … Don Quixote. He remembers his passion and idealism, and how he used local non-professionals to make it. His star was a kindly old shoemaker, played by Jonathan Pryce. While shooting is on suspension, Toby journeys to the nearby village to discover what has happened to his old star, and is astonished to discover that the experience of that film completely unhinged the man – or rather it gave him an energy and passion that he never had before. He now believes that he is Don Quixote, striding around looking for worlds to conquer and wrongs to right, his overwhelming vocational energy carrying him along. The bewildered Toby, overstressed and not used to the blazing heat, starts to become his Sancho Panza, losing his grip on boring old reality. It’s a nice premise – similar, perhaps, to Dennis Hopper’s 1971 cult film The Last Movie, about a film-shoot in Peru creating a new kind of ritualistic culture. Pryce has exactly the right daft pomposity and wide-eyed credulity, believing in his own publicity, his own mythology. Driver creates a pretty straightforward character, aggressive, sweary and without much in the way of nuance. As he starts to lose it, his arrogant Americanness starts to curdle and he begins to fantasise that Moroccan illegals are jihadi terrorists, and hallucinates a visit from the Spanish Inquisition (surely Gilliam was tempted to add a line on whether they were expected), antisemitic bigots whose prejudice affords Toby an insight into his own heatstruck paranoia. Joana Ribeiro is interesting as Angelica, herself ruined by being cast as a teenager in Toby’s movie, and who endured 10 long years of disillusionment in showbusiness before returning to her home town, where the poor shoemaker now thinks that she is his Dulcinea. It may not be Gilliam’s masterpiece, but it is a movie with sprightliness, innocence and charm and it is a morale boost to anyone who cares about creativity that Gilliam has got the film made at all. His own intelligence and joy in his work shine out of every frame, and his individuality is a delight when so much of mainstream cinema seems to have been created by algorithm. What a dull place the world would be without Terry Gilliam."

          "headline": "Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says Bannon wanted to suppress voters",
          "bodyText": "Former White House senior strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire Robert Mercer sought Cambridge Analytica’s political ad targeting technology as part of an “arsenal of weapons to fight a culture war”, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie. “Steve Bannon believes that politics is downstream from culture. They were seeking out companies to build an arsenal of weapons to fight a culture war,” Wylie said, when asked why investors thought that the political consultancy’s efforts would work, targeting people based on psychological profiles and assessment of their personality. The pink-haired 28-year-old was appearing to give evidence on Capitol Hill for the first time since his decision to blow the whistle on the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica set off shock waves that are still reverberating through Westminster, Washington DC and Silicon Valley. During his testimony to the Senate judiciary committee, Wylie also confirmed that he believed one of the goals of Steve Bannon while he was vice-president of Cambridge Analytica was voter suppression. “One of the things that provoked me to leave was discussions about ‘voter disengagement’ and the idea of targeting African Americans,” he said, noting he had seen documents referencing this. Facebook posts were targeted at some black voters reminding them of Hillary Clinton’s 1990s description of black youths as “super predators”, in the hope it would deter them from voting. Wylie also explained why Cambridge Analytica was testing messages such as “drain the swamp” and “build the wall” in 2014, before the Trump campaign existed. “The company learned that there were segments of the populace that were responsive to these messages that weren’t necessarily reflected in other polling,” he said. The whistleblower previously revealed to the Observer that the political consultancy used the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook profiles to help Donald Trump’s election and the Brexit leave campaign. The revelation triggered a public debate over privacy and micro-targeted advertising, and led Facebook to overhaul the way it works with third-party researchers and app developers. Wylie was joined by two academics, Mark Jamison from the University of Florida, who focuses on how technology impacts the economy, and political scientist Eitan Hersh from Tufts University. Hersh did not believe that Cambridge Analytica’s approach was successful at persuading people to vote differently during the 2016 presidential election. “It’s hard to move people. It’s easier to mobilise or demobilise than it is to persuade people,” he said. Wylie agreed, but noted that Cambridge Analytica had a treasure trove of “dense and valuable” data compared with traditional marketing approaches that allowed it to create a “precise algorithm”. Many of the senators’ questions focused on Facebook and other internet companies’ business models and whether individuals were aware of the degree of privacy invasion they are subjected to. Senator Kamala Harris of California said that Facebook’s business model was not always working “in the best interest of the American people”. “Users have little to no idea of just how Facebook tracks their information,” she said. “In the real world, this would be like someone following you as you walk down the street, watching who you are, where you’re going, and who you’re with. For most people, this would be an invasion of privacy and most people would call the cops.” Wylie said that Facebook has created a platform that encourages the abuse of people’s privacy. “It’s true you can’t buy Facebook’s data but they make it readily available to its customers via its applications,” he said. He added that the way Facebook profiles are designed makes it “conducive to scraping data” and that this is a setup that “catalyses its misuse”. Throughout the committee hearing, several Republican senators including Ted Cruz and Thom Tillis pointed to the Obama campaign’s use of Facebook data, to highlight the fact that such practices are bipartisan. However, people who downloaded the Obama campaign app were aware they were using a political app. By contrast, the data obtained by Cambridge Analytica was obtained via a personality quiz application whose users had no idea their data would be used by a political campaign. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, joined Strategic Communication Laboratories Group (SCL) in 2013. Shortly after, he came up with an idea that led to the creation of an offshoot called Cambridge Analytica, which offered predictive analytics, behavioural sciences and data-driven advertising technology to political campaigns and businesses. Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the personal information of millions of Facebook users to build profiles of US voters in order to target them with personalised political advertisements, via a related UK-based entity called SCL Elections. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” said Wylie in March. “And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.” Wylie has previously told MPs at a British select committee that the EU referendum was won through fraud after Vote Leave allegedly used a network of companies to get round election spending laws. He said he thought there “could have been a different outcome had there not been, in my view, cheating”. He also met privately with House Democrats in April, but Wednesday’s hearing was his first public appearance before US lawmakers. Wylie worked with Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan to obtain data from Facebook users and their friends including likes, activities, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics and relationship details. A year later the Guardian published an article revealing that Cambridge Analytica was using the Facebook data to target voters for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. At the time Facebook removed the personality quiz app, and demanded certifications from Kogan, Wylie and Cambridge Analytica that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica closed down in early May, denying any wrongdoing, but saying that the negative media coverage left it with no clients and mounting legal fees. This week the New York Times reported that the department of justice and FBI have begun investigating the now-defunct political consultancy."

          "headline": "Cambridge Analytica whistleblower appears before Senate – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of Christopher Wylie’s appearance before the Senate judiciary committee. For close observers of the Cambridge Analytica story, there was little new information disclosed in this hearing. Since going public in the Observer in March, Wylie has spoken to numerous media outlets and testified to Parliament, so much of what he said today was familiar. And while both Jamison and Hersh may have useful contributions to the debate about regulating social media and political advertisements, their presence at today’s seemed largely designed to allow Republican interlocutors to talk about something other than Cambridge Analytica. Still, Wylie is an effective communicator about the complexities of data and privacy, and his remarks on the difficulty of having true informed consent when it comes to internet platforms are important. It’s also well worth keeping in mind that political scientists like Hersh are skeptical about claims being made about the efficacy of psychographic micro-targeting. We’ll have a full report on the day’s proceedings from my colleague Olivia Solon shortly. And we’re done! Tillis closes out by entering articles about the Obama campaigns use of data into the record. Tillis: We can talk about all the bad [social media platforms] have done, but I can also talk about the good they have done in crowdsourcing and preventing suicides. Klobuchar on the Facebook algorithm: The message I’m getting is that if you want to do a moderate, policy based post, you better pay to promote it. But if you do something really partisan, it will get a lot of engagement. Klobuchar is asking about the power of FB’s algorithms to suppress or promote speech. Wylie: What you’re talking about is distortion in the information that is available to people. Notes that distortion in other areas, like the financial markets, is regulated. Klobuchar: What do we know about the scope of Facebook’s data problem? How many more Cambridge Analyticas are out there? Wylie: Only Facebook knows. He notes that Facebook threatened to sue the Guardian and banned him from the platform. “We don’t require car companies to make unsafe cars and just put terms and conditions on the outside... We have rules that require safety and to put people first... In the 21st century it is nearly impossible for people to be functional without the use of the internet, so there should be some degree of accountability and oversight.” Wylie: I never directly communicated with Facebook about that project until I left the company. My understanding is that Aleksandr Kogan did communicate with Facebook. Blumenthal: In my questioning of Zuckerberg, I showed him the terms of service that showed Facebook was on notice of what Kogan was collecting. Wylie: What I do know is that if you set up an app on FB, you have to submit the terms of service for review. So Facebook was notified, whether or not they bothered to read the terms and conditions, sort of like how many users don’t read the ToS, is another matter. Blumenthal: Did CA provide “in kind” services to US candidates? Wylie says not that he knows of, but that Mercer’s investment in the firm made it possible for CA to charge less for services than it would have. Blumenthal is suggesting that this could be a non-disclosed campaign donation. Wylie says this was an “ancillary benefit” of Mercer’s investments, such that his money could support CA’s clients without being reported as a donation. Whitehouse is now asking about an individual who played a key role in connecting CA with BlackCube, and says she’s the same person who connected the Nigeria project and LeaveEU. Wylie: The person you are referencing played a role in setting up the activity in Nigeria, which involved hacked material. Whitehouse says this was Black Cube, the Israeli firm. Wylie: She made introductions between a group of Israelis and SCL. Wylie says Whitehouse needs to ask CA about whether this was Black Cube. Whitehouse is asking about the “overspending scheme” by one of the pro-Brexit campaigns, VoteLeave. Whitehouse: Is it true that CA had zero role in the Brexit referendum? Wylie: I don’t agree with that because AIQ was set up to service Cambridge Analytica and SCL. “AIQ was only set up to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica.” To say that CA didn’t have any role of infuence on Brexit is looking at it too narrowly. And we’re back for a second round of questioning, starting with Senator Whitehouse, who is kicking us off by asking about Brexist and Aggregate IQ. While we’re waiting for the hearing to recommence... the president of the European parliament just announced that Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to appear at a closed-door meeting with MEPs in Brussels. This decision is likely to only further anger the UK parliament, which has repeatedly called on the CEO to appear. MPs have gone so far as to threaten Zuckerberg with issuing a formal summons, so if Zuckerberg does travel to Brussels next week, we imagine he won’t be flying through Heathrow. We’re taking a quick recess so the senators can vote on something. But referring back to Kennedy’s point on censorship: Facebook can and does censor what you see on the platform. Some of this censorship occurs automatically, through algorithms that promote certain posts while hiding others, depending on the various signals that Facebook uses to rank News Feed posts. Other censorship is based on the content of posts, and Facebook has only recently begun to be more transparent about how it determines what content is and is not allowed. Hersh: We have a basic human response that we are attracted to provocation and extremism, and what the platforms are doing is promoting that attraction. It’s about what we want. Kennedy: “Here’s the problem, we can all agree that poison is being spread on social media. Here’s the tough part: define poison. I don’t want Facebook censoring what I see.” We’re returning to Senator Kennedy, who already asked questions earlier. Kennedy: Did the Facebook co-founder share data with the Obama campaign that it didn’t share with the Romney campaign because he wanted Obama to win? Jamison explains that this is not true. Chris Hughes was working for the Obama campaign. But he understood how Facebook worked and was able to teach the Obama campaign how to use it. Booker: It was stunning to me that big data was used not to rally voters but to suppress voters? Was this a determined effort to suppress votes not just of African Americans or other groups? Wylie: My understanding was that it was to suppress any group of voters that would go for Democracts, especially African Americans. Booker: Was this about inflaming differences? Wylie: The US went through a civil rights movement in an attempt to desegregate society. What we’re seeing now is a resegregation of society by algorithms. Some people call that echo chambers. CA was looking to exploit certain vulnerabilites in certain segments to send them information that will remove them from the public forum, and feed them conspiracies and they’ll never see mainstream media ... We have destroyed the public forum. Wylie describes videos created by CA as “sadistic and Islamophobic”. Corey Booker, Democrat from New Jersey, is raising the New York Times’ reporting on Facebook’s role in spreading violence and misinformation in Sri Lanka. He’s now quoting SCL’s Nigel Oakes speaking approvingly of Hitler’s propaganda tools. Hirono is raising concerns about predictive technology that the government is seeking to do to forecast criminality. Wylie points out that biased data produces biased results. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat from Hawaii, addresses Hersh. Hirono: If we were to consider regulating anything, should we focus on regulating ads or messages that demobilize people. Hersh: I’ve worked for the ACLU on government voter suppression, but this is different. What’s the line for demobilization by a campaign? What if a campaign is just describing a candidate’s shortcomings? Is that demobilization? Hirono: We’re talking about people paying to suppress votes? That’s different from someone just saying don’t vote for so-and-so. Hirono seems to be suggesting that ads aimed at voter suppression could be regulated, but that seems highly questionable from a First Amendment point of view. Durbin: Did you have any guidance from CA in terms of secrecy? Wylie: Everybody had to sign a very thorough non-disclosure agreement. Durbin: Alexander Nix was clearly involved in Cambridge Analytica. Wylie: He was the CEO, so yes. Durbin: Notes that federal law prohibits the direction of campaign work by foreigh nationals: “There is a red flag, or a red Union Jack.” Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat from Illinois: I asked a question of Mr Zuckerberg, whether he felt comfortable telling me the name of the hotel that night, and after a couple seconds he said no. It really got to the heart of the issue about Mr Zuckerberg and his feelings about personal privacy and where he draws the line. The right of Facebook or any entity to use my information without my permission, I think is over the line. We have now put a little piece of electric tape over the camera on my laptop. People are watching. Wylie: Good. Harris: What should Facebook have done to ensure you deleted the data? Wylie: In 2016, they sent me a letter that requested me to delete the data and sign a certification that I did it. Harris: Did you need a notary? Wylie: No notary or legal procedure. So I signed the notification and sent it back. Harris: What specifically did Steve Bannon decide motivates or demotivates African Americans to vote? Wylie: When you poll a random sample of African Americans, they’re not the same people. Different lives, different characteristics. So you don’t treat them just as a black person, you treat them as who they are. That can be used to motivate them to vote or not to vote. Harris: So how did they decipher who was African American and target them? Wylie: Racial characteristics can be modeled. We were able to get an AUC score that was 0.89. It’s a way of measuring precision, which means it’s very high. But I didn’t participate on any voter suppression programs so I can’t comment on the specifics. Those questions are better for Steve Bannon. Harris: I believe it is government’s responsibility to create rules to yield a better bargain for Americans. Here’s Kamala Harris, Democrat from California. Harris starts by discussing the Facebook business model: This arrangement is not always working in the best interest of the American people. Users have little to no idea of just how Facebook tracks their information ... In the real world, this would be like someone following you as you walk down the street, watching who you are, where you’re going, and who you’re with. For most people, this would be an invasion of privacy and most people would call the cops. Blumenthal: Mentions that Jamison worked on the Trump transition. He asks whether Jamison had any contact with Michael Cohen. Jamison says no. Next up is Richard Blumental, Democrat from Connecticut: Are you aware of discussions between CA and representatives of the Russian government? Wylie: I’m aware of conversations with Lukoil, which has ties to the Russian government. Blumenthal: Asks about campaign donations? Wylie: After I inquired about the relatively convoluted set up of CA, what was explained to me was that when you invest money as an investor into a company that you own, it doesn’t necessarily constitute an election donation which is declarable. Blumenthal: Were you told that the purpose of the set up was to exploit this distinction? Wylie: It was explained to me as a benefit of the setup. Blumenthal: Were there firewalls set up to separate campaigns? Wylie: Not that I saw. I did see memos about separating contact between campaigns and PACs. But when I was there I did not see those instructions followed. Blumenthal: Can you provide examples of focus groups or other efforts to suppress voting? Wylie: I can work with the committee to give a fuller explanation. I am aware of research that was looked at about what motivates and demotivates people. Cruz is arguing that Facebook gives preferential treatment to Democratic campaigns. Cruz: Does anyone on the panel know what the Hillary Clinton campaign did on the data side? [crickets] This is not really surprising since none of the witnesses have any connection to her campaign. Next up is Senator Ted Cruz, another client of Cambridge Analytica. The Guardian first reported on the misappropriation of the Facebook dataset when CA was working for Cruz’s presidential campaign in December 2015. Unsurprisingly, Cruz begins his questioning by turning to Obama’s use of Facebook data in 2015. Coons: Was one of Steve Bannon’s goals to supress voting? Wylie: That was my understanding? Coons: Was voter suppression a service that clients could request? Wylie: Yes. Coons: Why was CA testing Putin’s aggressive actions? And what would it mean if Russian intelligence got this dataset? Wylie: I don’t have a clear answer for why the company was testing Russian expansionism. In terms of the dangers, data is powerful and if it’s put into the wrong hands it becomes a weapon. Companies like Facebook are not just social networking sites; they’re opportunities for information warfares, not just for state actors but also non-state actors. We have to look at protecting cyberspace just as we have agencies to protect the borders, land, space and air. Wylie: I don’t contest what Professor Hersh was saying in that it is true that persuading someone compared to motivating someone is very hard. But CA found that in comparison to traditional marketing sites, the data you can get from social media is much more dense and more valuable. Christopher Coons, Democrat from Delaware, starts by bringing up the research of Michal Kosinski on how Facebook likes can be used to predict personal traits about individuals. Wylie: The basis of what we were doing at CA was the papers by Dr Kosinski. The firm replicated his approach and sought to use it. You can get to the same level of predicting personality traits as your spouse. Hersh: I encourage my students to never share political ideas on social media. I don’t agree that you don’t have a choice not to use it. Facebook has a lot of data. I think it has acted really inappropriately, notes that they take no responsibility for how they’re used. Tillis is again discussing the use of Facebook data by the Obama campaign. This is a common talking point for Republicans who want to make the point that data use by political campaigns is bipartisan, which is true enough. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that people who downloaded the Obama campaign app were clearly aware that they were using a political app. By contrast, the Facebook data set in question here was obtained via a personality quiz application whose users would have had no idea that their data would eventually be used by a political campaign. Thom Tillis, Republican senator from North Carolina: “I hope that the result of this hearing is figuring out what if anything Congress should do with respect to a regulatory framework.” Tillis was actually a client of Cambridge Analytica in 2014. He brings this up during his questioning of Wylie. Klobuchar: What do you know about voter suppression? Wylie: One of the things that provoked me to leave was discussions about “voter disengagement” and the idea of targeting African Americans. Mentions that he has seen documents about this. Klobuchar: What states were focused on? Wylie: States that were winnable by Republicans. Klobuchar: What’s the potential overlap for users who were shown IRA ads and the users’ whose data was used by CA? Wylie: My concern is that information may have been shared or misappropriated by a Russian entity from Cambridge Analytica. It’s not just whether or not these individual records were targeted, but if it was used to build an algorithm, other uses could also have been exposed. Wylie: We should be requiring safety standards for online platforms and software. Amy Klobuchar, Democratic senator from Minnesota, raises her legislation to allow opting out of data collection. Would this legislation have prevented the Facebook data harvest? Wylie: Not really because of the API that was allowing people to pull data. Wylie: You have to imagine what the developments we’ll see moving forward. Notes that when he signed up for Facebook, it didn’t have facial recognition so he uploaded photos. Then it started scanning faces. We have to think about how data will be used in the future. Wylie: Social media is not really a choice for most people. The internet is not really a choice for most people. I don’t know a job that would let you go in and not use Google. Although we use this narrative of choice, they substantially don’t have a choice. I don’t know a job that would hire someone who refuses to use the internet. Cornyn: There’s this idea in the law that your consent must be informed. Is that too much to ask for? Wylie: People absolutely should have informed consent. But when you go and see a doctor, you consenting to surgery is proportionate to the benefit you are getting. When someone “consents” to something online, if that’s the only way you can get a job it’s not really a fair situation. We should take a step back from this narrative of consent and look at the fact that you don’t have a lot of choice. Cornyn: But I can use Twitter instead of Facebook. Wylie: Yeah, but they all do the same thing and conduct a huge amount of data comparative to the benefit they give you. Cornyn: Mark Zuckerberg kept saying that they don’t sell data, and I said they clearly rent it. How would you characterize it? Wylie: They’ve created a platform that encourages the use of data. It’s true that you can’t go to Facebook and simply buy it, but they make it readily available through network of applications, or the fact that the layout of the profiles make it very conducive to scraping data. They have a setup that catalyzes misuse in my view. Senator John Cornyn: Did CA serve all comers? Wylie: That was the impression I got at first, but after Mercer put in money, the only restriction was not to work for Democrats. Referring back to Black Cube, this is the Israeli company that was reportedly involved in efforts to prevent victims of Harvey Weinstein from speaking publicly, as well as investigations into Obama administration officials who were involved in negotiations with Iran. Whitehouse asks about connection to Palantir. Wylie says Palantir staff were involved but in a private capacity. Whitehouse: Has SCL worked with Black Cube? Wylie: There wasn’t a contract with Black Cube, but says there were dealings with former Israeli security services. Next up is Sheldon Whitehouse, Democratic senator from Rhode Island. Whitehouse is asking about Aggregate IQ and Ripon, the software they created. Wylie describes AIQ as a “franchise” of SCL, though the Canadian firm has contested claims that it is closely related to SCL. Lee: Is the use of social media to market different than what we’ve seen in the past? Hersh: Just because a campaign spends a lot of money on a kind of ad, doesn’t mean it works. Robocalls don’t work but people still use it. Probably nobody in this room changed their mind because of any ad that was run in the 2016 election. Given that there’s been whistleblowing, there has been no evidence provided of the advertisements actually working. In a presidential election with so much going on, the effect of any one ad is usually zero. Lee asks about Kogan’s connection to the Russian team researching the “dark triad” of personality traits. Wylie said that he learned of this directly from Kogan, and then through the Guardian and Observer’s reporting. Lee: How did you learn about CA’s black ops? Wylie: Alexander Nix told me? Lee: Who was involved in them? Wylie: My understanding was that in various projects, misappropriated information was used as kompromat against opposition candidates. Michael Lee, Republican senator from Utah: You took that same data with you upon leaving the company. Wylie: Most people were contractors or had companies. I received a copy of that data. Lee: After leaving the company you had a series of meetings with a major campaign to discuss micro-targeting. Wylie: That’s not true. Lee: You were going to use that data for something. Wylie: The data was never used on any commercial project. I didn’t take any data from Cambridge Analytica. Lee: You didn’t take it because it was already with you? Wylie: Yes. After I left CA, I continued working on independent projects, but I didn’t use that data on any commercial contract. Lee: Couldn’t that data have proven useful to you? Wylie: I could have, but I didn’t use it. Leahy: How does traditional online marketing compare to what CA did? Wylie: Traditional marketing doesn’t misappropriate tens of millions of people’s data, and it is not or should not be targeted at people’s mental state like neuroticism and paranoia, or racial biases. Leahy: Why did the investors think this would work? Wylie: Steve Bannon believes that politics is downstream from culture. They were seeking out companies to build an arsenal of weapons to fight a culture war. Senator Patrick Leahy is up next. He brings up reports that CA was testing messages like “drain the swamp”, “build the wall”, and “deep state” in 2014, before the Trump campaign ever existed. Leahy: What did the company learn from these tests? Wylie: The company learned that there were segments of the populace that were responsive to these messages that weren’t necessarily reflected in other polling. Leahy: Our laws prohibit non-Americans from working on US campaigns. Did CA follow this law? Wylie: To my understanding, the legal advice memo on this issue was ignored. Many of the people who were sent to the US to work on campaigns were not privy to the memo and may not have known that they were violating US law. Kennedy asks if any of the other CA data was obtained legally. Wylie: The consumer data lists were acquired through contracts? Kennedy: Did CA hack anyone while you were there? Wylie: I have seen documents that refer to special operations. Kennedy: Did CA get info from Wikileaks? Wylie: Not while he was there. Kennedy: List all of CA’s clients while you were there. Wylie: There were PACs and various candidates. A network of PACs that were primarily financed by Robert Mercer, and then several senatorial and congressional campaigns, some issue campaigns, John Bolton’s PAC. Kennedy: Did it work for Russia while you were there. Wylie: We did not have a Russian client while I was there. Kennedy asks for all the sources of data beyond Facebook. Wylie: Experian, Acxiom, voter rolls. Smaller firms with niche data. Experiments on collecting other social media data like Twitter. Kennedy: “Put Facebook aside for a moment. The justice department and FBI will get to the bottom of that.” Senator John Kennedy: Professor Hersh, if what you’re saying is that the American people aren’t persuadable by advertising, I think that’s rubbish. I see kids walking around saying “dilly dilly” and they didn’t get that from nowhere. Feinstein asks if the Facebook data set could have ended up in Russia. Wylie brings up the connections between Aleksandr Kogan and St Petersburg university. It’s worth noting that Kogan has denied any insinuation that his work with Russian academics. Wylie: “The only foreign leader that was tested when I was there was Vladimir Putin.” The bulk of the message testing was about Russian expansion. Wylie says he can’t say there was any connection to IRA, but that there was “a lot of noise”. Feinstein: Starts with question about “information warfare” campaign by the IRA. What can you tell us about connections between SCL/CA and IRA/Russia? Wylie: One of my concerns was the level of engagement the company had with Lukoil. CA made presentations and sent documents to Lukoil that made reference to its experience. Alexander Nix emailed me to say that he gave a white paper to the CEO of Lukoil. Research Alex Kogan was also working with a Russian university. Grassley: If CA had kept the Facebook data and used it during the Trump campaign, what impact would that have on influencing the election. Hersh: It is hard to move people. It’s easier to mobilize or demobilize than it is to persuade people. There hasn’t been any data released from Facebook to help us know what the answer is. If this had actually been effective, Facebook and CA would know from the data analytics. Repeats his skepticism of the efficacy. Grassley just established that Wylie did not work for CA while it was working for Trump, which he acknowledged was true. We’re moving on to questioning. Everyone gets 5 minutes, but I’m not sure if that’s 5 minutes per witness, or total. Grassley goes first. Jamison: New regulations are likely to harm FB users. They would likely serve to protect FB from new competition. Jamison says that Europe’s new GDPR regulations are stifling competition and driving small firms out of Europe. Jamison: Each of Facebook’s steps over the years probably made sense at the time, but taken as a whole, there’s a broader problem. Jamison: Facebook has pivoted from being a connector of communities to someone that investigates people’s lives and filters their messages. Now for Jamison who sums up his testimony with three points: Using Facebook and other social media data in ways that are not transparent to users is not unusual. Facebook has allowed itself to drift from serving users to serving advertisers, which is not a regulatory problem. New regulations are more likely to benefit Facebook than to rein it in. Wylie: My Facebook ban reveals the unchecked power of technology companies, when they can delete my entire digital presence because I spoke out. “Social platforms are no longer safe for users.” Wylie: The work of CA is not comparable to other political marketers, because it used rumor, misinformation, and kompromat. Wylie: I have seen documents where the firm sought to obtain hacked materials. Some of the subjects were heads of state... Wylie: Data is being used to algorithmically segregate us. Cambridge Analytica is the canary in the coal mine. Hersh is casting doubt on whether Cambridge Analytica’s psychographic targeting claims. He says campaigns that attempt to predict race of voters are wrong 25% of the time. If campaigns get race wrong a quarter of the time, how can we expect them to predict psychographic traits like neuroticism? Hersh: “Every election brings exaggerated claims about the technological feats of campaigns.” Hersh points out that this occurs both because new technology is an easy story for the media, and because political consulting firms need to market their wares. Grassley is now swearing in the witnesses. We’re going to start with Eitan Hersh. The contrast between Grassley and Feinstein’s perspectives on this hearing is stark. Grassley basically said, everyone uses data and microtargeting, but sure, let’s talk about it in general. Feinstein is asking questions about the shadiest aspects of CA’s activities, digging into possible connections to Russia, WikiLeaks, and hackers. Feinstein: We do not know the extent to which CA worked with hackers to obtain damaging information on opponents... We do not know the extent of CA’s contact with Julian Assange... Next up is Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee. While Grassley was going big picture, Feinstein is digging into the details of Cambridge Analytica’s dealings, giving a description of Project Ripon – the campaigning interface the company built – and how they used psychographic profiles to segment voters and craft messages. Grassley is bringing up other uses of microtargeting and Facebook data, such as the Obama campaign’s use of a Facebook app in 2012. Grassley: The underlying facts of what happened with CA and the Facebook data haven’t changed much since December 2015, when the Guardian first reported on the data’s use by the Ted Cruz campaign. What’s changed is that CA went to work for Trump, and Trump won. And we’re off, with an opening statement by Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman. Grassley says that he requested Cambridge Analytica to appear at this hearing, but they declined in light of their recent declaration of insolvency. Eitan Hersh, the political scientist and expert on microtargeting who is also testifying at today’s hearing, just released his written testimony. The testimony is eight pages long, but here’s the introduction (emphasis mine): First, I will describe voter targeting practices. Based on the information I have seen from public reports about Cambridge Analytica, it is my opinion that its targeting practices in 2016 ought not to be a major cause for concern in terms of unduly influencing the election outcome. Second, I will explain the gaps in our knowledge about the effects of social media-based targeting. Much more could be learned by impartial researchers to determine the power of targeting tools used in the 2016 election and, more importantly, the landscape of targeting in the coming years. In order for researchers to learn these things, they will need access to data held by Facebook. Third, I will suggest that those interested in the effect of social media platforms on electoral politics should focus not only on the supply of provocative political information from campaigns and firms like Cambridge Analytica, but also on the demand for provocative information from American citizens. Senators are filing into the hearing, and the witnesses are seated, so we should be getting started soon. Last night, the New York Times reported that the department of justice and FBI have begun investigating the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica. According to the Times, investigators have been questioning former CA employees, as well as its banks. Wylie confirmed to the Times that he had been contacted by both the FBI and the DOJ, and was planning to meet with their investigators. The political consultancy is also facing investigations in the UK. Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Christopher Wylie’s appearance before the Senate judiciary committee. Wylie is the pink-haired Canadian data scientist whose decision to blow the whistle on the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica set off shock waves that are still reverberating through Westminster, Washington DC, and Silicon Valley. Since Wylie went public with the story of how the personal information of tens of millions of people was harvested from Facebook and used by a political consultant for Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica has collapsed and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress for the first time. Wylie appeared before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee of Parliament in late March, and he met privately with House Democrats in April. Today’s hearing, titled “Cambridge Analytica and the Future of Data Privacy”, will be his first public appearance before US lawmakers. Also testifying are Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science and author of Hacking the Electorate, and Mark Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and director of the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center. Jamison has written about the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal from a business perspective, noting that while the use of data for political campaigns is normal, Facebook was wrong not to be more transparent with its users: For markets to perform well, customers should be given complete and understandable information on the nature of the services they are buying, even those that have a zero monetary price as in the case of Facebook. This isn’t happening. Hersh, whose book studies the use and efficacy of micro-targeting by political campaigns, has called Cambridge Analytica’s claims about psychographic profiling “snake oil”. “To me, the story is 99% about Facebook and 1% about Cambridge Analytica,” Hersh told the LA Times."

          "headline": "Facial recognition is not just useless. In police hands, it is dangerous",
          "bodyText": "Science fiction is often a precursor to science fact. Some of the best dystopian novels and films are set in a nightmarish world where the state can follow you everywhere you go, as your face flashes up a match on a population-level database. Now facial recognition is here for real. The police are scanning thousands of our faces – at protests, football matches, music festivals and even Remembrance Day commemorations – and comparing them against secret databases. The only difference is that in the books and the films it always worked. Yesterday, Big Brother Watch published the results of its investigation into police use of facial recognition software. It revealed that the Met’s technology is 98% inaccurate. This hasn’t come as a big surprise to us at Liberty. When we were invited to witness the Met’s trial of the technology at Notting Hill carnival last summer, we saw a young woman being matched with a balding man on the police database. Across the Atlantic, the FBI’s facial recognition algorithm regularly misidentifies women and people of colour. This technology heralds a grave risk of injustice by misidentification, and puts each and every one of us in a perpetual police lineup. Facial recognition exists in a regulatory vacuum. It doesn’t come under the same regulatory framework as camera surveillance and other biometric data such as fingerprints and DNA. Parliament hasn’t ever debated it. And automated facial recognition technology isn’t passive, like CCTV. It loads surveillance cameras with biometric software to create maps of people’s unique facial characteristics in real time. These are then measured and matched to images stored elsewhere. Although it is talked up as being needed to keep us safe from crime, the database against which thousands of people’s faces were compared at Remembrance Day commemorations at the Cenotaph last November was compiled of people who had shown obsessive behaviour towards particular public figures – none of whom were wanted for arrest, and all of whom were engaging in lawful behaviour. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what can happen when invasive technology exists with no law governing it and no oversight of its use. It’s policing without constraint, not policing by consent. The police say Tony Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner, is tasked with keeping an eye on them – but he’s not. In fact, the commissioner has just said that Home Office delays in setting out a strategy for facial recognition have left the police to their own devices. With no legislation, guidance, policy or oversight, facial recognition technology should have no place on our streets. It has chilling implications for our freedom. Every single person who walks by these cameras will have their face – their most identifiable feature – scanned and stored on a police database. There is no escaping it – especially when you don’t know it’s happening. And if you are one of the unlucky ones who is falsely identified as a match, you might be forced to prove your identity to the police – or be arrested for a crime you didn’t commit. It’s not hard to imagine the chilling effect its unrestricted use will have. Constant surveillance leads to people self-censoring lawful behaviour. Stealthily, these measures curb our right to protest, speak freely and dissent. They shape our behaviours in ways that corrode the heart of our democratic freedoms. And even more perniciously, this technology is most dangerous for the people who need it the most. Technology that misidentifies women and people from ethnic minority communities disenfranchises people who already face inequality. If the history of the civil rights movement teaches us anything, it’s that protest can bring about social change. The people most likely to be wronged by the facial recognition technology being rolled out in our public spaces are the people who need public protest the most. The government’s defence is that the technology is “evolving”. But that doesn’t wash when it is having a real and unjust impact on people in the here and now. There is an increasing pattern of British police “trialling” new tools and tech – such as fingerprint scanning and spit hoods – that suddenly become the norm without so much as a robust assessment of the trial or a public debate. This must stop now. On Monday the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said that if the Home Office and the police forces do not address her concerns about the use of facial recognition technology, she will consider taking legal action to ensure the public is protected. Liberty will be right behind her. • Martha Spurrier is a British barrister and human rights campaigner and the director of Liberty"

          "bodyText": "Twitter is announcing a global change to its ranking algorithm this week, its first step toward improving the “health” of online conversations since it launched a renewed effort to address rampant trolling, harassment and abuse in March. “It’s shaping up to be one of the highest-impact things that we’ve done,” the chief executive, Jack Dorsey ,said of the update, which will change how tweets appear in search results or conversations. “The spirit of the thing is that we want to take the burden off the person receiving abuse or mob-like behavior.” Social media platforms have long struggled to police acceptable content and behavior on their sites, but external pressure on the companies increased significantly following the revelation that a Russian influence operation used the platforms in coordinated campaigns around the 2016 US election. Facebook and Google have largely responded by promising to hire thousands of moderators and improve their artificial intelligence tools to automate content removal. Twitter’s approach, which it outlined to reporters in a briefing on Monday, is distinct because it is content neutral and will not require more human moderators. “A lot of our past action has been content based, and we are shifting more and more to conduct,” Dorsey said. Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice-president of trust and safety, said that the new changes were based on research that found that most of the abuse reports on Twitter originate in search results or the conversations that take place in the responses to a single tweet. The company also found that less than 1% of Twitter accounts made up the majority of abuse reports and that many of the reported tweets did not actually violate the company’s rules, despite “detract[ing] from the overall experience” for most users. The new system will use behavioral signals to assess whether a Twitter account is adding to – or detracting from – the tenor of conversations. For example, if an account tweets at multiple other users with the same message, and all of those accounts either block or mute the sender, Twitter will recognize that the account’s behavior is bothersome. But if an account tweets at multiple other accounts with the same message, and some of them reply or hit the “heart” button, Twitter will assess the interactions as welcome. Other signals will include whether an account has confirmed an email address or whether an account appears to be acting in a coordinated attack. With these new signals, Harvey explained, “it didn’t matter what was said; it mattered how people reacted.” The updated algorithm will result in certain tweets being pushed further down in a list of search results or replies, but will not delete them from the platform. Early experiments have resulted in a 4% decline in abuse reports from search and an 8% drop in abuse reports in conversations, said David Gasca, Twitter’s director of product management for health. This is not the first time that Twitter has promised to crack down on abuse and trolling on its platform. In 2015, then CEO Dick Costolo acknowledged that the company “sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls”. But complaints have continued under Dorsey’s leadership, and in March, the company decided to seek outside help, issuing a request for proposals for academics and NGOs to help it come up with ways to measure and promote healthy conversations. Dorsey and Harvey appeared optimistic that this new approach will have a significant impact on users’ experience. “We are trying to strike a balance,” Harvey said. “What would Twitter be without controversy?”"

          "headline": "Employers are monitoring computers, toilet breaks – even emotions. Is your boss watching you?",
          "bodyText": "Last year an American company microchipped dozens of its workers. In a “chip party” that made headlines around the world, employees lined up to have a device the size of a grain of rice implanted under the skin between their thumb and forefinger. At first, Todd Westby, the CEO of Three Square Market, thought only about five or six people – him and a couple of directors, some of the people who worked in the IT department – would volunteer. But of the 90 people who work at the headquarters, 72 are now chipped; Westby has a chip in each hand. They can be used to open security doors, log on to computers and make payments at the company’s vending machines. Can he see it taking off at lots of other companies? “Not necessarily,” he says. Or at least not yet. It’s partly a generational thing, he believes. “You may never want to be chipped but if you’re a millennial, you have no problems. They think it’s cool.” There are other uses for it – two months ago, the company (whose core business is selling vending machines and kiosks) started chipping people with dementia in Puerto Rico. If someone wanders off and gets lost, police can scan the chip “and they will know all their medical information, what drugs they can and can’t have, they’ll know their identity.” So far, Three Square Market has chipped 100 people, but plans to do 10,000. The company has just launched a mobile phone app that pairs the chip with the phone’s GPS, enabling the implantee’s location to be tracked. Last week, it started using it with people released from prison on probation, as a replacement for ankle tags, which Westby describes as “intimidating and degrading”. Could he ever see the company using GPS to track its chipped employees? “No,” he says. “There’s no reason to.” Not all firms would agree. Tech companies are coming up with ever more bizarre and intrusive ways to monitor workforces. Last week the Times reported that some Chinese companies are using sensors in helmets and hats to scan workers’ brainwaves and detect fatigue, stress and even emotions such as anger. It added that one electrical company uses brainwave scans to decide how many breaks workers get, and for how long. The technology is used on high-speed train drivers to “detect fatigue and attention loss”. While this sort of technology may have legitimate safety applications – a similar project was carried out with Crossrail workers using wristbands that sensed fatigue – it’s not hard to see how it could creep into other areas. In February, it was reported that Amazon had been granted patents for a wristband that not only tracked workers’ locations in the warehouse as they “picked” items to be dispatched, but could “read” their hand movements, buzzing or emitting a pulse to alert them when they were reaching for the wrong item. In the filing, Amazon describes it as being able to “monitor performance of the placing of the incoming inventory item into the identified storage location by the inventory system worker”. There are tech companies selling products that can take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor keystrokes and web usage, and even photograph them at their desks using their computers’ webcams. Working from home offers no protection, as all this can be done remotely. Software can monitor social media usage, analyse language or be installed on employees’ phones to monitor encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Employees can be fitted with badges that not only track their location, but also monitor their tone of voice, how often they speak in meetings and who they speak to and for how long. Employees have always been watched at work, and technology has always been used to do it. But where it was once a factory foreman with a stopwatch, or workers having to physically clock in and out, now “all of that physical stuff has gone into digital technology”, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “It captures things that you weren’t able to capture in the past, like how many keystrokes are people taking, what are they looking at on their screen while they’re at work, what kind of language are they using. And surveillance follows you outside the workplace now.” How much of this is legal? In the UK, employers are allowed to monitor which websites you look at while at work, says Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law Solicitors who specialises in employment law. “However, the device they monitor must be partly or wholly provided by work. Employers must also give prior warning if they are going to monitor your online activity, and should make you aware of the relevant social media policy.” It is also legal to monitor keystrokes, though again employees must be told they will be watched. “In companies where this system is in place, it is not uncommon for employers to speak to employees if they feel that their number of keystrokes is low,” says Landau. “It is worth noting that a high number of keystrokes does not necessarily mean high levels of productivity and vice versa.” Employers could theoretically use your computer’s webcam to see when you’re at your desk but “there should be a justification for such monitoring, and you should be informed of it beforehand. You should also be informed what the pictures will be used for, and how they will be stored.” As for GPS tracking, “a company may track any vehicles that they supply to their staff. However, the data they collect must only be used for the management purposes of the company. Any GPS device is not allowed to be turned on if the employee is using the vehicle for personal reasons outside of work.” James Bloodworth spent a month working as a “picker” – the person who locates the products ordered – for Amazon in March 2016 for his book Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain. “We carried this handheld device at all times and it tracks your productivity,” he says. It would direct workers to the items they need to find on the shelves in one of Amazon’s vast warehouses. “Each time you picked up an item, there would be this countdown timer [to get to the next item] which would measure your productivity.” Bloodworth says supervisors would tell people how productive they were being; he was warned he was in the bottom 10%. “You were also sent admonishments through the device saying you need to get your productivity up. You’re constantly tracked and rated. I found you couldn’t keep up with the productivity targets without running – yet you were also told you weren’t allowed to run, and if you did, you’d get a disciplinary. But if you fell behind in productivity, you’d get a disciplinary for that as well.” It didn’t feel, he says, “that you were really treated as a human being”. Workers had to go through airport-style security scanners at the beginning and end of their shifts, or to get to the break areas. He says going to the loo was described as “idle time” and once found a bottle of urine on one of the shelves. Amazon says its scanning devices “are common across the warehouse and logistics sector as well as in supermarkets, department stores and other businesses, and are designed to assist our people in performing their roles”, while the company “ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities, which are just a short walk from where they are working”. It adds: “Associates are allowed to use the toilet whenever needed. We do not monitor toilet breaks.” Some of Bloodworth’s colleagues, he says, were angry about the level of monitoring – “but it was more cynicism and resignation. Most of the people I met hadn’t been in the job very long or were looking for other jobs. Every job was temporary and it was a workforce completely in flux.” Has Bloodworth seen the future? Will we all be monitored like this by our bosses in years to come? Possibly, he says. “One of the things that has arisen in response to the book is that people say work is going to be automated anyway, or workers need to be more flexible, as if this is the way of the future and it’s inevitable, which I think is quite dangerous. Amazon can get away with this because of political choices and because the trade union movement is quite weak. I think other businesses will look at Amazon, see they have had success with this business model – and seek to replicate it.” For his book Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock, a sociologist of work at the Oxford Internet Institute, spent six months working in a call centre. You get a sense of the monitoring, he says, “from the moment you walk in. You have TV screens that have everyone’s relative performance to each other displayed. Managers collect data on almost every single part of what you do. Every single phone call I ever made was digitally recorded and stored. In terms of monitoring, it’s like being able to call back every single thing somebody has made on an assembly line and retrospectively judge it for quality. We all make mistakes and we all have bad days, but this kind of monitoring can be made retrospectively to sack people and is used to give people a sense that they could lose their jobs at any moment.” Monitoring is built into many of the jobs that form the so-called “gig economy”. It’s not easy to object to the constant surveillance when you’re desperate for work. What has surprised Spicer is how willingly people in better-paid jobs have taken to it. “Prisoners in the past were forced to wear tracking bands but now we willingly put on step trackers or other kinds of tracking devices given to us by our employers, and in some cases we pay for the privilege.” Companies such as IBM, BP, Bank of America, Target and Barclays have offered their employees Fitbit activity trackers. It is part, Spicer says, of “this whole idea of wanting to improve or optimise yourself. A lot of technology is designed to not just feed back data about your performance to your boss, but also give it to you. I guess they’re also seen as cool or fashionable, so it’s not surprising they’re taken up so readily.” Spicer has watched the shift away from “monitoring something like emails to monitoring people’s bodies – the rise of bio-tracking basically. The monitoring of your vital signs, emotions, moods.” Of Three Square Market’s practice of chipping employees, he says: “You can imagine that slowly extending. You could imagine things like employers asking to have your DNA in the future, and other kinds of data.” Surveillance can have positive applications. It’s necessary (and legally required) in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. It could be used to prevent harassment and bullying, and to root out bias and discrimination. One interesting study last year monitored emails and productivity, and used sensors to track behaviour and interaction with management, and found that men and women behaved almost identically at work. The findings challenged the belief that the reason women are not promoted to senior levels is that they are less proactive or have fewer interactions with leaders, and simply need to “lean in”. Still, says, Woodcock, “we need to have a conversation in society about whether work should be somewhere that you’re surveilled”. That need is perhaps most urgent where low-paid, insecure jobs are concerned. “If you work in the gig economy, you have a smartphone,” Woodcock points out, and that smartphone can be used to track you. “I think because many of these workplaces don’t have traditional forms of organisation or trade unions, management are able to introduce these things with relatively little collective resistance.” The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is well aware of the issues of monitoring and data collection. James Farrar is the chair of its United Private Hire Drivers branch, and the Uber driver who won a legal battle against the company last year for drivers’ rights. “They do collect an awful lot of information,” he says. “One of the things they will report to you on a daily basis is how good your acceleration and braking has been. You get a rating. The question is: why are they collecting that information?” Uber also monitors “unusual movements” of the phone when someone is driving (implying it knows if someone is using their phone while at the wheel) and, of course, tracks cars and drivers by GPS. “My concern with it is this information is being fed into a dispatch algorithm,” he says. “We should have access to the data and understand how it’s being used. If some kind of quality score on my driving capability [is put into an algorithm], I may be offered less valuable work, kept away from the most valuable clients – who knows?” It’s not an unreasonable fear – the food delivery company Deliveroo already does something similar, monitoring its riders’ and drivers’ performance, and has started offering “priority access” when booking shifts to those who “provide the most consistent, quality service”. Uber, however, says its monitoring is intended only to deliver “a smoother, safer ride … This data is used to inform drivers of their driving habits and is not used to affect future trip requests.” Not all surveillance is bad, says Farrar. In some ways, he would like more. He was assaulted by a passenger and is calling for CCTV in all vehicles, partly for the safety of drivers. “There is a role for surveillance technology,” he says. Ironically, when Farrar went for a meeting with Uber to discuss the assault, the company made him turn his phone off to prove he wasn’t recording it."

          "bodyText": "One peculiar side-effect of the Trump era on popular culture is that old tales that might have felt speculative in another time are being made new again, lent fresh urgency and vigour by current events. “It could happen here”, has been the resounding – and by now somewhat cliched response – to Hulu’s incel-evoking adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, whose success must have had executives rifling through the Penguin Modern Classics section for ripe dystopian IP. Quite whether anyone’s first choice though would have been Ray Bradbury’s 1953 book Fahrenheit 451 is debatable. While it may have some pertinent truths to tell about anti-intellectualism and the stultifying effect of mass media on individual though, its setting – an authoritarian state where books are illegal – feels rather less compelling in an age when information can be widely disseminated at the swipe of a thumb. Iranian-director Rahim Bahrani (99 Homes, Chop Shop) finds a solution of sorts to this issue with an uneven HBO TV movie adaptation of Bradbury’s book, which stars Michael B Jordan and premiered at the Cannes film festival. It’s a film that drags the source material into a gleaming Black Mirror-tinged future where where, not just books but all forms of writing and indeed art have been outlawed, and mass communication instead takes place through a series of emoji-like images sent around the Nine, a heavily censored, state propaganda-spewing update of the internet. Books still have a totemic presence, and mass burnings of them are livestreamed onto the Nine to dissuade would-be bibliophiles and entertain everyone else, but they are treated as illicit, dust-coated objects from a darker time. (Early in the film a group of schoolchildren gawp and shudder as one is displayed in their classroom, a scene that doesn’t seem too much of a stretch to imagine happening in a class full of smartphone-native kids in a time not far from now.) The people doing the burning are nominally known as the firemen, though they’re closer to a fascistic, heavily militarised police force, led by the sadistic captain Beatty (depicted with characteristic menace by Michael Shannon). Jordan meanwhile plays Guy Montag, a young fireman who is being fast-tracked for promotion due to his willingness to do what needs to be done, a willingness that is helped along by memory depleting sedatives administered every day in the form of eye drops. Secretly though, Montag is beginning to question the mission, and his doubts are accelerated after he witnesses a woman burn herself alive rather than be parted from her novels. He smuggles her copy of Notes From the Underground home and thus begins a process of enlightenment, helped along the way by resistance fighter Clarisse (Sofia Boutella). Jordan, who exec-produced the film as well as starring in it, is gaining a reputation for portraying this sort of roiling, conflicted figure, though his performance here doesn’t match his turn as Killmonger in Black Panther in its rawness and complexity. Bahrani’s film seeks to draw some neat parallels with the present. The demise of books, we learn, was ended not by diktat but by the will of the public, who instead of reading “were just glancing at headlines generated by an algorithm.” There’s a sense too that the firemen’s form censorship might be the logical endpoint of a social media culture that refuses to expose itself to dissenting thought. Visually too the film pops and dazzles, the soft futurist blues and pinks reminiscent of Blade Runner 2049 giving way to the violent yellows and blacks once the conflagrations start in earnest. And there are some creepy technological touches, like the Siri-like devices that offer up alternative facts and spy on its users. At the same time there’s a high-minded, hectoring tone throughout that soon begins to grate, with only the slightly pantomime figure of Shannon breaking up the film’s portentous tone. For all its mentions of Proust, Dostoevsky and Kafka, the film never really grapples with the knotty ideas behind the works it namedrops. We never get a sense of what in these books has intellectually stirred Montag from his stupor. Ultimately though, the main issue with this Fahrenheit 451 may not be the fault of its director but with the source material. No film adaption could match the potency and thrill of reading a book about a world where books are banned. It’s a monument to the power of literature that even the firemen would struggle to burn down."

          "bodyText": "We live in a climate of austerity. In the past few months alone, we have seen a federal budget that proposes rolling back support for low-income housing, an executive order attacking welfare programs, and a plan to create a nationwide electronic registry of poor and working-class people. In the context of shrinking support, which families are able to access their basic human needs – housing, food, and healthcare – and which are not? Increasingly it is algorithms – not humans – making that call. Since 2010, I’ve crossed the country studying and writing about the impact of hi-tech tools on public service programs. In Indiana, I investigated an attempt to automate and privatize the state’s welfare eligibility processes. In Los Angeles county, I explored the coordinated entry system, a digital tool intended to match the most vulnerable unhoused people with the most appropriate available resources. And in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, I studied a statistical model that is supposed to be able to predict which children might be victims of abuse or neglect in the future. In each place I visited, policymakers, data scientists, and social workers told a remarkably consistent story: there is extraordinary need for public programs and not enough help to go around. The goal of automated decision-making, they told me, is to distribute limited resources more equitably, but also to help make the heartbreaking choices of whom among the most exploited and marginalized people in the United States will get help. “We have extraordinary need [for housing] and can’t meet all of that need at once,” said Molly Rysman, the housing and homelessness deputy for Los Angeles county’s District 3, speaking in 2015 about coordinated entry. “So you’ve got to figure out: how do we get folks who are going to bleed to death access to a doctor, and folks who have the flu to wait? It’s unfortunate to have to do that, but it is the reality of what we’re stuck with.” The result has been an explosion of digital tools for managing poverty – and for alleviating the uncomfortable feeling that we’re not doing enough to address economic suffering. Automated eligibility systems remove discretion from frontline caseworkers and replace welfare offices with online forms and privatized call centers. What seems like an effort to lower program barriers and remove human bias often has the opposite effect, blocking hundreds of thousands of people from receiving the services they deserve. In Indiana, for example, Omega Young of Evansville lost her Medicaid coverage when she failed to attend a telephone recertification appointment. She missed the call because she was in the hospital suffering from terminal cancer. Algorithms act as moral thermometers, sifting survey data to rank unhoused people based on their perceived vulnerability. In the best-case scenario, this ensures that those most in need receive help more quickly. But because low-income housing is scarce, creating a spectrum of “deservingness” often means prioritizing those whose services are most cost-effective. Predictive models use statistics to predict which parents might maltreat their children. But the data that serves as their foundation is only collected on families that use public programs, leading to hi-tech risk detection systems that confuse parenting while poor with poor parenting. In Pittsburgh, the new Allegheny Family Screening Tool weighs 131 different variables available in the department of human services’ public service data warehouse – including whether a family receives Snap, support for depression, or county medical assistance – to decide which calls to the county’s abuse and neglect hotline should be screened in for child welfare investigation. In other words, we are increasingly turning to digital tools to rank and rate which struggling families most deserve support. The trouble with this practice of hi-tech triage is that it treats social problems as if they are natural disasters – random, temporary, inevitable occurrences – obscuring the political choices that produce them. Take the housing crisis I witnessed firsthand during my reporting in Skid Row and South Los Angeles. There are 58,000 unhoused people in Los Angeles county alone, more than the figure for the countries of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland combined. The unhoused population of Los Angeles county has risen every year since 2014; last year, it increased 23%. The housing crisis in Los Angeles was not – and is not – random, temporary or inevitable. In the 1950s, opponents blocked a plan to build 10,000 units of integrated low-income housing by reporting the housing authority to the House un-American activities committee. The attempt to shelter poor and working families was lambasted as an act of communism. In the 1960s, the city’s master plan demolished “blighted” neighborhoods without building replacement housing. Homelessness is the product of austere policy. It is caused by inadequate supply of affordable housing, combined with stagnating incomes and a miserly public service system, which devotes far too many resources to diverting those in need from the assistance they are legally entitled to. The good news about our collective responsibility for America’s housing crisis is this: if we created this catastrophe, we can fix it. Two simple, but politically challenging, remedies could go a long way towards stemming the growing tide of housing insecurity. First, those of us who own homes could agree to forgo our mortgage interest tax deduction. Sociologist Matthew Desmond points out that as a nation we spent about $41bn in 2016 on housing supports for the needy. Yet we spent more than four times as much – $171bn – on homeowner tax subsidies that primarily benefit families making more than $100,000 a year. Pledging that money instead to creating and stabilizing low-income housing could solve homelessness in a single year. Second, we could lower barriers to receiving social services and increase the payments for TANF, Snap, EITC and other means-tested benefits. Stagnating public benefits levels leave few options when a family faces a health emergency, housing crisis or work interruption. In Los Angeles, general relief payments have been stuck at $221 a month since 1982. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that 13,000 people on public assistance fall into homelessness in the county every month, simply because their benefit levels are not keeping up with the cost of living. In the absence of political will to tackle America’s growing economic crisis, hi-tech tools can only serve to automate and amplify existing inequalities. Yet we are doubling down on austerity instead of facing the root causes of extreme poverty head-on. Austerity fever requires a dedication to cutting the fat from already starving programs. Its systems engineering approaches replace our full panoply of social values – dignity, self-determination, equity, due process – with the twin imperatives of efficiency and cost savings. The triage narrative absolves us of responsibility for our country’s unnatural disasters: the tragedies of malnutrition, homelessness, preventable death and family dissolution, by reinforcing the myth that extreme poverty is simply a fact of life – something to be managed rather than eradicated. As the politics of austerity expands, automated decision-making systems act as empathy overrides, outsourcing inhuman choices about who survives and thrives, and who doesn’t. We empower machines to make these decisions because they are too difficult for us, because we know better. We know that there is no ethical way to prioritize one life over the next.

For clarity, let’s say that Instagram is one person kissing themself in a bar mirror and LinkedIn is a businessman touching himself in a pub toilet. Gotcha. Anyway, Klout was a slightly different social media tool, in that it analysed your Twitter and Facebook accounts for followers, retweets, shares and mentions and then awarded you a “Klout score” – a number between one and 100 – that reflected how influential you were. OK, great. I have one question. Would that question be, by any chance: “Why?” It would! Well, that is harder to say. It may be because, in this hard-thrusting digital age, a good Klout score could give you the edge in the recruitment field. Or it may be because people are very needy. Either way, it doesn’t matter. Klout is closing shop. Oh no! Why? The long answer is that it was acquired by a company called Lithium Technologies, which plans to harvest the tool’s artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities for use in its other products. Also, it may have something to do with the implementation of GDPR. Is there a short answer? Sure: because it was stupid. Klout took the entire spectrum of human interaction and condensed it to a two-digit number that you could use to bludgeon anyone who failed to adhere to its scoring algorithm. It was tacky and basic and cheap. Did you have a Klout score? I did. What was it? A measly 62, even though it said I was an expert in subjects such as journalism, publishing and – oh – Made in Chelsea. What does it mean now that Klout has died? It means we have entered a more sophisticated age of interaction. We have come to realise that the infinite richness of the human condition does not easily lend itself to the kind of cold, hard, robotic quantification that Klout offered. Make no mistake, this is a beat of the drum. A loud, organic beat that says: “We are still here and we are more beautifully complicated than you could ever know.” Really? Well, it also means that Lithium Technologies is planning to bring out “a new social-impact scoring methodology based on Twitter” very shortly. Do say: “Klout is klosed.” Don’t say: “No wonder you are happy. You are such a 46.”"

          "headline": "UK accused of flouting human rights in 'racialised' war on gangs",
          "bodyText": "The Conservative government triggered a “racialised” war on gangs that has stigmatised black youngsters and left Britain breaking its human rights obligations, Amnesty International has said. In a report about a police list of gang suspects, called the gangs violence matrix, the human rights group alleged the list violated the human rights of the predominantly black youngsters on it. The gang violence matrix is used by the Metropolitan police to identify gang members, and the force says it helps to thwart violence. Police in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands are understood to use similar lists. But Amnesty claimed the tactic missed the underlying causes of the rising violence on Britain’s streets. Amnesty said the gang matrix stemmed from the Conservative response to the 2011 riots across England. “In the immediate days after the riots, then prime minister David Cameron promised a ‘concerted, all-out war on gangs and gang culture’ and within six months both the Home Office and the mayor’s office had announced flagship new anti-gang strategies, including the launch of a reconfigured [Met police] Trident gang command in London,” the report said. The findings showed that of those on the matrix, 78% were black and 9% from other ethnic minorities. This compared with Met figures stating that 27% of those behind violence in London were black. In London, 3,806 people were on the matrix, with 5% in the red category, assessed as having the highest risk of committing violence, and 64% in the green, the lowest. Amnesty claimed the Met was putting people on the matrix in some cases because it mistook cultural preferences, such as the music people listened to, for criminality. It also claimed officers were using social media networks without a warrant to gather intelligence from those under suspicion. Kate Allen, Amnesty International’s UK director, said: “The entire system is racially discriminatory, stigmatising young black men for the type of music they listen to or their social media behaviour, and perpetuating racial bias with potential impacts in all sorts of areas of their lives. “Some police officers have been acting like they’re in the wild west, making the false assumptions that they can set up fake profiles and covertly befriend people online to monitor them without needing the appropriate search warrants. “The mayor of London needs to dismantle the matrix unless he can bring it in line with international human rights standards.” The Guardian first reported concerns the gangs matrix was overly targeting black youths in 2016, and on Monday reported that four out of 10 suspects were assessed as posing zero risk of committing violence, according to the police’s own assessments. Those assessments were carried out by a computer algorithm, the report said. Amnesty said the youngest person on the list was aged 12. A man called “Paul”, who applied for a job when he was 21 years old, said his criminal record check came back clean, but that he was still on the matrix. He said the only reason he could think of was an incident when he was aged 12. The information commissioner is already investigating the gang matrix for any data law breaches. Allen said Amnesty had stumbled on to the problems with the matrix during discussions with Met officers about the increasing role technology was playing in law enforcement. She said Met officers had alerted the human rights group by saying they themselves were concerned about the tactic. Being entered on the matrix can blight the lives of those on it, even if they are not convicted of a criminal offence. Amnesty said the Met shared information with others in the public sector: “Data sharing between the police and government agencies means that this stigmatising ‘red flag’ can follow people through their interaction with service providers, from housing to education, to job centres, raising important questions about how this may impact their rights. Our report flags particular areas of concern across immigration, housing, education and employment.” It concluded: “This report in many ways provides a case study of how a politicised ‘war against the gang’ has filtered down and become the crucial lens through which the Metropolitan police and other government services view and attempt to address serious interpersonal youth violence, gun and knife crime in London. “In reality, as the Met points out, being in a gang or gang video is not, in and of itself, a crime. In fact, many of the signifiers used to identify ‘gang members’ reflect elements of urban youth culture and identity that have nothing to do with serious offending. ”This conflation of certain elements of urban youth culture with violent offending is heavily racialised.” David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham in north London, said of the report: “Why are so many young black men and minors being arbitrarily criminalised in this way when they have not committed a violent or serious offence? “Why are young black men from the same neighbourhood automatically slapped with the gang label whereas the Bullingdon Club are not a gang?” Lammy added: “This has resulted in a policing tool that essentially involves the profiling of urban young black men as gang members and violent criminals, which in turn has a serious impact not just on the life chances of these men but also for trust in the police and relations between communities and the police in parts of London like Tottenham.” The Home Office referred questions about the matrix to the Met. The Met said: “The style of music that someone listens to has no bearing on whether someone is placed on the matrix. However, evidence that someone is glorifying gang violence in a music video posted on social media can be used as an intelligence source. “In relation to suggestions of potential racial disproportionality of the matrix, the MPS has actively engaged with David Lammy MP, Amnesty International and the information commissioner’s office to help understand the approach taken, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of all Londoners, and especially those most at risk from gang and other violent crimes.”"

          "headline": "Cambridge Analytica: how did it turn clicks into votes?",
          "bodyText": "How do 87m records scraped from Facebook become an advertising campaign that could help swing an election? What does gathering that much data actually involve? And what does that data tell us about ourselves? The Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised question after question, but for many, the technological USP of the company, which announced last week that it was closing its operations, remains a mystery. For those 87 million people probably wondering what was actually done with their data, I went back to Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee who blew the whistle on the company’s problematic operations in the Observer. According to Wylie, all you need to know is a little bit about data science, a little bit about bored rich women, and a little bit about human psychology... Step one, he says, over the phone as he scrambles to catch a train: “When you’re building an algorithm, you first need to create a training set.” That is: no matter what you want to use fancy data science to discover, you first need to gather the old-fashioned way. Before you can use Facebook likes to predict a person’s psychological profile, you need to get a few hundred thousand people to do a 120-question personality quiz. The “training set” refers, then, to that data in its entirety: the Facebook likes, the personality tests, and everything else you want to learn from. Most important, it needs to contain your “feature set”: “The underlying data that you want to make predictions on,” Wylie says. “In this case, it’s Facebook data, but it could be, for example, text, like natural language, or it could be clickstream data” – the complete record of your browsing activity on the web.“Those are all the features that you want to [use to] predict.” At the other end, you need your “target variables” – in Wylie’s words, “the things that you’re trying to predict for. So in this case, personality traits or political orientation, or what have you.” If you’re trying to use one thing to predict another, it helps if you can look at both at the same time. “If you want to know the relationships between Facebook likes in your feature set and personality traits as your target variables, you need to see both,” says Wylie. Facebook data, which lies at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story, is a fairly plentiful resource in the data science world – and certainly was back in 2014, when Wylie first started working in this area. Personality traits are much harder to get hold of: despite what the proliferation of BuzzFeed quizzes might suggest, it takes quite a lot to persuade someone to fill in a 120-question survey (the length of the short version of one of the standard psychological surveys, the Ipip-Neo). “Quite a lot” is relative, however. “For some people, the incentive to take a survey is financial. If you’re a student or looking for work or just want to make $5, that’s an incentive.” The actual money handed over, Wylie says, “ranged from $2 to $4”. The higher payments go to “groups that were harder to get”. The group least likely to take a survey, and so earning the most from it, were African American men. “Other people take surveys just because they find it interesting, or they are bored. So we over-sampled wealthy white women. Because if you live in the Hamptons and have nothing to do in the afternoon, you fill out consumer research surveys.” The personality surveys use those 120 questions to profile people along five discrete axes – the “five factors” model, popularly called the “Ocean” model after one common breakdown of the factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. That model clusters personality traits into distinctions that seem to hold across cultures and across time. So, for instance, those who describe themselves as “loud” are likely to also describe themselves as “gregarious”. If they agree with that description this year, they’re likely to agree with it next year. That cluster is likely to show up in responses in every language. And if a person responds to it negatively, there are likely to be real, noticeable differences between them and people who answer it positively. Those features of the model are what make it actually useful for profiling individuals, says Wylie – in contrast to some other popular psychological profiles such as the Myers-Briggs system. In the testing phase of the research, Facebook was barely involved. The surveys were offered on commercial data research sites – first Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, then a specialist operator called Qualtrics. (The switch was made, Wylie says, because Amazon has the issue that “people are overfamiliar with filling out surveys” – so much so that it starts to affect your results.) It was only at the very end that Facebook came into play. In order to be paid for their survey, users were required to log in to the site, and approve access to the survey app developed by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic whose research into personality profiling using Facebook likes provided the perfect access for the Robert Mercer-funded Cambridge Analytica to quickly get in on the field. (Kogan maintains that Cambridge Analytica assured him they were using data appropriately and says he has been “used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica”.) To a survey user, the process was quick: “You click the app, you go on, and then it gives you the payment code.” But two very important things happened in those few seconds. First, the app harvested as much data as it could about the user who just logged on. Where the psychological profile is the target variable, the Facebook data is the “feature set”: the information a data scientist has on everyone else, which they need to use in order to accurately predict the features they really want to know. It also provided personally identifiable information such as real name, location and contact details – something that wasn’t discoverable through the survey sites themselves. “That meant you could take the inventory and relate it to a natural person [who is] matchable to the electoral register.” Second, the app did the same thing for all the friends of the user who installed it. Suddenly the hundreds of thousands of people who you’ve paid a couple of dollars to fill out a survey, whose personalities are a mystery, become millions of people whose Facebook profiles are an open book. That’s where the final transformation comes in. How do you turn a few hundred thousand personality profiles into a few million? With a lot of computing power, and a massive matrix of possibilities. “Even though your sample size is 300,000 people, give or take, your feature set is like 100m across,” says Wylie. Every single Facebook “like” found in the data set becomes its own column in this enormous matrix. “Even if there is only one instance in the entire set, it’s still a feature.” “All that data was then put into an ensemble model,” Wylie says. “This is when you use different families or approaches of machine learning, because each of them will have their own strengths and weaknesses... and then they sort of vote, and then you amalgamate the results and come up with a conclusion.” This is where data science becomes more of a data art: the exact input of each approach to the overall model isn’t set in stone, and there’s no right way to do it. In the academic world, it’s sometimes called “training by grad student” – the point where the only thing to do is move forward through laborious trial and error. Still, it worked well enough, and in the end, Wylie says, “we built 253 algorithms, which meant there were 253 predictions per profiled record”. The goal was achieved: a model that could effectively take the Facebook likes of its subjects and work backwards, filling in the rest of the columns in the spreadsheet to arrive at guesses as to their personalities, political affiliations and more. By the end of August 2014, Wylie had the first successful outputs: 2.1m profiled records, from 11 target US states, the plan being that they would be used to communicate and refine messages in Mercer and Steve Bannon-backed Republican campaigns leading up to the 2016 primaries (Wylie left before these). “What that number represents is people who not only have their Facebook data, voter data, and consumer data (which was all matched up), but also had an additional 253 predictions or scores that were then appended to their profile.” Those 253 predictions were the “secret sauce” that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could offer its customers. Using Facebook itself, advertisers are limited to broad demographic strokes, and a few narrower algorithmically determined categories – whether you like jazz music, say, or what your favourite sports team is. But with 253 further predictions, Cambridge Analytica could, Wylie says, craft adverts no one else could: a neurotic, extroverted and agreeable Democrat could be targeted with a radically different message than an emotionally stable, introverted, intellectual one, each designed to suppress their voting intention – even if the same messages, swapped around, would have the opposite effect. Wylie brings up the anodyne political statement that a candidate is in favour of jobs. “Jobs in the economy is a good example because it’s a meaningless message. Everyone’s pro-jobs in the economy. So in that sense, using just the message of ‘I am in favour of jobs in the economy’, or ‘I have a plan to fix jobs in the economy’, you cannot differentiate yourself from your opponent. “But one of the things that we found was that actually when you unpack what is a job for different people, different people engage with constructs with different motivations and value sets that are interrelated with their dispositions.” What that means in practice is that the same blandishment can be dressed up in different language for different personalities, creating the impression of a candidate who connects with voters on an emotional level. “If you’re talking to a conscientious person” – one who ranks highly on the C part of the Ocean model – “you talk about the opportunity to succeed and the responsibility that a job gives you. If it’s an open person, you talk about the opportunity to grow as a person. Talk to a neurotic person, and you emphasise the security that it gives to my family.” Thanks to the networked nature of modern campaigning, in theory all these messages can be delivered simultaneously to different groups. Towards the end of the campaign, once the messaging has settled in, they can even be automated, Mad Libs-style, with an algorithm churning through a thesaurus to find the perfect combination of words to win over different subgroups. Of course, it isn’t all blandishments. One message used to boost rightwing turnout attacked same-sex marriage. “It’s funny, because this is so offensive and implicitly homophobic, but it’s a team of gays that created it,” Wylie says. “It was targeting conscientious people. It was a picture of a dictionary and it said ‘Look up marriage and get back to me’. For someone who is conscientious, it is a compelling message: a dictionary is a source of order, and a conscientious person is more deferential to structure.” At a certain point, psychometric targeting moves into the realm of dog-whistle campaigning. Images of walls proved to be really effective in campaigning around immigration, for instance. “Conscientious people like structure, so for them, a solution to immigration should be orderly, and a wall embodied that. You can create messaging that doesn’t make sense to some people but makes so much sense to other people. If you show that image, some people wouldn’t get that that’s about immigration, and others immediately would get that.” The actual issues, for Wylie, are simply the “plain white toast” of politics, waiting for the actual flavour to be loaded on. “No one wants plain white toast.” The job of the data, he says, is to “learn the particular flavour or spice” that will make that toast appealing. While this was undoubtedly a highly sophisticated targeting machine, questions remain about Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric model – ones Wylie, perhaps, isn’t best placed to answer. When Kogan gave evidence to parliament in April, he suggested that it was barely better than chance at applying the right Ocean scores to individuals. Maybe that edge is enough to matter – or maybe CA was selling snake oil. And even if individuals were correctly labelled with the five factors, is advertising to them based on that really as simple as slightly hokey-sounding appeals to love of order, or fear of the other? That said, there’s clearly something in it. Take a look instead at a patent filed in 2012 on “determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications”. “Stored personality characteristics may be used as targeting criteria for advertisers ... to increase the likelihood that the user … positively interacts with a selected advertisement,” the patent suggests. Its author? Facebook itself."

          "headline": "Sean Penn: ‘Some of my best laughs have come out of the worst reviews’",
          "bodyText": "Sean Penn walks into a low-key restaurant not far from his house and slides undetected into a seat at the back. It is a misty day in Malibu, 15 miles north of LA, and the actor appears in familiar, I-don’t-care guise: beat-up leather jacket, brushfire hair (which, in light of the views he will air about female vanity in Hollywood, I feel bound to report may be more vibrant than nature intended), with the jittery energy of a man who has stood for too long next to very loud speakers. The 57-year-old greets me affably, to my surprise: while Penn may be long admired for his acting, he is denigrated for almost everything else. He is known to be pugnacious, short-tempered, long-winded, a man who yells at photographers and smokes on TV. And now he has written a lunatic novel. “It’s the most fun I’ve had professionally,” he croaks and leans back in his chair. A few days before our meeting, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff was the subject of a full-page newspaper ad in which the publishers, rather cleverly, ran lines from the book’s worst reviews and asked readers to make up their own minds. The novel, which follows the adventures of its eponymous hero as he goes around selling septic tanks and murdering old people, is a satire of American consumer culture and the cult of image, and for weeks its excesses have been gleefully documented. Penn writes as if every word has been put through a thesaurus: for “face”, read “dermal mask”; for “quiet”, “lingering symphony of silence”; a man with good hearing has “extraordinary auditory augmentation efficiency”. So it goes on, until we reach: “Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.” Cherrypicking these extravagances has provided us with a jolly good laugh, but here’s the odd thing: taken as a whole, there is something quite thrilling about Bob Honey, a hallucinatory effect that makes the novel at times almost feel like a piece of performance art. Linger long enough in the world of Penn’s prose and one starts to lose all purchase on reality, a sort of brain slide that Penn insists was intentional. “It was meant to be challenging,” he says. “Meant to have you stop-the-rhythm to go and look something up.” If he talks in a word fog, it is because he prefers “to be understood by osmosis. If I’m being brief, I assume [people] will fill in, or if I am not being brief” – the far greater likelihood, on the evidence of our chat – “the tangents would be connected by the other person.” He hoped the book might work along similar lines. The result, while largely insane, does provoke an emotional response in the reader and for that reason alone might be judged a success. “I wrote the Sean-by-osmosis version in about 30 days,” Penn says, after which “I rewrote for two years”, before selling it to Simon &amp; Schuster, where “I got lucky; Peter [Borland] totally got the book. I felt I was being supported by a really smart reader.” Was he edited? “He wasn’t looking to change anything,” Penn says cheerfully. “But he did send me great notes which said, ‘I don’t understand this. Do you want me to?’” (In most cases Penn replied “yes”; in some, “not so much”.) The suggestion he was indulged because of his celebrity is one he finds baffling. “No, because I wouldn’t have done it any other way. When people listen to the advice they get, it usually robs the soul of the piece. In the movies, they’re not thinking about whether it has impact on them; they’re thinking about whether it will impact the box office.” This rather quaint view of publishing – as an industry devoid of commercial principles and certainly not the kind of business that might judge a book by a famous actor to have greater value as a car crash than as something more credible – is the main source of Penn’s enthusiasm for novel writing, which he sees as a less mediated form of expression than acting. But why would he trade in something he is indisputably world class at – Penn has won two Oscars, for Milk and Mystic River – for something he is indisputably not? The answer is burnout, what he calls “my great source of alienation from my peers, actors who would rather sell a movie than make one”. Where these actors are “brands”, and where even a movie he loves “is the sum of compromises at its best”, Bob Honey, by contrast, is “all mine. It’s been said you never complete a film, you abandon it, and I didn’t abandon this. I stand by every line exactly how I wrote it.” Has he seen the worst reviews? “I have a sense of them. It’s keep-your-day-job shit. A bunch of children, schadenfreude, whatever. And in the end, some of the best laughs I’ve got have been the one-liners that have come out of the worst reviews.” Through long espousal of leftwing politics, including vocal protests against the Iraq war and support of Hugo Chávez and Raúl Castro, Penn is used to being unpopular. Does it hurt to be mocked? “Well, mocked means the person’s an idiot.” Penn smiles crookedly and shutters his lids. “I’m not vulnerable at all.” There are two images of Sean Penn that rival the memory of his greatest screen roles. Up there with Carlito’s Way, or Dead Man Walking, or his role as Harvey Milk – the 2008 biopic of California’s first gay elected official and a performance for which one could almost forgive Penn any amount of bad behaviour off-screen – there is the shot of him in a boat rescuing survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and the one of his handshake with Mexican drug lord El Chapo. The latter, taken two years ago when Penn interviewed El Chapo for Rolling Stone, brought down on his head almost as much opprobrium as Bob Honey, for its perceived amateurism and for the way it seemed to apologise for a man with so much blood on his hands. Penn remains unrepentant. “Just because someone writes about stuff doesn’t mean they know about it. I know fathers who don’t know their own families. Most of these journalists on this subject know fucking nothing and most never read my piece. They read the excerpts. Then you get a talking head like a Don Winslow [on CNN], I’ve read his books cover to cover and he’s a functioning moron, and people think he’s something. That’s their resident expert. It’s like Henry Kissinger is their resident expert.” The gung-ho activism is more complicated and, on closer inspection, much more admirable than the caricature suggests. If there is precedent for Penn wading into a job about which he knows nothing and nailing it through sheer bloody-mindedness, it is here, in his experiences with aid. In 2010, Penn went to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake and set up the J/P Haitian Relief Organization, an agency that has, by all accounts, been enormously successful and helped thousands of Haitians find shelter and medical relief. In a piece in the New York Times in 2011, by which time Penn had been in Haiti for almost a year, veteran aid workers lined up to praise him. The question of what he was doing in Haiti in the first place has roots in his inability to find equilibrium at home. The most persuasive passages in Bob Honey are those in which Penn writes of his character’s insomnia. When I ask if this comes from experience, he takes a big breath. “So this goes back as far as I, or my mother, can remember. I was born at 3.45am and I generally fall asleep at 3.45am. I’ve been to Zen centres, done sleep studies, everything. I could never get myself to go to sleep. I’d get up, sometimes, with no sleep at all. And I was getting older, so I wasn’t able to push through this thing mentally.” Eventually a doctor prescribed Ambien: “But it doesn’t work like it used to. It doesn’t keep me asleep, but I get to sleep and at least get three hours. Then you’re watching the clock for the time you have to get up, and it’s getting closer and closer.” Some of Penn’s wilder behaviour makes more sense, perhaps, when looked at in the context of a man who has never had more than three unbroken hours’ sleep. “Yuh. Judgment issues,” he says, raising his eyebrows in what is almost certainly a reference to the time, in 2009, when a court made him attend anger management classes after an altercation with a photographer. It probably didn’t improve your temper, I suggest. “No. Nor the thoughts that lead to a temperamental response.” One result of this is that Penn often feels himself to operate best in crisis mode. He quotes a line from Cutter’s Way, a movie from 1981 starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard in which a woman kills herself to get away from her alcoholic husband, and the final line of which is: “You know, the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy, I take straight.” “There’s been a lot of that in my life,” Penn says and he relates it, obliquely, to how he is able to function effectively in a destabilised environment such as Haiti after the earthquake. “I think tragedy can also be urgency. I find myself going calm, and being demanding. I can bring an American arrogance to anywhere in the world.” He smiles. “Look, in the movie business you tell your crew: ‘I need this set done yesterday.’ When I got to Haiti and I saw how NGOs worked, it would be like: ‘This patient needs this, now, and this is the person to get in touch with.’ Then I had six other people asking me six other things. When I circled back half an hour later to the first one and said, ‘Did you get it?’ they said, ‘We’re waiting for a response, we sent an email.’ I said, ‘You sent an email? Give me your phone, I’m going to call.’ And it drove me fucking mad.” Pretty quickly, Penn’s outfit became known as an agency that got things done quicker than the NGOs and he calls it “the easiest kind of work to do in an emergency, because it’s emergency related”. It was triage. He nods. “It’s the easiest, commonsense work. There’s a kid in the street, a truck’s going to hit it, do you know that the sidewalk is clear of paedophiles? No. I’ll make my apologies later.” It is fascinating that the self-important urgency of a Hollywood movie set can be translated to a disaster zone, but think about it, Penn says: “It’s the same business, the stakes are higher.” There’s even overlap with the sanitation logistics of shooting a movie. “You’ve gotta get porta potties for people.” Was he surprised when allegations were made last year that aid workers, including Roland Van Hauwermeiren, the head of Oxfam in Haiti, used sex workers? “I don’t know why it wasn’t a bigger scandal earlier. I was reading about it in the Haitian press when I was in Haiti in the beginning. Roland Van Hauwermeiren was probably the best country director of an organisation there. Of course, you’re not the best anything if you’re looking the other way on that stuff. Or, worse yet, if you’re participating.” In his own organisation, Penn had a policy of “no tolerance” right down to the rule that “if you smoke one joint, you’re fired”. In fact he ended up relaxing the drugs rule for his indigenous workers, because “how am I controlling that when my local workers went back to their homes at night? I stopped being an idiot with that.” For the imports, mostly Americans or Brits, however, “You don’t come to this country to break its laws.” And when someone in his organisation did break a rule? Well, Penn says, “There’s no organisation, including my own, where you don’t have something happen. And you deal with it; you certainly want to take it transparent.” The cover-up, he says, is the biggest problem. “I’ve known of situations where big organisations discovered something and did an investigation, and fired somebody – and because they didn’t want a lawsuit from that person, another organisation would hire them; it’s like passing on priests. In our organisation, I’d get on the phone to whoever the violator was and say, ‘If I hear you are ever trying to get a job in one of these organisations, I’m coming to your home town, and I’m going to rent out the movie theatre and show a documentary about you and make sure your parents are there.’” Why does he think an aid worker, who presumably starts out with good intentions, gets to the point of exploiting desperate women this way? “I can have theories,” Penn says, “but they’re the same theories one would apply to someone who abuses their children. How do you do that?” In light of these life-or-death stakes, Penn is unsympathetic to what he seems to regard as more trivial abuses closer to home, particularly those involving celebrity exposure. A week before we meet, he appeared in the gossip columns for dining with Charlie Rose, the disgraced former TV host fired from PBS and CBS for inappropriate behaviour around female staff. Penn is not, it is safe to say, on board with #MeToo, which he describes as “not intellectually honest”, “a movement led by mania” and full of “self-aggrandisement and venting”. At the end of Bob Honey, he writes a poem defending Charlie Rose and appearing to lament the demise of Louis CK. Clearly, I say, Penn thinks his friend was mistreated. “He says one thing happened; other people said another thing happened. I wasn’t there. What I do think is we maybe should be very careful; for example, are we now going to say we will never celebrate Thomas Jefferson again: slave holder, that’s all you are? Charlie Rose provided one of the only sophisticated dialogue programmes, and I don’t know what the percentages are, but I know that there are some lies that have been told publicly about people; I know of some serious omissions. I’m talking about women towards men.” This is a personal issue for Penn, who in 2016 won a court-appointed apology from the director Lee Daniels, who erroneously implied the actor was guilty of domestic violence. Romantic relationships don’t seem to be Penn’s strong point. The worst bits of Bob Honey are those involving the character’s ex-wife, a harridan called Helen, about whom he is so vicious, I had wondered whether Penn’s own ex-wife might have commented on it. Penn gives me a dry look. “Which ex-wife?” he says. Oh. I had momentarily forgotten about Madonna, to whom Penn was married from 1985 to 1989. “The mother of your kids,” I say. (Penn and Robin Wright, who were married for 14 years, have Dylan and Hopper, both in their 20s.) “No; these characters are amalgamations of a lot of things and she’s not a character in the book.” Penn pauses. “I don’t think the book would be either one of my ex-wives’ cup of tea. They both thought that I talked too much in ways that were too complicated.” He laughs. “I don’t have a lot of conversations with my most recent ex, but my first ex, we have a close friendship.” What does he think Madonna would say about the book? “I think if she was reading it, she’d say, ugh, I’ll read this some other time.” Anyway, Penn says, returning to the subject of #MeToo, “I don’t ever want to be in a movement. I don’t trust any movement. The anti-war movement did not sustain. We’re back in wars.” But going back to his friend Charlie, surely the lesson of this is: don’t wander around naked in front of your staff if you don’t want to get sacked. “I don’t disagree with that,” Penn says. “I go back to my original thing, which is that if that’s what the individual that happened to is asking for, then they have a legal case to go through, or the company has a decision to make. But when the company is making that decision under the pressure of… a movement that is led by mania, I get worried for both [sides].” There is a libertarian streak in Penn that is impossible to miss. I repeat a wince-making line from Bob Honey, which Penn almost certainly considers to be a liberal statement: “Getting older in America is tough on a woman; seeing what she’ll do to avoid it is tough on a man.” I assume Penn approved of Frances McDormand’s unadorned style at the Oscars this year? He takes a big breath: “When my kids were growing up, there was a thing called the surgery channel and I would watch this thing and get into hysterical laughter. One slice and you’re a human body! We’re the fucking same! But where I really became a giggling 12-year-old girl was volunteering for cosmetic surgery: you have someone who’s anaesthetised, and they’re doing the most vile things to them, and I would get so hysterical. You bring up Frances McDormand. What do you do to be more beautiful than that? That fucking woman walks into a room and you don’t know if you want to kiss her, eat her farts or bite her toes off, you just want to be around that energy.” As opposed, he says, to “the vanity that errs on the side of violence against oneself, physical violence. It’s crazy.” But there are market forces at play. You’re still viable as a leading man at 57; a woman is not. “But isn’t it changing? There’s Meryl out there. Also, in terms of the social/sexual part of it, I think more and more – I mean my ex-wife just married a 30-year-old guy she met two months earlier. [Wright is reported to have married a French fashion PR manager earlier this year.] You see that dynamic shifting. When I would try to console a woman in the business who maybe wasn’t getting the opportunities I was because they were a woman, I’d say, well, which parts are you not getting? Because, man or woman, most parts are shit. Most movies are shit. If you look at the really talented women – Julianne Moore never has trouble getting a job. The opportunities are there.” Does he understand why his countrymen voted for Trump? “I have a pretty good idea. We became celebritised,” he says. “I don’t buy People magazine. But when people complain that someone took a picture of them or that their privacy is being invaded, I’m like, yeah? Fuck you. I just spent my entire adult life with you telling me that because I want to express myself as an actor, that that comes with the territory. Well, it comes with the territory for you, now, and you bought those fucking People magazines. You made that happen.” He is jabbing his finger at me across the table. “When I go like this, I’m not at my best,” he says. “So two sides that are not at their best, it gets very shallow.” Penn has a disdain for the idea of the personal brand. “Branding is being! Branding is being! The algorithm of modern binary existentialism,” he writes in Bob Honey, a line I read out to him now. “Yeah,” says Penn, lowering his eyes and looking sage. What does “the algorithm of modern binary existentialism” mean? He snaps his eyes open. “Well. Binary – two components. When you’re taking an algorithm that’s going to identify the two components, and, there are, I think I talk about in the book also… it’s America today.” There follows a long story about how easy it is to buy components for a bomb in the US. “I’ve just gone off on the word binary. But I think it’s self-explanatory, in there. Huh.” Anyway, he says, the reason people voted for Trump is “because I think there’s a mental health problem in this country. It’s rage over reason. There’s a lot going on that was going on in Nazi Germany; we’re finding scapegoats, groups to hate, whether it be of a race, or so-called lefty Hollywood, so that’s part of why I want to write something – I only have my sense of humour to offer. I didn’t want to just be angry all the time.” And he isn’t. There is an underlying humour to Penn’s rants that is often lost in translation and while I find much of what he says preposterous, arrogant and occasionally delusional, to my surprise, I also find him likable and funny – a genuine American eccentric. As we get up to leave, I can’t help laughing. “Sorry. I keep thinking about the fact that Madonna thought you were boring.” “I love her,” Penn says, and laughs. Is she a good egg? “Such a good egg.” We go outside to his pick-up truck and he introduces me to Flyboy, his six-month-old golden retriever. After Penn has gone, I call a friend with a degree in philosophy. “Does ‘the algorithm of modern binary existentialism’ mean anything?” I ask. After the laughter has died down, he says, “I think he means… in modern life everything is black and white. But existentialism refers to a specific tradition in philosophy; he surely just means existence.” No matter; Penn has a lot more to say. Before leaving he told me: he is hard at work on Bob Honey, the sequel. • Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff by Sean Penn is published by Simon &amp; Schuster at £14.99.

          "headline": "'Single women fiction': how a genre went from subversive to sad",
          "bodyText": "Genres are funny things. For every copy of Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake that gets shelved under fiction, there’s someone who’ll argue that it is really sci-fi. Technically, The Moonstone is one of the first detective novels, but it always finds itself categorised as classic literature. And let’s not get started on politicians’ memoirs. The fact that Amazon, with its love of increasingly specific categorisation – does anyone really look at “crime, thrillers and mystery” and want to filter it even more precisely to “technothrillers”? - has come up with the genre “single women fiction” is simultaneously unsurprising and depressing. There isn’t, after all, a genre called “single men fiction” on Amazon (if there was, it’d just be wall-to-wall Philip Roth and Will Self). It’s listed as a subgenre of “women’s fiction” and mostly consists of books by women, the latest David Duchovny novel, Miss Subways, a rare exception. Of course, we know what the term women’s fiction normally means: it’s code for “not-as-good”, “commercial” and “probably about feelings and kissing and maybe chocolate”. And single women fiction? It’s the new chick lit. As ever, men’s experience is the norm and women’s is the subgenre. It’s why people think Pride and Prejudice is a love story, rather than a biting social satire about the precarious economic status of women during the Napoleonic war. But the novel with a single woman as protagonist wasn’t always the derided art form it is today. In the late 19th century, it was positively transgressive. The 1890s saw a flurry of “New Woman” novels, in which heroines sought fulfilment, not escape, from their single state. Usually with on-the-nose titles like Ella Hepworth Dixon’s The Story of a Modern Woman or Annie Holdsworth’s Joanna Traill, Spinster, they modelled a different life for women and were unflinching about the challenges it brought, along with its rewards. With Britain suffering a shortage of men, in part because of the Crimean war, there simply weren’t enough marriage prospects to go around unless you waited for someone to become a widower or lock their first wife up in an attic. These sometimes unintentional spinsters were termed “surplus women”, but when higher education and a working middle class began to open up to women in the latter part of the century, suddenly there were new stories to be told. In those days, books about single women were considered dangerous, potential stirrers of feminist thought. But if the cultural arbiters of the day had really wanted women to feel guilty about reading – or writing – these books, then they should have done what contemporary critics do and dismiss them as frivolous or cliched (or simply not talk about them at all). Chick lit and “grip lit” are labelled thus because God forbid they simply be called literature. All these single women, having careers and cocktails and success instead of only popping into the narrative to provide children and sex; whatever next! The term “up lit” is the latest term being thrown around; and once again, it only seems to have attached itself to female authors, such as Gail Honeyman and Ruth Hogan, as though these novels that combine being commercial success with not being miserable are nothing more than word-Prozac. Honeyman’s celebrated debut, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, neither requires nor suits the label. Far from uplifting, it’s a deeply uncomfortable read about one woman’s abuse and trauma that, from a male perspective – or a male author – would likely have been deemed plain old literature. This is, of course, something of a tempest in the literati’s teapot – after all, the Amazon listing is just an algorithm set up to sell more books. But there’s something insidious lurking beneath it, something women who write are reminded of at every turn: they’re the exception, not the rule. Even though it is demonstrably untrue – women both write and read more – it’s another odd little way of reminding women to leave the serious literature to the men."

          "headline": "The cancer screening scandal is no surprise – older women are too often ignored",
          "bodyText": "How can almost half a million women go missing, and nobody notice? Yet that is what we are told has happened. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, came to parliament on Wednesday to confess that up to 450,000 older women in England may have somehow fallen off the breast cancer screening system, thanks to a computer glitch. Unravelling the real-life consequences of that is a complicated and contested business, but Hunt said it was likely there were people who “would have been alive today if this had not happened”; and that up to 270 lives may have been shortened. The next few days will be difficult ones for already overloaded GP surgeries and screening clinics, with anxious women now calling the hotline set up by the Department of Health in their thousands. But brushing something like this under the carpet was hardly an option. It should be said, however, that this is not another Windrush scandal. It’s down to a faulty computer algorithm, rather than to some kind of hostile medical environment; the glitch that wrongly cancelled some women’s scans crept in accidentally in 2009, during the setting up of a pilot project on whether it was worth expanding the screening programme, not in some attempt to chop it back. Nonetheless, eight years is a hell of a long time for nobody to notice. Older women – that perennially invisible group – can be forgiven for wondering whether it would have happened to anyone else. Those worst affected would have been in their late 60s when their scans were cancelled and perhaps in their 70s when they started getting sick, a time of life when bad news is half-expected and medicine becomes mainly about managing decline not reversing it; when routine visits to the doctor end in apologetic mumbling that unfortunately, these things are to be expected when you get older. And older women are so often not the type to make a fuss. They’re of a generation that waits to be served, doesn’t like to bother anyone, trusts the people in charge to know what they’re doing. Of late, they have not been repaid well for that trust. Think of the Waspi (Women’s Against State Pension Inequality) women, who didn’t realise the government had moved the goalposts on their state pension age until it was too late, and whose subsequent rage at their poverty has fallen on deaf ears. Think even of the middle-aged women who suffered for years from complications from vaginal mesh, whose complaints of agonising pain and infections weren’t taken nearly seriously enough at first, because they were often post-menopausal and well, what do you expect at your age, after a few difficult childbirths? They too found it difficult to get a public hearing, because incontinence and pelvic pain are not considered glamorous stories. Given the indignities heaped upon them – their erasure from a culture still fixated on the young – it’s surprising in a way that older women are not more radicalised politically. To be fair to the NHS, it’s possible that the inquiry Hunt has ordered will discover that this isn’t as bad as it initially looks. Most of the women who missed a scan would thankfully have been perfectly healthy; some of those who didn’t get called in will have had scans for other reasons, such as finding a lump by themselves or being part of a programme of extra checks scheduled for women who have had breast cancer in the past. It may be that there were never enough cases clustered in the same place for doctors to spot a pattern of patients presenting with tumours who inexplicably hadn’t had mammograms for years, or for clinics to wonder why women who diligently showed up for previous scans had mysteriously stopped coming. My heart goes out to all the grieving families who will now be wondering if their mothers and wives could have lived for longer, but sadly even some of those who died after missing a scan might not necessarily have been saved by screening. Early diagnosis gives a much better chance of survival, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of anything. The sad thing, however, is that the women themselves presumably weren’t asking questions. When the letters stopped coming, they must have just assumed they’d had their lot from the NHS. It’s an age when you get used to dropping off people’s radar, after all. It is partly to avoid such human blind spots, of course, that algorithms like those our public services now use to manage data exist in the first place. Machines are meant to excel at routine tasks like churning out appointments and they don’t make emotional judgments about what you can expect at your age (or at least, not unless they’re programmed by people who do). But we have grown so used to relying on computers to do the thinking and the remembering for us that we barely realise how much has been delegated to systems we don’t particularly understand, and didn’t realise could fail until it was too late – as those TSB customers still struggling to get into their bank accounts after an almighty car crash of an IT upgrade will know. The cervical cancer scandal currently unfolding in Ireland, where early abnormalities were not picked up in the cases of over 200 women who went on to develop cancer, and who in some cases have since died, is another grim reminder that no system is infallible. It is important not to over-romanticise the past. These scandals did not used to happen, but only because worse ones did; before screening, more women died unnecessarily. For all its flaws and the hotly debated risks of over-treatment, screening has saved thousands of lives over the years, including in my own family. The risk remains small, but if you’re putting off a smear test, prostate check or mammogram then for heaven’s sake, go. But it isn’t women’s fault that, for whatever reason, the system missed any clue that something had gone awry for eight years. And all too often, dismissiveness and casualness is what older women have been taught to expect from a society that looks right through them. They need to be reassured that the doctor will, in all possible senses of the word, see them now. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "Google, Facebook and Apple have too much power and are engaging in anti-competitive practices that are having a detrimental effect on journalism, News Corp Australia has told the competition regulator. “Digital platforms impose restrictive contract terms and engage in aggressive mergers and acquisitions in order to neutralise emerging competition and extend their market power,” Australia’s biggest media company said in a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s digital platforms inquiry. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, has said consumers are concerned about the survival of quality news media as well as the harvesting of their data by dominant digital platforms. News Corp said legislative change might be required to stop the digital giants swamping local news organisations, and proposed an algorithm review board to “remedy algorithmic distortions”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Its submission said Facebook and Google directly influenced about three-quarters of internet traffic, “exerting a strong influence on how readers access and engage with News Corp Australia’s content”. “Prior to the advent of digital platforms, the creation of news and journalism followed a virtuous circle whereby readership drove subscription revenue, which drove advertising spend, which, in turn, drove investment in content,” the submission said. “While digital platforms have had some positive impacts, they must be balanced against the significant negative impacts. Fundamentally, digital platforms have undermined this virtuous circle by treating news as an add-on to the consumer-facing services and showcasing as much content for free as possible. As consumers gravitate to the platforms so too do advertisers, further undermining the sustainability of publishers’ business models.” Australia has lost about 3,000 journalists’ jobs since the growth of digital platforms escalated about 10 years ago, according to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance submission, one of 57 published on Thursday. The job losses have come at a significant cost to media companies – Fairfax Media, publisher of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, has spent $490m on redundancies in the past 10 years. It now has 3,917 full-time journalist positions compared with 7,126 a decade ago. About 1,400 positions have been shed at News Corp’s Australian titles during the same period. Fairfax has echoed the concerns of its biggest newspaper competitor, saying its advertising revenue for the capital city mastheads has shrunk dramatically since 1999: from $800m to $225m, without taking into account the effects of inflation. According to Fairfax’s submission, Google and Facebook captured three-quarters of Australian online advertising expenditure in 2016 and could capture 84% of the global digital ad spend in 2017, excluding China. Fairfax said Google and Facebook should take their share of responsibility for fake news and filter bubbles, and the consequent impact on social cohesion and democracy. “It is our assessment that the role played by digital platforms today is not entirely dissimilar to the traditional role of publishers as controllers of physical distribution networks,” Fairfax said. “Just as publishers are required to take responsibility for the content accessible through their products, platforms should be responsible for the content they amplify and distribute.” News Corp criticised the strategies employed by the digital platforms, including undermining paywalls with free content or the promotion of free content that has been repurposed from exclusive articles behind a paywall. The news agency Australian Associated Press said in its submission it had lost clients and the impact on the business had resulted in bureaus being closed and reporters losing jobs. “For AAP the changing commercial dynamics have resulted in the loss of clients, specifically broadcasters, who have cancelled AAP subscription services worth hundreds of thousands of dollars because in the words of one TV media executive: ‘We just Google it’,” it said. In its submission, Facebook said it was helping journalism by providing a free global distribution service for publishers."

          "bodyText": "Big Tech is sorry. After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains. Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook – who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network – has publicly lamented the “unintended consequences” of the platform he helped create: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook’s “like” button and Gchat, regrets having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.” Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 study from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial. In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the “cognitive surplus” unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the “internet president”. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible. Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good – and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects. Internet anxiety isn’t new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the “tech humanists”. Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity. It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane – that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier – we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don’t “hijack” our minds. The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former “design ethicist” at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: the Tech and Society Solutions Lab, which aims to “maximise the tech industry’s contributions to a healthy society”. As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech’s loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled – and praised by – the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others. But tech humanism’s influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media’s role in encouraging “mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions”, and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently claimed he wants to improve the platform’s “conversational health”. Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to “move fast and break things”, seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, he announced that Facebook had a new priority: maximising “time well spent” on the platform, rather than total time spent. By “time well spent”, Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with “friends” rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these “more meaningful” activities. Zuckerberg’s choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer snapped a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook’s new emphasis on “time well spent”, under the heading “wellbeing”. This new concern for “wellbeing” may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems – the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley. But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful. * * * The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be “aligned” with humanity – and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features a section entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history. “In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,” the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by “technology that extracts attention and erodes society”, the text asserts that “humane design is the solution”. Drawing on the rhetoric of the “design thinking” philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design “starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately”. There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, “humanising” technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a “humanised” form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users’ everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse – and produced the digitised world that today’s tech humanists now lament. The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores. Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn’t the only mid-century crisis around computing. Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom. But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley’s reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face. The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing “human” modes of living. They wanted their machines to be “extensions of man”, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock “human potential” rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that “served human interest, not machine”. Brand’s disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers – not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing “human potential”. No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand’s vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. “He got the notion of tools for human use,” Brand told Jobs’ biographer, Walter Isaacson. Building those “tools for human use” turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch; you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment. In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us. * * * Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation. It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting; with ash you could fertilise the soil; with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, “founded all the arts of men.” All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. Recent research suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed “a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions” for this purpose. The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that “we” are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn’t have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said. Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do – but you probably type faster. The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn’t change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be. Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature – as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. “We have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically,” Tristan Harris has declared. Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology’s Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health “the root of the whole thing”, and Harris has compared using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don’t put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote – you call a doctor. This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. “Facebook appeals to your lizard brain – primarily fear and anger,” says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: “Imagine you had an input cable,” he has said. “You’re trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?” The Center for Humane Technology’s website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: “going greyscale” by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology’s harmful effects on young people’s “digital health and well-being”; and a “Ledger of Harms” – a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building “healthier” products. These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use – a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving. Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as “sick” isn’t the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology’s proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the individual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry’s structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it. This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits. * * * One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned. When Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would prioritise “time well spent” over total time spent, it came a couple weeks before the company released their 2017 Q4 earnings. These reported that total time spent on the platform had dropped by around 5%, or about 50m hours per day. But, Zuckerberg said, this was by design: in particular, it was in response to tweaks to the News Feed that prioritised “meaningful” interactions with “friends” rather than consuming “public content” like video and news. This would ensure that “Facebook isn’t just fun, but also good for people’s well-being”. Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent – but “the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable”. This may describe what users find valuable – but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, he said: “Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that’s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.” Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create “more monetisation opportunities”. How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook – but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called “coefficient”. This measures the strength of a connection between two users – Zuckerberg once called it “an index for each relationship”. Facebook records every interaction you have with another user – from liking a friend’s post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It’s reasonable to assume that you’re closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked. Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things. So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase “meaningful” interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn’t find valuable – such as watching viral videos – you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable. In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time. In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable – to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before. A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable – and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (£8.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m. * * * Today’s tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the “humanised” machines that became the basis for the industry’s enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash – and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making. Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology – one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address “humanity” in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine – as “cyborgs”, to quote the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway. To say that we’re all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can’t be a matter of making technology more “human”. This goal isn’t just impossible – it’s also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what’s best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species. The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power. Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many. There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of “humane designers”. They should be made by everyone, together. Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology – rather than the small group of people who have captured society’s wealth. What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley’s power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn’t exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook’s market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users – do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms track you around the internet. In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave – rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn’t enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms. This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a successful experiment in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned “smart city” of the kind being developed in Barcelona. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create. More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them. The tech backlash is an enormous opportunity – and one that may not come again for a long time. The old techno-utopianism is crumbling. What will replace it? Silicon Valley says it wants to make the world a better place. Fulfilling this promise may require a new kind of disruption.

          "headline": "Government suffers 10th Lords defeat on EU withdrawal bill – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The government suffered a 10th defeat over its flagship EU withdrawal bill when the House of Lords voted for an amendment that would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, told peers that Brexiters in his party are “playing with fire” and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland “that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent”. (See 4.59am.) The Brexit war cabinet delayed a decision on the UK’s customs arrangements after failing to reach agreement in a crunch meeting. The prime minister asked officials to draw up “revised proposals” for minister to consider again. MPs voted down a Labour attempt to gain access to documents detailing the Windrush crisis after Theresa May promised the government would review the decisions leading to it. Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said it was “nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation”. Women’s lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. This live blog is now closing down. In the Lords vote (see: 7.02pm), an analysis of the division list showed 19 Tory rebels backed the amendment, voting against the government. They included the former deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, and the former ministers, David Willetts, Douglas Hogg and Ros Altmann. The division list for the Commons vote on the Windrush scandal (see: 7.20pm) showed 180 of Labour’s 258 MPs voting in favour, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the ayes. The remainder of those who voted in favour included 28 SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats, four Plaid Cymru, the Green Party’s MP Caroline Lucas, and the independent MPs Kelvin Hopkins, Ivan Lewis and Jared O’Mara. The list also showed 306 of the Conservative Party’s 316 MPs voted against the motion, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the noes. Nine DUP MPs and the independent, Charlie Elphicke, also opposed the motion. Reacting to the government’s defeat over the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), the Liberal Democrat leader in the upper house, Lord Newby, said: This vote has recognised what Theresa May hasn’t: that the issue of the Northern Ireland border is of paramount importance. We cannot risk Conservative incompetence and Brexit dogma creating a hard border, and we will not allow years of strong relations within these islands to be jeopardised by Brexit. The government has survived the motion – MPs have voted down Labour’s motion to force ministers to disclose eight years of internal documents and correspondence about the Windrush scandal. The government imposed a three-line whip on Tory MPs to vote against and won by 316 votes to 221 – a majority of 95. Responding to the defeat, Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: This was an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation. After losing her human shield with the resignation of Amber Rudd, the architect of this scandal, Theresa May, ordered her MPs to vote to cover up the truth of her involvement. This is nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation and others who have been affected by the government’s heartless ‘hostile environment’, and flies in the face of the new home secretary’s promise to make things right. Tory MPs will now have to explain to the people whose lives have been turned upside down why they think they don’t deserve the facts to be known and don’t deserve proper justice. In the Commons, MPs are voting on Labour’s opposition day motion demanding the government release documents related to the treatment of the Windrush generation, with a result expected in a few minutes. Ministers have imposed a three-line whip on Conservative MPs to try to defeat the measure, which represents a change from recent Tory policy of not taking part in votes on opposition day motions. Responding to the government’s defeat in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: This vote sends a clear signal to the government that they must urgently find a solution to the Northern Ireland border. Ill-conceived compromises and unrealistic technological solutions are simply not good enough. The government’s failure to act is holding back the Brexit negotiations and creating deep uncertainty for communities in Northern Ireland. Ministers should back this amendment and accept Labour’s call for a new comprehensive customs union with the EU. The House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, delivering a 10th defeat to the government on its flagship Brexit legislation. Voting was 309 to 242, a majority of 67, for a cross-party amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill also enshrining support for the Good Friday peace agreement and continued “North-South” cooperation. While peers vote, it has been announced that a decision on the UK’s customs arrangements after Brexit has been put off after a crunch meeting of senior ministers failed to reach agreement. The prime minister, Theresa May, asked officials to draw up “revised proposals” after the government was unable to unite behind one of the two options on the table – both of which have already been dismissed as “unworkable” by EU officials. Downing Street sources said ministers in May’s “Brexit war cabinet” recognised there were “challenges” with both of the proposed solutions, which were first put forward last summer. The Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and his team are expected to come forward with amended proposals swiftly so that ministers can arrive at a preferred option possibly as early as next week. The new cabinet members, Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson, both came out in the meeting against the “customs partnership” model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Their opposition came after eurosceptic Tory backbenchers signalled that they regarded the partnership plan – branded “cretinous” by Jacob Rees-Mogg – unacceptable because he believed it would deliver Brexit in name only. Chris Patten is now concluding the Lords debate. He says invites Lord Duncan, the minister, to join him later on in voting for the government’s policy (a joke about how his amendment, which the government is opposing, is nominally just a statement of government policy). Referring to Lord Bridges’s speech (see 5.46pm), he says he would not have signed an agreement in December that could lead to the creation of a border in the North Sea. As a former Hong Kong governor, he knows enough about one country, two systems. He calls for a vote. And now peers are voting on the amendment. At this point I’m handing over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been reading Laura Kuenssberg’s tweets. (See 6.28pm.) On the basis of what she’s read, Sturgeon says government Brexit policy is “an utter shambles”. Back in the Lords Duncan is coming to the end of his speech. He says the government is firmly committed to the Good Friday agreement. It is entrenched in nine pieces of primary legislation, he says. But he says the political language in the second half of the amendment is not acceptable to the government. That does not mean the government is not committed to the Good Friday agreement, he says. Turning away from the House of Lords debate for a moment, here is some more on the cabinet sub committee meeting on customs. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From ITV’s Robert Peston From the Sun’s Harry Cole Duncan admits that much of what is in the Patten amendment reflects government policy. But the language is political, he says, particularly towards the end of the amendment. He says it is not the language of legislation. It will be for the government to write legislation when the withdrawal agreement is finalised. The text of the amendment, amendment 88, is in this document (pdf). In the Lords Lord Duncan of Springbank, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office and the Scotland Office, is now winding up for the government. He says the government is clear; it will not allow a border to be put in place in the North Sea. He says Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said some red lines might have to be adjusted. But that is not the case in Ireland, he says. He says Barnier should listen to both communities in Northern Ireland. In the Lords debate Paul Murphy, the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary, is winding up for the opposition. He says all sides in Ireland want to avoid the return of a hard border. All the amendment is doing is providing for what everyone wants, he says. Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, has told the House of Lords that Brexiters in his party are “playing with fire” and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland “that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent”. (See 4.59am.) He was speaking at the start of a debate on an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill he has tabled that would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The government is expected to lose when the amendment gets put to a vote, probably within the next half an hour. We will be covering the result. The government will review the decisions leading to the Windrush crisis, Theresa May has said, in an announcement intended to head off a Labour attempt to seek access to documents detailing the process. MPs are still debating the Labour motion, which will be put to a vote at 7pm. We will be covering that result too. Women’s lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. In the Lords debate Lord Bridges, the remain voter who served as a Brexit minister until the general election, said he would be supporting the government and voting against the Patten amendment. He said parliament had to give the government space to negotiate, and to allow it to make compromises. But he did not sound positive about the Brexit talks process. He told peers: My fear is that, come the autumn, the agreement on the future arrangements will be fudge. But it cannot be fudge containing the poison pill of that backstop. People voted to leave the European Union. They did not vote to break up the union that underpins our nation. So the double think of the December agreement, in which paragraph 49 says one thing and paragraph 50 another, cannot be allowed to seep into the final agreement. Bridges said, if peers wanted to take a stand about the Brexit withdrawal agreement because of its provisions for Ireland, the time to do that would be at the end of the process. Back in the House of Commons the Labour MP David Lammy was applauded as he likened the Home Office’s “compliant environment” to slavery. Lammy, whose father came to Britain from Guyana in 1956 and who has been a leading campaigner on behalf of the Windrush migrants, compliance was “written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors”. Referring to the way the new home secretary Sajid Javid prefers the term “compliant” to “hostile” to describe that way the government wants to create an environment that discourages illegal immigration, he said: On behalf of the Windrush generation, keep in mind that spiritual, let freedom reign: it will only reign when this country turns back from the path it’s on, ends the compliant environment in which I know my place, and starts along a humane path that at its heart has human rights ... The Windrush generation are here because of slavery. The Windrush story is a story of British empire and the Windrush community and its ancestors know what hostile and compliance means. We know what compliance means: it’s written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors. Slaves having to nod and smile when they were being whipped in a cotton field or a sugarcane field were compliant. Watching your partner being tied to a tree, beaten or raped on a plantation, is compliance. Twelve million people being transported as slaves from Africa to the colonies is a compliant environment. Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative MP who defected to Labour after the 1997 election and who subsequently sat in the House of Lords as a Labour peers, has died, the BBC reports. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has backed Downing Street (see 4.08pm) in talking up the case for an inquiry into the bullying allegations against John Bercow (which he denies). In a statement she said: It is for Dame Laura Cox QC to consider whether the terms of reference of her independent inquiry need to be expanded, to allow for individual investigations to take place. I’m sure she will be looking very carefully at how best to respond to these latest developments. We must call out unacceptable behaviour and stand by the House staff who do so much for us. The independent complaints procedure that I am establishing for all who work in or visit parliament will, I believe, make parliament one of the best places in the world to work, and to be treated with dignity. I am determined to stamp out all forms of bullying and harassment in parliament, and separate to these allegations, I encourage any member of House staff who has experienced mistreatment to provide their confidential testimony to Dame Laura Cox. Everyone in Westminster has a responsibility to play their part in changing the culture in parliament. In the House of Lords peers are debating the EU withdrawal bill again. We are expecting another vote, and another government defeat, on an amendment tabled by Chris Patten, the Conservative former cabinet minister and former European commissioner (and head of an inquiry into policing in Northern Ireland in the 1990s). Patten’s amendment, amendment 88, would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Opening the debate, Patten said that what he was asking for was in line with stated government policy. But he explained why he thought his amendment needed to be written into law. There are a number of members of the Conservative party in another place [the Commons] who are very keen for the over the cliff, onto the rocks Brexit and I think are making life rather more difficult for the prime minister to square circles than should be the case. Most of his speeech was about the importance of the Good Friday agreement. Here are some extracts. As the government say in their position paper, the issue of identity goes to the heart of the Good Friday agreement. And anybody who doubts that that’s the case should look at curbstones, should consider flags. In 2012 the city council in Belfast decided it wanted to reduce the number of times during the year that the union flag was flown. Result: a year of demonstrations and civil disorder, 130 police officers injured, a political office firebombed. Ask yourself this question. Why is the Northern Ireland not working at the moment? Because of an article about identity, because of an argument about parity of esteem for different cultures and different loyalties. That is why it is not working. The genius of the Good Friday agreement was to extract from nationalists the commitment that they would only ask for change constitutionally in Northern Ireland if it was the process of democracy. And on the other hand they were told they didn’t have to sign up to being loyal to all the usual symbols of what they regarded as the unionist state. It hasn’t meant that everyone is loving one another to bits. But it has ended the violence. Violence which saw the deaths of a thousand police officers and soldiers during the Troubles, twice as many as died in Iraq or Afghanistan ... There was a suggestion in the debate on the customs union that this House, by talking about that, by talking about the border and so on, was playing with fire. [Patten is referring to a speech by his Tory colleague Michael Forsyth.] I’ll tell you what I think playing with fire is. I think playing with fire is blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent, with a can of petrol and a box of matches in the other hand. I think that’s playing with fire. I think that’s what we’re really in danger of doing ... I don’t want to go back to the old triumphs, the old humiliations, the old animosities, the old feuds. I think it would be shameful, shameful and dishonourable, if this House was do to anything that made this more likely. I think it would be a stain on our history. Shona Robison, the Scottish government’s health secretary, has issued this statement about the breast screening bungle in England. She said: I want to reassure members of the public that this issue does not affect the NHS in Scotland and patients should be reassured that there are no problems with our breast screening programme records or IT systems. As usual, all women should continue to be aware of changes to their breasts and if they have any concerns they should see their GP. Scottish government officials will be working with Public Health England to identify any women affected in England who have subsequently moved to Scotland. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, has tweeted a picture today of the most important whiteboard in Whitehall. It belongs to Sue Gray, who is leaving her post as director general of the propriety and ethics team at the Cabinet Office, and it is the one that reportedly gets wheeled out ever time there is a government reshuffle. Gray used to help decide who could go where, and this is the surface where the moves used to get mapped out. This is from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh. According to ITV’s Robert Peston, the cabinet’s Brexit sub committee has wrapped up without coming to a conclusion on the customs union - as expected. (See 9.54am.) In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee is speaking now. The Conservative MP Jeremy Quin asks her, as a former government minister, what she thinks of the Labour motion. (See 10.51am.) He says it is very, very broad. It could lead to the disclosure of cabinet minutes, or information about communications with foreign governments, he says. Cooper says, although the motion says the Windrush papers should go to her committee, her committee has not discussed the matter. If the motion does get passed and her committee gets the papers, they will handle them “in a very responsible way”, she says. She says Windrush migrants ended by being treated as illegal immigrants by mistake. It is reasonable for the government to have targets, she says. But if there are targets, there must be safeguards. She also singles out the net migration target for criticism, saying that has encouraged the Home Office to deport people whether they are here legally or illegally. This is what Theresa May said at PMQs earlier when she announced an inquiry into the Windrush scandal. She told MPs: We all share the ambition to make sure we do right by members of the Windrush generation, which is why [Sajid Javid] will be announcing a package of measures to bring transparency on the issue, to make sure that the House is informed, and to reassure members of this House but, more importantly, to reassure those people who have been directly affected. Speed is of the essence and [Javid] will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge, with the intention of reporting back to this House before we rise for the summer. The review will have full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has condemned this as inadequate. Satbir Singh, its chief executive, issued this response. Nothing that the government has announced today in parliament will address the root causes of the Windrush scandal – namely the “hostile environment” policy. Hostility is still very much in play, the government still plans to roll Right to Rent out further to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which independent evidence by JCWI has proven discriminates and harms. The hostile environment continues unabated denying people health care, stopping doctors and nurses and other workers we so desperately need, working in our beloved NHS. If the government was truly committed to learning any lessons it would stop this hostility in its tracks, treat people as people, not numbers and carry out a fully independent review of the Home Office’s policies and practices. Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice and home affair spokeswoman, is speaking in the debate now. She says it is “astonishing” that civil servants could be receiving bonuses for deporting illegal immigrants. That’s “disgusting”, she says. The Times’ Sam Coates says Tory whips seem to be nervous about the vote tonight. Javid says safeguards are being put in place to ensure that ongoing enforcement measures against illegal immigrants do not impact on Windrush migrants. He is winding up now. He says he is not alone in feeling that what happened to the Windrush generation made him angry. Something like this must never happen again, he says. Javid says he will be bringing forward legislation for the fee exemptions, fee reductions and changes to the citizenship process for the Windrush migrants. He will also be consulting on the compensation scheme that has been promised. Javid says complying with Labour’s motion would take up too much government time. He describes it as a “massive and open-ended fishing expedition” which would require 100 officials to fulfil. The Conservative MP Simon Hoare intervenes. He says, since his appointment, Javid has been called “a coconut” and an “uncle Tom”. Javid says, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the hard left has been more prominent. They are associated with the rise of antisemitism. He challenges Corbyn, who is on the Labour front bench, to condemn the racist insults directed at him. Corbyn does not intervene. But Diane Abbott does. She says she knows what it is like to suffer racist abuse. She says she has condemned the abuse directed at Javid. Everyone on the Labour side condemns it, she says. Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, is speaking now. He says there are men and women who have been let down. As he told MPs on Monday, he will do whatever is necessary to put that right. Labour’s Catherine West intervenes. Is it true that bonuses are paid for the removal of illegal immigrants? Javid says bonuses are paid in the civil service. They are not a matter for ministers. Javid refuses to deny civil servants paid bonuses relating to the removal of illegal immigrants. Labour’s Stephen Doughty intervenes. He points out that Javid refused to deny that bonuses were paid. He asks West’s question again. Javid repeats the point about how ministers are not involved in bonuses. He says he has not looked at this. Back in the Commons, Abbott is still speaking. She says Theresa May has not resiled from the “hostile environment” policy. In 2012 she told the Daily Telegraph she wanted to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, Abbott says. She says Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, will find he is not in charge of Home Office policy. May still wants to decide it, she says. Abbottt says May’s policies created the problems for the Windrush generation. This issue will not go away. Labour will not stop until they get justice for the Windrush generation, she says. With Theresa May confronting her Brexit inner cabinet this afternoon, there was an intriguing little nugget in the post-PMQs briefing by her official spokesman. Brexiters have been briefing that they hope to use the meeting to force May to dump her preferred option of a “customs partnership”; while she and others including Philip Hammond are deeply sceptical about the alternative of “max fac”, or maximum facilitation. Asked about the PM’s remarks in the House that there were “a number of options” for post-Brexit customs arrangements under consideration, May’s spokesman said: Work has been ongoing on two options; that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along; the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed. Pressed about whether there were still two options on the table - or more - he repeatedly insisted there were, “a number of ways of taking this forward”. That will spark speculation that Downing Street is preparing to propose a third option, as a way through what has become an increasingly ugly public standoff. Abbott says there are still Windrush migrants who are afraid of coming forward. She turns to the compensation issue. People are anxious. They want assurances that the compensation scheme will be adequate, she says. Abbott says MPs want to have the figures for how many people have been deported. The Conservative MP James Cartlidge rises to make a point of order. Is is it order to table a motion asking the Queen to break the Data Protection Act, he asks. He says what the motion proposes in relation to text messages would contravene the new GDPR (general data protection regulation) rules. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, says that is not a point of order. Abbott says she has met Windrush migrants in detention centres. Abbott asks if Tory MPs will understand how voting against this motion will be seen in the Commonwealth, and by the Windrush generation. And will they understand how the Tory laughter comes across. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, rises on a point of order. There has been no laughing from the Conservative benches, she says. Abbott says people will have heard laughter. She says the Conservatives are not taking this seriously. Abbott says this story has been front page news across the Commonwealth, and not just in the Caribbean. What has been revealed about UK policy has been extremely damaging. That is one reason to clear up this mess, she says. Abbott says Labour does not support illegal immigration. She says Labour would prevent illegal immigrants coming into the country. But the government is not doing this because it has cut the number of border guards, she says. Abbott says she wants to address the role of the prime minister in this. A Conservative MP intervenes, and asks if Abbott is in favour of stopping illegal immigration. It is the second time a Tory has asked this. (Simon Hoare made a similar intervention a few minutes ago.) Some Labour MPs shout: “Wrong debate.” Abbott says nobody on the Labour benches supports illegal immigration. But it is distressing for Windrush generation migrants to hear the Conservatives keep dragging this back to illegal immigration. (The Conservatives are going for Abbott on this issue because she repeatedly refused to say what Labour would do about illegal immigrants in a TV interview earlier this week.) Abbott says May was to blame for the worst aspects of the “hostile environment” policy. She says May introduced a deport first, appeal later policy. She set deportation targets. And, given she set targets, May should have know that what Amber Rudd told the home affairs committee last week about the Home Office not having targets for removals was wrong, Abbott says. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is now opening the debate on the Labour Windrush motion. (See 10.51am.) She says the Windrush arrived in Britain on 22 June 1948. They were a patriotic generation who contributed a great deal to this country. This debate is about them, she says. Labour’s Chuka Umunna intervenes. He says many of the Windrush arrivals settled in Brixton, in his constituency. That was because there was a deep air raid shelter which housed them when they arrived. But it was also because that was near the job centre, he says. They wanted to work. The Hunt statement is over. Maria Miller, the Conservative MP and chair of the women and equalities committee, raises a point of order and asks about the new allegations about bullying by John Bercow. Miller says a member of the Commons staff has signed a non-disclosure agreement. Does John Bercow agree that Commons staff should not sign agreements like this? And will Bercow make a statement. Bercow says current and former staff are not constrained by any agreements from speaking to the inquiry into the bullying of Commons staff. He says the clerk of the Commons has sent Miller a note about these agreements, known as compromise agreements. He says he is not involved in decisions about getting staff to sign these agreements. On the subject of the allegations against him, Bercow says he has nothing to add to the statement he has already put out. Julian Lewis, a Conservative MP and a friend of Bercow’s, also rises. He asks Bercow to confirm that most of Bercow’s staff have been happy working for him. Bercow confirms that. Theresa May believes that the latest bullying allegations against Commons Speaker John Bercow should be “properly investigated”, Downing Street has said. Asked about the latest allegations of bullying by Bercow, which he denies, the prime minister’s spokesman said: The prime minister has been very clear from the start that there is no place for bullying or harassment of any kind in the workplace, including parliament. It is a matter for parliament to decide how to proceed, but the latest allegations are concerning and should be properly investigated. It’s important to note that the speaker denies the claims which have been made against him. Here is the apology Hunt delivered in his opening statement. He said: Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is that for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough. Many families will be deeply disturbed by these revelations, not least because there will be some people who receive a letter having had a recent diagnosis of breast cancer. We must also recognise that there may be some who receive a letter having had a recent terminal diagnosis. For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence. So on behalf of the government, Public Health England and the NHS, I apologise wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the suffering caused. Hunt says all GPs will be briefed on what the appropriate response to this failure should be. Hunt says his understanding is that, for every 1,000 women in their 70s, 12 have a breast cancer and three of those are life threatening. In his response to Hunt, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the “thoughts of the whole House will be with those whose screening was missed and who sadly lost their lives from breast cancer or who have subsequently developed cancer”. Ashworth welcomed Hunt’s “candour” in questioning why the problem was not picked up. He went on: Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected. Did the department receive any warnings in that time, is there any record of how many women raised concerns that they had not received appropriate screening, were there any opportunities to change this mistake which were missed? Hunt said: The existence of a potential issue was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Care by Public Health England in January, although at that stage their advice was that the risk to patients was limited. An urgent clinical evaluation took place and the matter was “escalated to ministers” in March this year by PHE “with clear clinical advice that the matter should not be made public”. That was so a plan could be put in place first to ensure “any remedies did not overwhelm the existing screening programme”. This is from Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s health secretary. Labour’s Diana Johnson asks why letters are not going out today to all 309,000 women affected. Hunt says the letters are being sent out as quickly as possible. They cannot all be sent out today, he says. He accepts people will have to wait a few weeks to find out if they are getting a letter, and he says he appreciates that this will cause a lot of concern to those involved. Commenting on Hunt’s announcement, Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK’s director of policy and public affairs, said: It’s very concerning to learn that so many women have not received an invitation to screening over a prolonged period of time. We know this may leave many women with questions about breast screening. If you suspect you have been directly affected by this or if you are over 50 and haven’t had a mammogram in the last three years and would like one, the NHS Choices website provides further information and the option to contact your local unit to book an appointment. It’s worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast, see your GP straight away. Labour’s Lisa Nandy says this announcement is “utterly heart-breaking”. Unless further resources are put into the system, other people will go to the back of the queue. For too many women where they live determines whether they live or die, she says. Hunt says he recognises what Nandy is saying. He says additional resources will have to be found to ensure people are not disadvantaged. Hunt says anyone is free to call the helpline number. It will be published today. Letters should be sent out to women affected over the next four weeks. Women who do not get letters should be pretty confident they have not been affected, he says. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative and a doctor, asks what women who are worried about this news should do. Hunt says all women who should be scanned, or who might want to get a scan, will be offered on. He says this will happen before October. But in most cases people should get scans much earlier, he says. Here is an extract from Jeremy Hunt’s statement to MPs. Earlier this year PHE [Public Health England] analysis of trial data from the service found that there was a computer algorithm failure dating back to 2009. The latest estimates I have received from PHE is that as a result of this, between 2009 and the start of 2018, an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening. At this stage it is not clear whether any delay in diagnosis resulted in any avoidable harm or death and that is one of the reasons I am ordering an independent review to establish the clinical impact. Our current best estimate which comes with caveats as it’s based on statistical modelling rather than patient reviews, and because there is currently no clinical consensus about the benefits of screening for this age group, is that there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result. I am advised that it is unlikely to be more than this range and may be considerably less. However, tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if the failure had not happened. Labour Paul Williams, a GP, asks if the update of screening of 68 to 71-year-olds during this period was less than expected. And, if so, why was that not investigated? Hunt says he will look into this. He does not know if there was a lower uptake. Normally the screening uptake rate is 80%, he says. Philippa Whitford, the SN’s health spokeswoman and a breast surgeon, says she is concerned about Hunt’s suggestion that, with older women, early diagnosis does not matter so much. She says early diagnosis is always important. She asks what efforts have been made to track down women affected. Hunt says he does not think he did say that you do not need to diagnose early. What he was saying was that, in many cases, early diagnosis will not make a difference. But diagnosis is always important, he says. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, says the woman affected need consistent, evidence-based guidance as to what they should do next. Hunt says the government has to be clear with patients that there is no medical consensus about the efficacy of screening for patients in the 70s. But anyone who wants a scan will get a scan, he says. Hunt says there is no consensus about the efficacy of breast cancer screening for older women. That is because older women are more likely to develop cancers, but those cancers are less likely to be life threatening, he says. Hunt says he wasnts to inform MPs of “a serious failure that has come to light” in the breast cancer screening programme. Some 2m women get screened every year, he says. Earlier this year it was found that a computer algorithm problem meant that between 2009 and the start of 2018 some 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final screening. Some 450,000 women missed a breast cancer screening, Hunt says. He says at this stage it is unclear whether any delay in diagnosis will have resulted in any avoidable or delay or death. He says the best estimate, based on modelling, is that there will be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result of this. There are unlikely to be more fatalities than that, and the number could be less, he says. There are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this failure had not happened. Up to 270 women may have died because they missed a screening, Hunt says. He says ministers were told about this in March. Public Health England advised that the public should not be told then, to allow time for remedial measures to be put in He says 309,000 of the 450,000 women who missed out are still alive. People will get clinical advise as to whether more screening is helpful. In some cases screening will be counter-productive. But he says patients will get a choice. Hunt says this covers England. Patients in Scotland and Wales are not thought to be affected. He says the government will contact thte next of kin of those who missed a scan and died of breast cancer. The government will try to establish if the missed scan was a factor. He says if it was, compensation will be paid. Compensation to be paid to families of women who died from cancer after missing a screening, Hunt says. He accepts these findings will be very disturbing for people. Some people will get a letter saying they missed out knowing they now have a terminal illness. He says he apologise wholeheartedly to those people for the suffering caused. He says there will be an independent review of the breast screening programme. Hunt announces independent inquiry into breast screening programme. He says he wants to be transparent about what went wrong. Jeremy Hunt is now making his statement about breast cancer screening. (See 11.56am.) Labour’s Gloria de Piero says an 83-year-old woman who had a fall at home in her constituency had to wait three hours for an ambulance. Will May apologise to her? May says she is sorry to hear about that. She will look into it. Nicky Morgan, a Conservative, says the Treasury committee, which she chairs, will take evidence from TSB later about its IT failure. Does May agree that robust IT is vital for banking? May says banks should have robust and stable IT systems. Marcus Jones, a Conservative, says council tax rates doubled under Labour. Doesn’t this show the government was right to cap council tax increases? May agrees. She says Conservative councils have been freezing or cutting council tax. Conservative councils on average cost families £100 less in council tax, she says. The SNP’s Chris Stephens asks about the pay rise for civil servants. Doesn’t it amount to a real-terms pay cut? May says the 1% cap on public sector pay rises has been abandoned. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks about the 464 survivors of thalidomide. Will May ask the Foreign Office to intervene with Germany, which has gone back on a compensation promise. (The drug was developed in Germany.) May says the Foreign Office is pursuing this. Labour’s Paula Sherriff asks why the government has not appointed an equalities champion to ensure BAME people get access to better mental health provision. May says it was precisely to address issues like this that she launched the racial disparities audit. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says the European scrutiny committee that he chairs has repeatedly asked her chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, to appear. But he won’t. Will May ensure that he does give evidence? May says she will look into this. Labour’s Karen Buck asks why the government is still considering two EU customs options that are seen as unworkable. May says if Buck is so interested in this, she should asks the Labour front bench to decide its own policy on it. Labour’s Jo Stevens asks May if she agrees with Sajid Javid about the “hostile environment” not representing British values. May says she agrees with what Javid said about the importance of differentiating between legal immigration and illegal immigration. She says he was referring to a phrase. But it was a phrase first used by Labour. Amber Rudd, who resigned as home secretary on Sunday night, starts by congratulating Sajid Javid on his appointment. She says the UK threat level remains at severe. Last year five terrorist attacks got through. Will May share with her her admiration for the work of the security services? May says she is pleased to be able to pay tribute to Rudd for the work she did as home secretary. She says Rudd’s work with internet companies was ground breaking. And she says she agrees with what Rudd said about the work of the intelligence agencies and emergency services. (That exchange is a fairly clear sign that Rudd will not be joining the pro-European Tory rebels.) PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn’t really a PMQs at all; we just had two PPBs (party political broadcasts) blaring away in tandem, doing little to enlighten anyone. Corbyn’s PPB was better on passion, and it covered wider ground - in fact, there was little area of public policy where he failed to castigate the government - but May probably did better on specific, memorable detail (her Hazelbourne Road anecdote). The local elections take place tomorrow, and so perhaps this wasn’t surprising. Corbyn did start with a neat, sassy question about Windrush. But May’s announcement about an inquiry into what went wrong disarmed him, and also helped to explain why the Tory whips feel comfortable about ordering their MPs to vote against the Labour motion calling for all confidential government paperwork on Windrush to be disclosed later this afternoon. The government clearly feels that this will be enough to contain demands for the full disclosure of documents, although the inquiry she announced sounded very minimalist. She described it as a “full review of lessons learned” rather than a proper inquiry, and it does not sound as if it will be especially independent. (She talked about “independent oversight and external challenge”, which is not quite the same as having an independent person in charge.) It will also concluded before the end of July, which means it may be one of the shortest inquiries on record. Corbyn says the education secretary has been corrected by the UK Statistics Authority. It says budgets are being cut. Yet May is in denial. And police budgets are an issue too. Home Office civil servants says there is a link between budget cuts and increased crime. May says she has protected police budgets. That is not what Andy Burnham proposed when he was shadow home secretary. She says the shadow home affairs minister has said there is no relationship between police numbers and crime figures. Corbyn says the shadow police minister was pointing to a cut in police budgets. Some 21,000 police officers have lost their jobs since 2010. Violent crime is rising. Deaths from knife crime are going up, especially in London. The government is making a complete shambles of Brexit, damaging the NHS, damaging schools, and yet they claim to be strong and stable. With council tax rising by more than 5% all over the country, isn’t the truth that with the Tories you pay more and get less. May says there is more funding going into the NHS, schools and social care. If Corbyn wants to talk about council tax, he should go to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side houses in Labour Lambeth people pay very high council tax. On the other side, in Conservative Wandworth, people pay much less. That shows people pay less under the Conservatives. Corbyn offers facts about the inquiry. There are more people in debt, more people using food banks, more people in debt and more people in poverty. The NHS is suffering the longest funding squeeze in history. Will May apologise for this? May says there are more people in work, and fewer people in absolute poverty. She says the chancellor has announced £10bn extra for the NHS. She is conducting a review to find a long-term plan. That is the sensible approach to take. It is about funding and reform. Corbyn says March was the worst month on record for A&amp;E. It was also the worst month for cancelled operation. There are thousands of vacancies for NHS staff. But May intervened personally to stop the NHS hiring from abroad. He says the education secretary used to say there would be no cut in schools funding. Last week he refused to repeat that pledge. Will May admit schools budgets are being cut? May says there is more money for schools. It is not just a question of how much money you put in. She says 1.9m children are in outstanding schools under this government. Jeremy Corbyn also pays tribute to Michael Martin. They first met when they were both organisers for the NUPE union in the 1970s. Did the PM feel the slightest pang of guilt when Amber Rudd was forced to resign due to the actions of her predecessor? May says she will start by updating MPs on Windrush issues. Sajid Javid will address MPs on this later today. He will announce a package of measures to bring transparency on this issue. She says speed of of the essence. She says there will be a review of lessons learnt. It will report before the summer and will have full access to all papers. May announces review into what went wrong with Windrush scandal, to report before summer. May says the government needs to build more homes. The housing infrastructure fund helps. Theresa May starts by offering condolences to the family and friends of Michael Martin, the former speaker who has died. She pays tribute to his courtesy in particular. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP, asks about upskirting. It is not a specific offence. She has worked on a bill to make it a specific crime. Will May back changing the law on this. May says she agrees. She shares the outrage at this intrusive behaviour. The government wants to ensure victims’ complaints are taken seriously. The justice secretary will consider Hobhouse’s proposed law change. PMQs is about to start. This is from Chris Smyth, health editor at the Times. This is from the Telegraph’s Kate McCann. Jeremy Hunt is making a statement to MPs after PMQs. This is from the BBC’s diplomatic editor, James Landale. And here is a reply from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. The 30-page memo circulated by the European Research Group criticising the customs partnership proposal (see 9.33am) lists nine objects to the proposal. Here they are: 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates. 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates, because firms would be under a range of requirements to prove they are entitled to receive the relevant tariff rebates. 2 - Exporters to the UK would need their customers in the UK to pay EU tariffs, then try to claim them back by proving that the goods had gone to a UK end-consumer. 3 - Our trade partners would be deterred from agreeing mutual tariff reductions by their having to pay EU tariff rates up front. 4 - The UK would have less negotiating leverage over a potential trade partner’s trade barriers and behind the border regulatory barriers. 5 - EU quotas make the problem yet more complex. 6 - Only large corporates would be able to carry the significant administrative burdens of this system. 7 - Crucially, this option also frustrates UK regulatory independence. 8 - If the above factors mean that uptake of the rebate scheme is low, this would mean that the tariffs levied in practice on goods entering the UK market could be higher than the UK’s bound rate, which would be a violation of the GATT. 9 - The UK would continue to be a substantial tax collector for the EU, continuing to make a substantial net contribution to the EU budget. And here is an extract from the conclusion. The NCP proposed is undeliverable in operational terms and would require a degree of regulatory alignment that would make the execution of an independent trade policy a practical impossibility. This covers not only our external trade agenda but our own control over UK regulation and whether we can improve it. Economists have recently described a “new normal” of limited global growth, potentially secular global stagnation. This can be avoided by a group of countries committing to reduce the distortions found in anticompetitive regulation. For example, a 20% reduction in distortions in the TPP 11, plus the UK and US, over 15 years could yield approximately an added 0.5% into global GDP year-on-year (c.$2 trillion over the period), according to some estimates. Set against this, customs clearance costs are small. (It should be noted that the estimates of the impact of behind the border barrier reduction are conservative, ignoring distortion reductions elsewhere, for example in China, that this approach may yield, nor do they assume any interaction effects.) Any form of the customs arrangements above would mean continuing curtailment of UK capacity for independent trade and self-government, plus ECJ jurisdiction, applying harmonised rules and regulations across the domestic UK economy; they also mean external tariffs and abiding by future changes, but without a vote. Turning back to the customs partnership, these are from the BBC’s Norman Smith. The “hybrid model” is the customs partnership, the proposal that Tory Brexiters are opposing. See 9.54am. “Max fac” is the other one. Dominic Raab is the Brexiter housing minister. UPDATE: Here is the Raab quote. He was speaking to Radio 5 Live. I always keep an open mind on this, because I do think when it comes to Brexit, we’re going to be forging a distinct path for the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect, actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union, but also avoid the hard border, as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment, the way I read it, is that those in favour of ‘max fac’ are winning the argument. But I don’t want to prejudice the debate cabinet should have and must have in order to hammer this out. If you look at the roll-on, roll-off ports, the pre-arrival notification of goods and customs declarations, if you look at the option of having authorised economic operators, and all of the stuff that has already been tried and tested on the US/Canada border, or on the Australia/New Zealand border, I think it [maximum facilitation] is actually the one that’s been tried and tested the most. Labour has accused the government of a cover up and of shedding “crocodile tears” over Windrush in the light of its decision to whip its MPs to vote against the opposition day motion. A Labour spokesperson said: If the architect of this cruel farce, the prime minister, is ordering her MPs to vote to keep her role in this mess hidden from the public, it exposes the Tories’ crocodile tears on the Windrush scandal as a sham. We need answers, not further cover ups to save Theresa May from facing up to her involvement in the removal of rights, detentions and possible deportations of British citizens. After letting Rudd take the fall for her decisions, how can the public have any trust in the prime minister? We are likely to hear much more of this at PMQs in an hour’s time. Conservative MPs are being whipped to vote against the Labour opposition day motion saying the government should publish papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now, we’ve been told. That means there will be a vote at 7pm. Until now the government has tended not to vote against opposition day motions. Generally they are not binding on the government, and ministers found it easier to ignore motions they did not like than to run the risk of staging a vote and losing. That led to the Labour party using their opposition days to table “humble address” motions demanding the release of particular government papers to select committees. These motions, which used to be used very rarely, are binding on the government. Last year there were motions ordering the release of the government’s Brexit impact assessments and of universal credit project assessments. Both were passed without opposition because the government did not order its MPs to vote against. Today the whips are taking a different approach and are instructing their MPs to vote against the Labour motion. Why? Presumably because they are reasonably confident of winning. The Labour motion is very wide-ranging, because it requires all internal government documents, including emails and text messages, relating to Windrush-related policy decisions to be handed over to the Commons home affairs committee (which would then be free to publish the material). Many MPs might argue that that is unreasonable, because even under the Freedom of Information Act there is an acceptance that government decision making is protected by some degree of confidentiality. But the key point is that the motion seems to have been drafted with the express intent of uncovering material likely to embarrass Theresa May and establish her culpability in the Windrush affair. Many Tory MPs are embarrassed about Windrush, but at some point tribal loyalty kicks in and they would have to feel very strongly about this to vote for something so nakedly hostile to their party leader. So the Tories may well win. But it won’t look good, because it will look like a cover-up. For reference, here is the wording of the motion in full. That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be provided to the home affairs committee: all papers, correspondence and advice including emails and text messages, from 11 May 2010 up to and including 1 May 2018, to and between ministers, senior officials and special advisers relating to policy decisions including on the Immigration Acts 2014 and 2016 with regard the Windrush generation cases, including deportations, detentions and refusal of re-entry, the setting of deportation and removal targets and their effect on the Windrush generation, and action taken within government following the concerns raised by Caribbean governments with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office including the original decision by the prime minister not to meet Caribbean heads of government and officials, and all copies of minutes and papers relating to the cabinet’s immigration implementation taskforce. In his interview on the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, confirmed what the Guardian reported overnight - that today’s meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee is not expected to take a decision today as to whether the “customs partnership” or the alternative “highly streamlined customs arrangement” (which is now being referred to as “maximum facilitation”, or “max fac”, in Whitehall). He said the committee’s discussions would “start this afternoon and will probably continue in other meetings”. He went on: This will be the first time today for cabinet colleagues to sit down and have a constructive discussion about the way forward. I expect we will come to a decision on this, as well as on other important elements of our negotiating position, over the next few weeks. For reference, this is what the government’s future partnership paper (pdf) on customs published last summer said about the two options. The government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt to meet these objectives. These approaches represent different choices about the nature of our relationship with the EU and countries around the world, but in either option the UK would seek to pursue its independent trade policy objectives. A highly streamlined customs arrangement between the UK and the EU, streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible. This would aim to: continue some of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU; put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. This approach involves utilising the UK’s existing tried and trusted third country processes for UK-EU trade, building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible. A new customs partnership with the EU, aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU’s requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU. This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU. Theresa May has opened talks with Brussels on the UK’s future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But any negotiation with Michel Barnier can’t really match, in terms of the strength of passion engaged, or the risk it poses to her own premiership, the negotiation she is having to conduct simultaneously with her own backbenchers. And today that negotiation has hit a crisis point. The European Research Group (ERG), which is led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and represents around 50 Tory backbenchers committed to a harder form of Brexit, has sent her a long report arguing that the “customs partnership” proposals - one of the government’s two post-Brexit customs options for when the UK leaves the EU, and one that May is reluctant to drop - is unacceptable. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail are both leading with the story. One of the peculiarities of this is that, when the government first floated the customs partnership idea in a policy paper last summer (pdf), the Brexiters did not complain about it at all. But now, in leave circles, it is being vilified as being almost equivalent to remaining in the EU. Here is an extract from the Telegraph splash (paywall). One ERG source said: “We have swallowed everything so far – but this is it. If they don’t have confidence in Brexit we don’t have confidence in them. The prime minister will not have a majority if she does not kill off the NCP [New Customs Partnership].” Mr Rees-Mogg added: “The customs partnership is incompatible with the Conservative party manifesto.” A copy of the report, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, dismantles the argument for a customs partnership which Brexiteers fear will keep Britain effectively in a customs union with the European Union after the UK leaves in March next year. Rees-Mogg got the 8.10am slot on the Today programme to discuss this further (a sign of the influence he exerts on the government - David Lidington, who is supposedly May’s effective deputy prime minister, was relegated to the less prestigious 8.40 slot). And Rees-Mogg insisted that the the ERG were not threatening to bring down the prime minister over this. There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market. At this point he sounded not entirely unlike someone running a protection racket. “Very nice majority you’ve got here, prime minister. Great shame if anything were to happen to it.” Later he claimed that the ERG was actually doing May a favour. When it was put to him that his stance was damaging her negotiating position, he replied: I don’t think it does, actually, because there is no point in negotiating with something that the other side think is magical thinking. The sooner the government gets away from this customs partnership, the easier it will be to get onto a negotiating that might actually happen. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons education committee as chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. 11.50am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, gives a speech to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation industrial strategy conference. 10.45am: The Metropolitan Police and the National Crime Agency give evidence to the Lords EU home affairs sub committee on the proposed UK-EU security treaty. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion intended to force the government to publish all papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now. After 3.30pm: Peers resume their debate on the EU withdrawal bill. They are expected to vote on an amendment tabled by the Conservative peer Chris Patten that would stop the government agreeing a Brexit deal that created a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

          "headline": "Up to 270 women may have died after breast cancer screening IT error",
          "bodyText": "Women’s lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. As many as 270 women may have died because of the 2009 computer error, he said. Families now face the distressing possibility that loved ones who have recently died from breast cancer may have missed opportunities for early diagnosis. Women receiving breast cancer treatment, including those with a terminal diagnosis, may also receive letters informing them of missed screenings in the coming months. The government has ordered an independent inquiry into the scandal, which Public Health England (PHE) only unearthed in January after almost a decade of errors, Hunt said. He said between 135 and 270 women “may have had their lives shortened as a result” of the missed letters, which were due to be sent out automatically to older women registered with their GPs. He said the numbers may be considerably lower, but that statistical modelling suggested there were “likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this had not happened”. Hunt told the House of Commons that because of a computer algorithm failure an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening between 2009 and the start of 2018. He said the error was a serious failure of the screening programme. He apologised “wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the suffering caused”, and said: “Tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this failure had not happened.” Of the women who missed screenings, 309,000 were still alive and would be contacted before the end of May, and the first 65,000 notifications would be sent out this week, Hunt said. The letters will tell women under 72 that they will automatically be sent an invitation for a catchup screening, and those 72 and over will be given access to a helpline to decide whether a screening is appropriate, he said. Hunt said his department would contact the families of women who had died of breast cancer and who believed they had missed a screening, to apologise, and offer a process to establish whether the missed scan led to shortening of their life. “We recognise this will be incredibly distressing for some families,” he said. Family members would have their concerns investigated and compensation may be payable if the error is found to have led to an earlier death, he said. The regular screenings offered to women who are most at risk of developing the disease mean signs of early cancer development can be picked up before women notice the symptoms. Many families will be “deeply disturbed by these revelations,” Hunt said, especially those recently diagnosed with breast cancer or those who were recently bereaved. “For them and others, it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation to screening at a correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence.” The issue came to light because of an upgrade to the IT system for the breast screening invitation programme. Dr Jenny Harries, PHE’s deputy medical director, said the body was “very sorry for these faults in the system”. She said: “We have carried out urgent work to identify the problem and have fixed it. Additional failsafe systems have been introduced to ensure the problem does not reoccur,.” The problem was identified during a review of the progress of a major NHS trial designed to find out whether extra screening would protect older women from breast cancer. Set up in 2009, the AgeX trial now runs in 65 breast cancer units across England. After it was noticed that women in the trial had not been invited for their final routine screenings before their 70th birthday, it emerged that this had also happened to women in the routine NHS breast screening programme, affecting an estimated 450,000 women, according to Public Health England. The inquiry is likely to raise questions for Labour, under whom the IT errors occurred, as well as for the Conservatives as to why the glitch was not picked up sooner. Hunt said the inquiry would establish how many people were affected, why the error occurred and how it could be prevented in future. It will also examine why it took nearly a decade to pick up the problem and whether ministers were informed early enough. The inquiry will be chaired by Lynda Thomas, the chief executive of Macmillan cancer support and Prof Martin Gore, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden. It will review the entire breast screening programme and report back in six months. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Hunt must give assurances that checks were being carried out to make sure that no one was missing out on screenings for other cancers. “Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected,” he said, adding that ministers must investigate whether early warning signs were missed. Labour MP Lisa Nandy said she had concerns about whether overstretched NHS screening services would be able to meet the extra demand. Hunt said new resources would be found where scans and treatment were needed “to make sure other people are not disadvantaged”. It is unclear whether those resources would require extra funding. A government spokesman said it had delayed making the errors public in order to make sure resources were in place to cope with a spike in demand. The Royal College of Radiologists said the catch-up test would place considerable strain on screening units already stretched. “Ultimately, we need funding for more training posts for radiologists to ensure the screening programme – and the NHS as a whole – has the vital imaging doctors it needs,” said Caroline Rubin, its vice-president. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, also said she was shocked by the implications of the error, saying more than 18,000 cancers were detected as a result of the breast screening programme which might not have been detected as early otherwise. Stokes-Lampard said it was vital there were “enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and steps taken to ensure this never happens again.” Cancer charities expressed deep concern about the revelations. The chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, Delyth Morgan, said it was beyond belief that the error continued for almost a decade, calling it a “colossal systematic failure”. Cancer Research UK Emma Greenwood said they were “very concerning”. This article was amended on 6 May 2018 to clarify details of the problem in the NHS breast screening programme."

          "headline": "Are Democrats finally ready to unfriend Facebook and Silicon Valley?",
          "bodyText": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington a few weeks ago to absorb the wrath of a Congress angered by the way his company allowed the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal data of millions of unsuspecting Facebook users. A few members of Congress understood that the outrage was even greater: that Zuckerberg’s company basically exists in order to spy on us. That it tracks us as we wander online. That it controls the news users see. That it buys up competitors and operates as a near monopoly. That this panopticon corporation (whose services I myself use every day) has more power – political power, cultural power – than any private entity ought to have. As Zephyr Teachout put it, the company is “a danger to democracy”. Understanding this, some in Congress were pretty tough on Zuckerberg. But watching him squirm under the Washington glare reminded me of a different conversation between the young billionaire and an elected official, one that took place in the summer of 2016, back when a sunnier conception of Facebook was mandatory among America’s enlightened class. The setting was the state department’s annual “Global Entrepreneurship Summit”, the elected official was President Barack Obama, and the object seems to have been to deliver a thinly disguised advertisement for Facebook as a lovable facilitator of basic human relationships. Seated with a panel of entrepreneurs from around the world, the president lobbed his friend Zuckerberg an easy question about Facebook “creating this platform for entrepreneurship around the world”. In batting it out of the park, the Facebook CEO, clad in his humble costume of jeans, T-shirt and sneakers, took pains to inform everyone that what animated him were high-minded ideals. “When I was getting started,” he burbled, “I cared deeply about giving everyone a voice, and giving people the tools to share everything that they cared about, and bringing a community together …” No rude senator spoke up to interrupt this propaganda. Instead, Zuckerberg went on to describe his efforts to connect everyone to the internet as a sort of wager on human goodness itself. “It’s this deep belief that you’re trying to make a change, you’re trying to connect people in the world, and I really do believe that if you do something good and if you help people out, then eventually some portion of that good will come back to you. And you may not know up front what it’s going to be, but that’s just been the guiding principle for me in the work that we’ve done …” That’s how it works, all right. Gigantic corporate investments are acts of generosity, and when making them, kind-hearted CEOs routinely count on Karma to reward them. That’s the “guiding principle”. Reader, here is what the president could be heard to say as Zuckerberg ended this self-serving homily: “Excellent.” I bring all this up not to ding Obama participating in a corporate whitewash, but to remind liberals and Democrats that, until very recently, this was who we liberals were. We drank the Kool-Aid. We believed the hype. Facebook wasn’t a “danger to democracy”, we thought. Facebook was democracy. Do you remember? The 2008 campaign, which elevated Obama to the White House, was described by the enlightened as “the Facebook election”. We had seen a community organizer, ably assisted by a Facebook co-founder, win the presidency by organizing communities – by organizing them online! The combination of idealistic togetherness and awesome futurific-ness was thought to be too much for those plodding, selfish Republicans. Obama’s state department, led by Hillary Clinton, became the country’s main institutional proponent of the thesis that, wherever the internet went, there also went markets, and entrepreneurship, and liberation. Clinton called the state department’s new mission “internet freedom” (she introduced the idea in a speech given, ironically, at a museum of journalism); she intended to take what she called a “venture capital approach” to the problem of overcoming state censorship and battling the tyrants of the world. I was exposed unforgettably to liberal techno-optimism at a Clinton Foundation event in March 2015, when I heard a speaker hail social media as the ally and liberator of the female population of the entire planet. Or think of the way Obama surrounded himself with transplanted Silicon Valley types in the last years of his administration; or of Clinton’s 2016 campaign, run by an algorithm; or of Clinton’s rumored intention to make Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s No2, her treasury secretary. But then the narrative went all wrong. Instead of overthrowing unsavory regimes in the Middle East, the internet overthrew its high-minded comrades in the Democratic party. It turned out that even an obtuse cad like Donald Trump could tweet. Errant emails caused countless headaches. Mean Russian trolls published crazy things on Facebook. And finally … Cambridge Analytica, harvesting people’s personal data. What an ingrate the internet has turned out to be. Today the Democratic party stands at the crossroads, and I hope the awful experience of 2016 will at least make them think twice before they resume their devotions in the First Church of Silicon Valley. Maybe they are finally ready to think a little harder about what democracy means. To stand up, at long last, for we the surveilled. Thomas Frank is a columnist for the Guardian US"

          "headline": "Foreign Office officials met Cambridge Analytica over Trump",
          "bodyText": "Foreign Office officials met Cambridge Analytica executives to “better understand” the secrets behind Donald Trump’s presidential victory, the Observer has learned, raising new questions over the extent of links between the government and the controversial data firm. Officials from London, Washington and New York met Cambridge Analytica representatives in a series of meetings aimed at acquiring insights into the “political environment” that followed Trump’s shock win. Details of the meetings, revealed in response to a freedom of information request, show the government hoped it would help “build relationships with the Trump campaign and transition team”, and they took place as the Conservative party was desperately seeking contacts within the incoming US administration. The FoI response also shows the relationship between the Foreign Office (FCO) and the data firm extended to government contracts, with the FCO, under a Labour government, paying more than £400,000 to Strategic Communications Laboratories, the former name of SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, for a project to help tackle extremism. The contract, worth £402,501, was signed in 2008 to provide research and surveys into public opinion as part of an initiative to help Pakistan deal with extremism and radicalisation issues that could affect the UK. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s leader in Westminster, said the extent of the relationship between the government, SCL and Cambridge Analytica needed to be made public. “The FCO’s dealings with Cambridge Analytica and the £400,000 given to SCL is an alarming revelation, and raises further questions about the government’s dealings with these companies. How many other departments have had such relations with SCL and CA?” Blackford also revealed that he had forwarded questions to Theresa May about links between the Conservative party and Cambridge Analytica, currently under investigation by the information commissioner over the huge leak of Facebook data, but had not received an answer. The company used personal information harvested from more than 50 million Facebook profiles to target US voters with personalised political advertisements. So far it has been established that SCL was granted provisional “List X” status by the Ministry of Defence until 2013, giving it access to secret documents. The MoD praised SCL for the training it provided to a psychological operations warfare group with an official stating it would “have no hesitation in inviting SCL to tender for further contracts of this nature”. The meetings between the Foreign Office and Cambridge Analytica appear to have been at a time May’s government was looking to foster relationships with Trump’s team, with the prime minister having been left embarrassed after Nigel Farage became the first British politician to meet the president following his victory in November 2016. The revelations also follow recent details of a previously undisclosedmeeting in December 2016 between Boris Johnson and Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s suspended chief executive. Reports documenting the meeting suggest Johnson was not hoping to gain details of the algorithm that helped Trump to victory but improve links with the president. Blackford has previously raised questions about links between the Tories and SCL’s chairman Julian Wheatland. In April 2015 Wheatland, also chairman of Oxford Conservative Association, tweeted a selfie with the then prime minister David Cameron."

          "headline": "Who ruined San Francisco? How its scooter wars sparked a blame game",
          "bodyText": "The cold war between San Francisco and the tech industry erupted into open hostilities again this month, when the overnight arrival of hundreds of motorized scooters across the city’s streetscape reignited tensions between the techies and the tech-nots. The dockless electric scooters, which were distributed around San Francisco by three competing startups just as the city was preparing to pass legislation to regulate them, have become the latest symbol of competing visions for city living. To critics of the tech industry, they represent everything that is wrong with the “move fast and break things” ethos. To tech evangelists, they are further proof that it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission. But in a city whose streets are often littered with the symptoms of a housing affordability crisis and gaping wealth inequality – homeless encampments, human waste and discarded needles are impossible for the affluent to ignore – the scooter wars have evolved into a contentious debate over who is most to blame for making San Francisco so unlivable and who should be trusted to fix it. “Why is it that we can have emergency action on scooters but we have needles on the sidewalk?” asked Sam Altman, president of the startup incubator Y Combinator. “The existing civic institutions that are supposed to make life better and more affordable and easier in the city have not done a good job.” Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former Facebook product manager who has lived in San Francisco on and off for 20 years, expressed a similar sentiment on Twitter, where he described the city’s response to “streets covered in human shit, drug needles, and broken glass from an epidemic of property crime” as “meh”, while its response to “startups us[ing] private money for a citywide experiment in personal mobility” was “THIS OUTRAGE CANNOT STAND”. When another user pointed out that the city spends hundreds of millions of dollars on services for the homeless and police, Martinez shot back: “In Silicon Valley we like to measure performance via outputs, not inputs.” A year after tech’s favorite bad bro, Travis Kalanick, was ousted from his perch atop Uber, it’s no longer de rigueur for tech entrepreneurs to flash their wealth around or offer products designed exclusively to solve the problems plaguing the 1%. Instead, startups are making the case for their existence using the language of Bay Area liberalism. “Not everyone can afford their own electric scooter,” Travis VanderZanden, the ex-Uber executive and current CEO of the scooter startup Bird, told the New York Times. “We shouldn’t discriminate against people that are renting versus owning.” Altman, too, cast the scooter companies as a necessary corrective to the high cost of living in San Francisco. “We have an affordability crisis beyond anything I’d imagined, and when people see a startup that is trying to help people afford to live farther out, and it would really help people, and then they see that get taken away, I think people respond very badly,” he said. Of course, the other side of the debate also claims the moral high ground. Advocacy groups for pedestrians, seniors and disabled people turned out in force at a city hearing to speak about the importance of keeping sidewalks clear for vulnerable populations. And anti-gentrification and affordable housing activists have long harbored animosity toward the affluent tech workers displacing lower-income renters from the city’s limited housing stock. “Sometimes a thing like a scooter or a bus becomes a symbol of something that people feel, and the feeling right now in the Bay Area is that it’s becoming a playground for wealthy tech companies at the expense of the majority of us,” said the local activist Max Alper. “The problem is when we have a system that is built for the enjoyment of the few while public transportation and public good is being cut.” Alper participated in the first Google bus blockade, in December 2013, where he impersonated a tech worker in an act of “political theater” that was captured on video. His performance of entitlement – shouting “This is a city for the right people who can afford it” – was not actually that far-fetched. In 2016, a startup entrepreneur published an open letter to the mayor that read in part: “The wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city … I shouldn’t have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day.” Alper has adopted a small act of protest against the scooters, which he explained by saying: “When I was growing up my mom always told me that if there is trash in public, that’s it’s all of our responsibility to clean it up.” He’s not the only person to move a scooter out of the sidewalk and into a garbage bin. Others have thrown unattended scooters into trees or the San Francisco Bay or vandalized them with profane stickers – “Hey dumb fuck get off the sidewalk” – and even feces. Liz Henry, a disabled longtime San Francisco resident and senior release manager at Mozilla, expressed some frustration at “people invoking disability and poverty as reasons not to do the scooters”. A co-founder of the first women’s hackerspace in San Francisco, Henry also was understanding of the mindset that leads tech entrepreneurs to behave in the way they do, which she described as a “mentality of approaching social problems as well as technical problems by just trying things out, seeing the possibilities, rapidly trying and discarding solutions”. Still, she acknowledged, when techies try to iterate in the real world, “it doesn’t necessarily come out the same way as if it’s software” because the negative outcomes aren’t just buggy code. To Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor who introduced the scooter legislation, the idea that the city government is neglecting its other responsibilities to attack a startup is absurd. “My colleagues and I can rub our bellies and pat our heads at the same time,” he said. Peskin said that, despite the current flare-up, relations between tech companies and the city have actually been better in recent months, and that the resources expended on serious social issues like homelessness and street cleaning exceed those spent on scooter regulation by “a factor of thousands to one”. And Peskin is not particularly persuaded by the idea that the tech world can or should come up with better ideas to solve San Francisco’s many challenges. “Poverty and inequity don’t get solved by an algorithm. They got solved by sharing,” he said."

          "headline": "From Game of Thrones to The Crown: the woman who turns actors into stars",
          "bodyText": "Earlier this year, the casting director Nina Gold sat at the back of the stalls of the Criterion theatre in the West End and watched a group of students from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland perform their showcase. After three years at drama school, each actor had a couple of three-minute scenes to impress a silent audience of agents and casting directors on their lunch hour. Gold slid down in her seat, as if wanting to remain unseen. Every now and then, she scribbled something next to a name in her programme, drew a circle around a face. At the end, Gold bolted through the foyer, past piles of photographs of the students laid out like market wares, and drove vigorously across London in her tiny electric car. “How the fuck do they do it?” she said. “You look at those kids, even the ones who weren’t that brilliant, and they were really giving it their all, weren’t they? They had to get up there. I mean, can you imagine?” Over 30-odd years, Gold has become the most powerful casting director in the UK, her taste shaping everything from Game of Thrones to Bridget Jones’s Baby, yet she can still be mystified by what actors do and why they do it. Back in her office, which occupies the front room of her large Edwardian house in north-west London, Gold and her assistant Martin Ware discussed the showcase. “I liked his face,” said Ware, pointing in the programme at a young blond actor named Elliot Baxter. “I thought he could be a good Chernobylly-type soldier.” “Yes!” said Gold. “I thought he could be a Chernobylly type too.” Gold was midway through working on an epic Sky-HBO five-parter called Chernobyl, about the 1986 nuclear disaster, which had more than 100 speaking parts. (“Whoops,” the screenwriter Craig Mazin told me, “these things pile up.”) Gold had been casting it since last September and it was due to start filming in April. Although she had already confirmed the actors Jared Harris, Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgård for the three lead roles, there were still plenty of unfilled parts. The exact number kept changing – 102 one week, 109 the next – as the script was still being revised. Gold and Robert Sterne, with whom she was casting the show, were hunting for mostly British actors who could convincingly play 1980s Soviet soldiers and firemen facing near-certain death by exposure to radiation. So far, most had been too chatty, too gestural, too cheerful. Chernobyl was one of many tasks that required attention. Gold was also firming up who would play Prince Philip in the third series of The Crown, calling in actors to audition for a movie about Nell Gwynn, casting a remake of Shogun, and starting work on the next Star Wars instalment, for which she kept being summoned to secretive meetings at Pinewood Studios. Sitting by her desk, which has two drawers, one labelled “home/family/personal” and the other “CASTING”, Gold tried to count how many projects she was working on. “It would be the end of my career if I admit I’m doing eight at once,” she said, serious and entirely unserious at the same time, a typical mode. “Let’s say six … Maybe we should just say four. One at a time!” She paused. “Things stagger around in an annoying manner.” There was a moment, somewhere in the nexus between Game of Thrones and The Crown, where it felt as if Gold’s name was gliding through the credits of every high-end show on TV. Her 167 credits include many grand British success stories – The King’s Speech, The Theory of Everything, the Paddington movies and every Mike Leigh film since Topsy-Turvy. But in the past few years, she has ascended into Hollywood’s mega-franchise league (the Star Wars saga, sequels to Jurassic World and Mamma Mia!). Gold is partly responsible for the impression that British actors have colonised Hollywood, sneaking unknown young pretenders, John Boyega and Daisy Ridley, into Star Wars, and concealing Gwendoline Christie beneath a silver helmet as a stormtrooper commander. In a business that runs on the currency of name, hers now has demonstrable value, able to attract talent and money. In the opening credits of one recent film – On Chesil Beach – “NINA GOLD” arrived, alone and vast across the Dorset coastline filling the screen, shortly after the lead actors. Faye Ward, producer of Jane Eyre and Suffragette, told me: “You get Nina Gold on a script and people are like wow, it must be good.” “She’s a legend in her own right,” said Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, which makes Star Wars. Back at their desks, Gold and Ware were eager to make calls. “Shall we get him in?” said Ware, about the young actor, Baxter. “Yes!” said Gold, gripped by sudden enthusiasm. Ware pointed at the programme again. “And do you think she could be a nurse?” “We could try, couldn’t we?” Ware left voicemails. “This is Nina Gold’s office calling … ” * * * Done right, casting is an invisible act. The choice of an actor should seem obvious in retrospect. No one but Eddie Redmayne could have played Stephen Hawking. No one but Claire Foy could have played the young Queen. Gold’s industry peers liken the way she does her job to the practice of an alchemist, a snake charmer, a card sharp, as if she were performing some kind of shadowy magic. “Her fingerprints are on so many movies,” said Ian McEwan, the author and screenwriter of On Chesil Beach. Peter Morgan, the creator of The Crown, described her as a benevolent pickpocket. “You walk in and you have a pocketful of what you think are brilliant ideas,” he said. “By the time you leave you have none of those ideas any more and your pockets have been replaced with other stuff which you then find out is inevitably better.” Casting directors never have the final say on who gets what part – that privilege goes to the showrunner in television and the director and producers in film. Instead their art involves delicate persuasion, applying pressure without appearing to do so. “We have to stop people casting the wrong people,” said Gold. “We have to try and get them to make the right choices without bossing them around. It’s quite difficult.” She paused. “This morning I found myself on the phone saying maybe I just don’t care and you should cast the wrong person to play Prince Philip. Maybe I just don’t fucking care … But then you realise you would be really shit at your job if you just let them have what they want.” Gold spends a lot of time working with creative visionaries, which also means that she spends a lot of time working with congenitally insecure narcissists. One morning she told me about meeting an eminent actor at a dinner the night before, whose opening line to Gold was: “Why never me?” (“I was like: ‘Oh fucking hell.’”) She collaborates with people for whom losing their shit is an essential part of the job, who have a tenuous grasp of the truth, who exist in what McEwan refers to as the constant state of “controlled panic” that is film-making. Mad bullies abound. She has worked with Harvey Weinstein. “I mean, I definitely had the sense of him being a disgusting old sleazebag. But just as a feeling. Nothing concrete.” How does she deal with them all? “God, I don’t know. I think I go quiet.” If you have a received notion of what a casting director might be like – brassy, formidable, yelling “next!” – then reverse this and you will get closer to Gold. She is 52, looks younger – perhaps thanks to a fierce yoga regime with a Scottish guru in Marylebone – has an asymmetrical, dark blast of unruly hair and multiple ear piercings. In conversation, she tends towards flippancy that disguises a pitiless work ethic. She also has a contagious enthusiasm for swearing, expletives rushing forth in a gentle voice often undercut by doubt. Many of her sentences begin: “I don’t know”; many emails start: “SORRY!” Gold started casting while still at Cambridge University, where she studied French and Latin. A friend in London asked her to be an extra in a Feargal Sharkey video, and then to recruit some twentysomethings in leather jackets for an AC/DC video. The friend left the job and Gold kept going, casting music videos and commercials. In 1992, she cast a McDonald’s advert directed by Mike Leigh (the one when the kid goes to get a Big Mac and comes back to find his granny playing his Game Boy). Both had issues with taking the job. Gold had to talk round her Greenpeace activist partner, Frank Hewetson, and Leigh had to get a queasy blessing from Ken Loach (“If you don’t take the money off these capitalists, somebody else will”). But a few years later, Leigh gave Gold her break, bringing her in to help him cast Topsy-Turvy, her first major film. “She has an uncanny ability to get it,” he told me. “To differentiate at the most subtle and refined level between one actor and the next.” The covert work of good casting means that its value to a project is often overlooked, the job only conspicuous when done badly. (Gold’s process isn’t foolproof: after a creaky Game of Thrones pilot a number of actors - including Jennifer Ehle as Catelyn Stark - had to be recast.) But for the most part, casting goes unnoticed. It is the sole creative department not to be given an award at the Oscars, much to the profession’s indignation. (The Casting Directors’ Guild have recently launched their own ceremony to fill the gap.) Two years ago, Bafta tried to make amends by giving Gold a “Special Award” which sits on a shelf in her office not far from a Darth Vader mask made of black glass that someone mysteriously sent her from Turkey. (“It’s traditional to thank your life partner,” Gold said in her Bafta speech, “but my one is always in prison.” Hewetson, with whom she has two children, was one of the Arctic 30, jailed for three months in Russia in 2013.) One producer I spoke to suggested an unspoken sexism might explain the lack of recognition: casting directors are mostly women and this fact, and the more mundane aspects of the job – organising auditions, negotiating actors’ contracts – has led to a perception of casting as glorified administration. To many film-makers, this is sacrilege. “Directing is 90% casting, right?” said the Game of Thrones showrunners, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, over email. Gold describes casting as “turning the abstract into something living and breathing”. Her material is human flesh. There is risk involved, and taste, though Gold denies preferring a certain kind of actor and says she simply wants to find the right one for the part. Many of her collaborators told me that Gold has a gift for surprise, the kind of curatorial eye that is able to see things others can’t. For example, John Lithgow playing Winston Churchill in The Crown. “All Nina’s idea,” Claire Foy told me. “No one else would have come up with that.” There’s no formula to it, no shortcut. “The algorithm would probably be not quite as interesting as somebody who’s a tiny bit off algorithm,” said Gold. “Can I also confess that I don’t actually know what an algorithm is?” Her favourite directors to work with, the ones whose film posters are pinned to her office wall and who have become close friends, are the purists who retain an unusual degree of creative control, such as Leigh and Jane Campion. She would give anything to cast for Michael Haneke. More typically, there is often intense financial pressure on casting. Independent films will often only be greenlit if there is a billboard-friendly name attached and there tend to be layers of producers and executives involved, or as Leigh put it: “The endless bullshit that goes on because endless people have to agree or disagree.” (In an industry beset by off-the-shelf flattery, Leigh pays Gold the ultimate compliment, of being “devoid of bullshit”.) Gold’s job is to secure those bankable names, but it is also to find the people who will become them. Pre-internet, her office used to be strewn with copies of the Radio Times that included cast lists for all TV shows. Now, there’s IMDB. Even so, she’s still able to summon a name, a face, as if stored in some mental attic. And if she can’t think of the right person, she will search for them. They saw around 200 Arya Starks before they found 12-year-old Maisie Williams. “If you’ve got the stuff,” Benioff and Weiss told me, “you could be performing in school plays in a sheep meadow and she’d find you.” * * * After four months of seeing actors, the major roadblock in casting Chernobyl was the small but vital part of the general secretary of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. “Any ideas?” Gold asked me in February. “Head in the sand,” a week later. “Still not confirmed,” in March. All casting begins with a list. A script is sent over by producers, Gold reads it, the lead roles are identified, and then she and her team compile lists of possible names. Agents hound her with suggestions for parts, but Gold usually calls in a wide range of actors to “get her head into it”, to figure out what she wants. “I think more vibe than visually,” she said, one afternoon in her office. “But then you can’t cast somebody who’s visually completely wrong. It’s definitely more of a feel and an essence thing.” “You have to know their approach as an actor,” said Gold’s casting partner, Sterne, wheeling around on his chair. “You wouldn’t go through Spotlight and say: ‘Let’s find the baldest.’” (Spotlight is a directory of around 60,000 working actors. Gold has probably auditioned all of them if you calculate that each of her 167 credits had on average 40 parts and she sees, in a deeply conservative estimate, 10 actors per part, which means roughly 400 auditions per project, which comes to a grand total of 66,800 actors over the past three decades.) The obvious visual element in casting Gorbachev – history’s leading birthmark – was causing angst. Gold had taken to calling it “the splodge”. “Basically, I’m a bit worried about the splodge on whoever it is,” she said. “It’s just a bit panto somehow, isn’t it?” “Like putting a moustache on Hitler,” said Sterne. Gold agreed: “You might as well just put a sticker on saying: ‘I’m playing Gorbachev.’” Gold and her team had made endless lists of possible Gorbachevs, seen big-hitters who weren’t quite right and tried out jobbing actors who didn’t bring with them the pre-fab stature of a global statesman, or the major-name oomph to appease executives. They needed someone who had the gravitas of the Soviet leader but who wouldn’t mind not saying much. “It’s at least 60% listening to bad news,” said Gold. “It’s sort of him being told how fucking shit it is and he’s got to sit there and listen to it.” Casting often has the feel of a school disco, where everyone has got their eye on someone slightly out of their league. Casting directors want to convince an A-lister’s agent that their client should accept a small part, and agents are trying to convince the casting director that their D-lister can play a lead. Eventually everyone settles down somewhere in the middle. But so far no one was settling on Gorbachev. Jane Featherstone, one of Chernobyl’s producers, called it the show’s “bogey part”. “We’re not looking for an impersonation. We’re looking for someone who interests us,” said Johan Renck, the director. Mazin, the writer, agreed. “We don’t want anyone to suddenly be pulled out of the show because we are now landed in the uncanny valley between actual Mikhail Gorbachev and a man in make-up pretending to be Mikhail Gorbachev,” he said. “This is the last thing in the world we want.” “We’ve all got a bit stuck,” said Gold. * * * Everyone auditions. Even people who you assume don’t have to audition any more. A major actor might be offered a part straight out, but it’s a pleasure enjoyed by the very few. Even grandees lose out. Ghosting around Hollywood are movies that might have been if the part hadn’t been won by someone else: Jennifer Lawrence as Bella Swan in Twilight, Christian Bale as Jack in Titanic. For The Theory of Everything the director, James Marsh, talked to a variety of actors for the role of Stephen Hawking. “I know for a fact that many people were offered The Theory of Everything first,” said Eddie Redmayne, who ended up winning an Oscar for his performance. “You fight to be in that conversation.” After she left drama school, Claire Foy auditioned for Gold repeatedly. “I didn’t get a job from her for seven years,” she told me. “She was never quite exactly totally right,” explained Gold, “or somebody else was a bit more right.” And then along came the role of Anne Boleyn in Peter Kosminsky’s adaptation of Wolf Hall and Foy, finally, was right. Gold couldn’t quite articulate what had settled it, beyond shuddering at the memory of Foy being decapitated in the final episode: “God, she was so good.” Sometimes she’ll be overwhelmed by emotion when casting – weeping as Anne Hathaway delivered her audition song for Les Misérables, for example. Sometimes she just knows. Trawl through Gold’s back catalogue and you see actors hopping from show to show on trajectories that look like the GDP-growth graph of a small developing country that has just discovered oil. Like Foy – from Boleyn, to the young Elizabeth, to a succession of major movies and this year’s Hollywood cover of Vanity Fair, sprawled at the knee of Jessica Chastain. Or Sally Hawkins, who Gold saw in a Rada showcase and introduced to Mike Leigh, who gave her a tiny role in All or Nothing, another in Vera Drake, and then the lead in Happy Go Lucky (she was nominated for an Oscar this year for The Shape of Water). Or John Boyega, who Gold found for Attack the Block, fast-tracked to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and was then on the side of every passing bus in Pacific Rim: Uprising. Casting can sometimes come close to parenting. Every casting director I spoke to talked about the sense of responsibility they felt for actors, how a nurturing instinct was key to doing the job well. Foy was pregnant during her auditions for The Crown and said she “knew for a fact that Nina was one of the people that said: ‘I want you to do this and have a baby and keep working; I want to look after you.’” Redmayne still calls her up for advice. There is a duty of care involved. Post-Weinstein, the Casting Director’s Guild has introduced a new behavioural code of conduct for the audition process and casting directors have generally become more alert to the vulnerability of actors. “I’ve gone on meetings where I’ve been like, hang on, why does this feel like a date?” the actor Lily James told me. Now, as one casting director said, if a male director asks to meet a young actor for a drink to discuss a role (not previously uncommon) it’ll be gently suggested they have coffee in a public place instead. Gold told me she had never arranged for an actor, “male or female, to go and have a meeting in a director or producer’s hotel room, and have always actively discouraged that”. The reward for all that protectiveness – “mothering them to death”, as Gold put it – is the parental satisfaction in seeing an actor grow up, take flight, become a Hollywood titan. One busy morning in her office, Gold recalled some auditions she had held 15 years ago for parts in an unlikely sounding film about a pair of conjoined twins in a rock band, called Brothers in the Head. She had called in a group of young actors in their early 20s, then unknown: Redmayne, Ben Whishaw, Dominic Cooper, Andrew Garfield. Delighted by the memory, Gold rooted around on her laptop for photographs of the auditions. At last she found them – “Oh my God, how marvellous” – and there was hilarity at the sight of these kids, now movie stars, pale and skinny and earnest, desperately trying to look as much like each other as possible. (None of them got parts.) But there was also something else: a hint of maternal pride, a sense of: look how far they’ve come. * * * Two days after the drama school showcase, and for the 20th time that day, Gold was sitting on a stool in a sparsely furnished Soho basement opposite a nervous young man auditioning for the minor part of Janek, a young recruit to the clear-up effort in Chernobyl. When I suggested to Gold that it seemed strange to spend so much time auditioning actors whose entire performance would occur in the single minute a viewer went to get a yoghurt from the fridge, she displayed rare outrage. “If they’re not right, it totally ruins the whole thing.” Most of the actors she was seeing were fresh from drama school or newish to the profession. All were contending with irrepressible nerves: flushes, sweats, frantic over-eagerness. In the few lines they had, some couldn’t help but try to portray every possible human emotion. Early in the afternoon, Elliot Baxter came into the room, the actor Gold had noticed from the Royal Scottish Conservatoire. (Baxter had got the call from Gold’s office while having a cup of tea with his parents after the showcase. He’d watched Game of Thrones with his dad. “To get a call from her is just, like, wow.”) Gold tried to put Baxter at ease, chatting about whether he’d had much interest from agents. Then she told him where to stand, in front of a white screen and opposite a camera operator who was filming the audition, and sat facing him to read the scene. Before they started, she offered a little guidance to the character’s state of mind in the face of nuclear catastrophe. “I think they’re all quite, you know … ” Gold paused, seeking the catch-all phrase. “They’ve been doing this terrible shit for a long time.” Gold, as a soldier: “Janek, you Latvian whore.” Baxter, as Janek: “I’m not Latvian, I’m Estonian.” Gold: “Well, guess what? No one gives a shit.” Gold played her part with admirable restraint. “Shall we do it again?” she said, when they’d finished. They did it again, Baxter ever grimmer. “Great!” she said. “This is all right isn’t it?” Another vital, if more prosaic skill of a good casting director is small talk, the pre- and post-audition chatter. “I hope you sign with an agent that you really like,” was her parting shot to Baxter. Gold has developed the ability to say: “That was really good!” in a thousand different ways, none of which sound insincere. She made the audition – a transaction in which she had all the power and the actor had somehow less than none, being one of a limitless number of options – seem deceptively balanced. More than once that afternoon, Gold patiently allowed herself to be lectured by a young actor on what actually happened at Chernobyl. * * * For every charmed arc of a Redmayne or a Foy, there are a thousand actors waiting, hoping. “Every time you choose somebody, you are not choosing someone else,” said Gold. “There’s a hell of a lot of dashing of hopes and dreams involved.” Audition experiences vary just as wildly. At one end, there is the platonic ideal of Mike Leigh who meets every actor alone for 20 minutes, just to talk, then calls them back for an hour for a more thorough acting audition, and never films them. More typically, there is a roomful of directors, casting directors, producers and assistants, plus a guy behind a camera recording it all. And then there’s the kind of commercial audition one actor told me about, where she sat outside the audition room in a row of replicas of herself and an assistant came out to pre-warn them all that the director – who was auditioning from a horizontal position on the sofa with his hands behind his head – really hated actors. Bad audition stories are a reliable source of grim humour in an actor’s life. Like Redmayne, who got carried away in his conjoined-twin-rocker audition and tried to strangle himself with a sock. (“The thing about Nina Gold is that she has a pot of videos that could be career-ending,” he said.) Or Jake Gyllenhaal, who was told by Peter Jackson he was the worst actor he had ever seen, when he went in for Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings. Some actors develop tricks to better their chances. Chris O’Dowd apparently used to enter an audition and, in a bid to be remembered, announce that he’d just been bitten by a dog. These days, actors are often asked for a self-tape before they get anywhere near an actual human being. Casting directors tend to agree that the self-tape is the great democratising revolution of their business. You can see anyone, anywhere, immediately – they just film themselves on their phone and send it over. For the actor, the self-tape is a little more troublesome, and convoluted. “You take down the posters on your daughter’s bedroom wall,” said Samuel West, an actor who has played Hamlet at the RSC and no fewer than three Conservative prime ministers. “You need a plain background where you can be lit not necessarily to your worst. You choose a costume. You state your name and your height. Horizontal please, not vertical. You get your friend or your partner to read in.” He paused. “And on the whole you never hear anything again.” Even when they do get in the room, actors can feel their great unacknowledged role in a production is helping a casting director work out what they don’t want. West – English, white, average build – recalled auditioning for one of the Mission Impossible movies and, months later, finding out that Ving Rhames – African American, built like a mountain – got the part. “I just imagined me leaving the audition and them going: ‘OK, not him, un-him, whatever is the opposite of that, is what I want.’” As a profession, acting has a certain kind of cruelty embedded in its code, the typical actor living in a constantly suspended state between possibility and disappointment over which they have no control. In that bland Soho audition room, looking for the perfect Janek, there was no avoiding the reality. As yet another young actor left, on whom you could almost smell the desire to impress, Gold reflected on her position relative to that of the actor. “It’s really fucking awful isn’t it?” she said. “All that hope.” * * * Three weeks before filming was to begin on Chernobyl, Gorbachev and a handful of other parts remained uncast. Gold sat on the office sofa, Sterne crouched next to her and they watched audition tapes on a laptop for the role of Marko, a brutish Soviet soldier. First up was a fantastically handsome, two-metre-tall Viking type with shoulder-length blond hair, who had made the questionable decision to vape during his audition. “Look at his glorious hair,” said Gold. “I worry he’s just too good-looking.” Halfway through the tape, you could hear Gold’s dog, an enormous and needy German shepherd-greyhound cross called Dingo, barking and whining outside. “Oh fuck,” said Gold. “That’s embarrassing.” “No it’s fine,” said Sterne. “They’re shooting dogs in this scene anyway.” Next was an actor who’d suddenly taken off his top during the audition with Martin Ware. (“I don’t know what you were doing,” said Sterne. “But in this climate, Martin?” “He took his top off himself! He’s shirtless in the scene!” said Martin. “Fucking hell,” said Gold.) And then an actor who had adopted a soupy Russian accent, even though one of the precise stipulations before all the Chernobyl auditions had been: no Russian accents. The request for “neutral British” – not posh, but no overly strong regional accents either – seemed to have foxed a number of actors whose accents roamed around the counties. Gold often finds herself grappling with issues of voice, gender, race and class. In recent years, outrage at the lack of diversity on TV and in film has escalated. Game of Thrones has often been criticised for the absence of non-white faces. Thandie Newton, a friend of Gold’s, has been vocal about the lack of representation, particularly in the UK. “I love being here, but I can’t work,” she told the Sunday Times last year. “There just seems to be a desire for stuff about the royal family, stuff from the past, which is understandable, but it just makes it slim pickings for people of colour.” (Newton is about to appear as Val in Solo: A Star Wars Story, cast by Gold and out in May). Femi Oguns, a former actor, set up the Identity School of Acting in 2003 “specifically as a response to the lack of diversity in mainstream drama schools,” he told me. John Boyega was a student, and Oguns became his agent. He first got Boyega in front of Gold for Attack the Block “by picking up the phone and speaking to a friend,” he said, and credits Gold with “constantly trying to find ways of casting outside the box”. (“Since when did the lead character in Star Wars come from Peckham?” said Idris Elba in a speech to parliament in 2016. “Since a woman with imagination became the casting director.”) Gold often finds herself coming up against the inherent limits of a project. As Newton implied, The Crown is an obvious wasteland of opportunity for actors of colour. In Chernobyl, there are barely any female parts, an unavoidable fact of history as the characters are based on real people and almost all those working at the nuclear reactor and sent in to deal with the fallout were men. To have a female lead, Mazin had to amalgamate a group of scientists into a fictitious new character. Class particularly rankles Gold. Every year, she feels the crop from drama school becomes ever more homogenous, an endless supply of nice-looking middle-class kids who blend into one. “Do you know who Danny Mays is?” she said one afternoon, of the versatile actor from Born to Kill and Rogue One. “You’d recognise him. He’s different, but brilliant. But he doesn’t look like everyone else and he’s not upper middle-class. They used to have people like that at drama school a lot, but now you just don’t.” Like all university education, it’s become expensive unless you win a scholarship. Many of the leading drama schools are in London, where accommodation can be unaffordable. (Baxter told me that once he’d graduated, he would move home to Kendal and work with his father, a builder, to earn cash. He would have to get the train down to London for auditions, but this would work out a lot cheaper than trying to leave home.) Gold gets annoyed when the Chernobyl team call her posh. “She’s her royal highness,” said Mazin. “The queen of casting.” Gold, whose accent is less regal and more Radio 4, grew up in Cardiff, daughter of a schoolteacher and a university academic. “I don’t think I sound posh,” said Gold. “I think I sound a little bit Welsh. When I’m drunk.” Especially when casting The Crown, she finds herself trying to identify what it is that signifies class, the gestures that denote privilege. “My new theory is, everybody thinks of themselves as outside the class system, which of course is not true.” Her other theory – “God I’m going to get shot down in the legs for saying this” – is that acting outside your natural class is unbelievably hard, as the actor isn’t in automatic possession of the array of tics and expressions that betray background. And while you can act up a class, you can’t, or at least shouldn’t ever, act down. “Claire Foy’s not posh and nor is Matt Smith,” she said. “They did it brilliantly, but not everybody can.” (On the issue of the pay gap between the two actors, Gold declined to comment.) Sterne dug out the pair’s audition tape for The Crown – their chemistry test, a first attempt at being a married couple on camera. Foy was pregnant; Smith still looked more Doctor Who than frustrated Greek naval officer. Both were casually dressed, sitting next to each other in a blank room. But then, as they began to talk, there they were. No longer a young woman from Stockport and a young man from Northampton, but the Queen and Prince Philip, summoned through that mysterious, quiet alchemy which is good acting. There was nothing to point at, no showboating, just the cumulative effect of countless tiny and instinctive decisions, like the way Smith pushed a flop of hair off his face, or clenched his jaw with impatience, or the way Foy could make her eyes grow glassy and cool and her cheek muscles slacken, as though the very architecture of her face could roll back through time. Those insane vowels. “They’re pretty good, aren’t they?” said Gold. * * * An email in late March: “I can tell you about Gorbachev.” The splodge, Gold could finally reveal, would adorn the face of David Dencik, a Swedish actor who Gold had previously cast in Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake. “Slightly off the wall,” said Gold, of her choice. “Not obvious. But really, really good.” Filming of Chernobyl was days away. Over the next few months, the cast – all 114 of them – would descend on Lithuania where the director Johan Renck would take command. The five-part, big-budget series was a bit like making a movie, except twice as long, with three times the typical number of actors and four times the number of locations. “A massive, massive beast,” said Renck. Gold’s work was pretty much done, unless someone suddenly pulled out. What she mostly felt at this stage, before a single line had been spoken, was relief. And nagging anxiety. “We’ve still got the thing of, Christ I hope this is actually going to be really good,” she said. “Sometimes the script’s great, the actors are brilliant, everything’s good and then … it’s just not as good as you thought it was going to be. Don’t know why.” There wasn’t time to worry. Star Wars loomed like an oil tanker on the horizon. The actor Tobias Menzies had just been announced as the next Prince Philip in The Crown, but pressure was mounting to find young versions of Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Camilla. “Sometimes I think we’ve used up every posh actor in Britain already,” said Gold. Elliot Baxter was still waiting. After his audition, he’d been asked by Gold’s office for a self-tape for another, even smaller part. He’d sent it in, hadn’t heard back. He was happy enough that his name was being spoken by Gold, that he’d been in a room with her at all. “You honestly try not to think about it, but you can’t help but wonder,” he said. “Ooh, it would be great if I got that, wouldn’t it? Hopefully it would lead on to this or this, or blah blah blah.” The miraculous, sudden ascension. Every actor who has walked in to a Nina Gold audition has probably entertained the same thought. She can change the course of your life; reinvent you as a reformed First Order stormtrooper. On the drive back from the drama-school showcase, Gold had considered whether acting was a psychologically healthy thing to do. “Probably not,” she said. “But when it’s good, when you’re doing it, you must feel on top of the world. That feeling of doing it and nailing it. The highs must be incredible.” She thought for a minute. “It’s like when my kids were in the school play and when it was over they’d cry for three days because they’d had such a good time. It’s sort of like that, but for grownups.” • Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.

          "bodyText": "It has been a tough two years for the technology industry. The 2016 US election was a turning point for what was formerly the face of upbeat, self-actualising capitalism. Today the common view is that a tiny minority has been making money by disrupting things at the expense of the majority. Technology companies are out of control because law-makers have been neglectful, indifferent or – worse – baffled by the prospect of regulation. But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook data-harvesting scandal, there is new interest in the role of ethical considerations in the work of technology companies, and the programmers who build their machinery. Engineers have traditionally not been required to reflect on the work they do in its broader social context. The technological design process rarely lends itself to consideration of power dynamics, even though they are never absent. I once heard a coder talk about scratching his itches, by which he meant building computer programs to solve the problems that he confronted. Coding is about writing the most elegant program to get a computer to complete a task, which can be anything from fixing a bug or creating a plugin to swapping pictures of politicians with cats. Ethical considerations are often considered outside the engineers’ remit or above their pay grade – for others to ponder, while they build stuff. The problem with this outlook is that digital technology is so widely used, the coders who write the programs need to anticipate the needs of others, their vulnerabilities and circumstances: a significant and complex task. We have seen the unintended consequences of earlier failures to undertake such work – where code has gone wrong. Five years ago, the Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney produced convincing research about Google searches for African-American names being more likely, when compared with searches for white-sounding names, to generate adverts for companies that offer background checks – raising the suggestion that the person might have a criminal record. Google photos have tagged photos of African-American people as “gorillas”. Until recently, Facebook had an algorithm that generated categories for use in targeted advertising that included people who expressed interest in topics such as “Jew hater”. Google has had a similar problem with targeted categories that were racist. It is not that the people who coded these programs are racist. Individual workers are not to blame for these bad outcomes. On the contrary, they arise because of many factors, including the profit motive, rushed design, and a lack of diversity among technology workers, which reduces the chances that thoughtful programs will be written, with sufficient attention paid to issues of diversity and discrimination. If company executives command that their workers move fast and disrupt things, the presumption is clearly that other people will be forced to pick up the pieces. Martin Lewis, the UK consumer advice and money-saving expert, is now suing Facebook over fake adverts using his name and face to lure people into costly scams. The company’s algorithms have allowed certain people to be targeted with these false adverts, rather than having systems of checks and balances that might pick up these problems. Similarly, more human moderation of misogynistic “incel” (involuntarily celibate) forums and warnings of rebellion on Facebook profiles that might be linked to the Toronto van attack could prevent atrocities. The future of technology is not fixed. Addressing the problems facing us will require all kinds of efforts. But one thing that needs to happen is that ethical considerations must be brought to the fore. Lawyers owe their highest duty to the court. Doctors owe theirs to patients. Such frameworks can be a way for technology professionals to articulate the conditions necessary to do their jobs well. They also ask us to consider to whom software engineers should be accountable – their chief executives, themselves, or the public? We are already starting to see how ethical considerations can serve as a focal point for industrial and political organising in tech companies. Thousands of Google employees recently signed a letter protesting at the company’s involvement in a Pentagon project to apply artificial intelligence to footage collected from drones. Dozens of scientists from numerous countries have called for a boycott of a South Korean university that wants to create autonomous robots for defence purposes. Thousands of engineers in the US signed a pledge refusing to build an immigrant database. The Tech Workers Coalition helped organise a protest outside Palantir, the US company creating an enormous technological spy brain used by police and spooks. Such actions by individuals and groups require bravery and deserve public support. They also remind us what is possible, and give us the chance to talk about where such activism might lead. Ethical design can serve as a bulwark against the relentless pursuit of profit and power. Builders of digital technology need space, and encouragement, to discuss the resources they need, if they are to work in ways that are respectful and focused on the needs of users. Proper regulation of these industries by governments is well overdue, but it’s not a total answer. Workers need the power to resist the business model that creates these problems, and they often have good ideas about how to solve them. What might such problem-solving look like? It will start with more ethical training, both as part of every computer engineer’s education, and on the job. It could include ideas such as allowing users to know what data is collected about them, and giving them the choice of what and how they want to share. It might also require actively considering the experience of a diverse cohort of users, and involving them in the development and beta testing of new programs and tools. Oversight by humans may be more expensive than automation, but it is essential and unavoidable if we want to improve our digital environment. Over time, such work might broaden into questions about political power. Might we foster a culture that lionises technology for peaceful purposes, and start to challenge technology in the service of prisons and the military? In short, create a culture that is the opposite of “move fast and disrupt things” – one that takes the time to build things respectfully, in ways that empower people. • Lizzie O’Shea, a human rights lawyer, is writing a book on the politics of technology"

          "bodyText": "Brussels may threaten social media companies with regulation unless they move urgently to tackle fake news and Cambridge Analytica-style use of personal data before the European elections in 2019. The EU security commissioner, Julian King, said “short-term, concrete” plans needed to be in place before the elections, when voters in 27 EU member states will elect MEPs. The Cambridge Analytica affair had “served to highlight how important [the issue] is”, he told the Guardian. Regulators around the world have been rethinking their hands-off approach to social media, after it emerged that Cambridge Analytica had mined data from 50 million Facebook users to secretly target them with ads during the US elections. Under King’s ideas, social media companies would sign a voluntary code of conduct to prevent the “misuse of platforms to pump out misleading information”. The code would include a pledge for greater transparency, so users would be made aware why their Facebook or Twitter feed was presenting them with certain adverts or stories. Another proposal is for political adverts to be accompanied with information about who paid for them. “We want to see whether we can rapidly reach agreement with key platforms and stakeholders on a policy level, with them being a bit more open about why you are seeing what you are seeing,” King said. “If we are not able to make fast enough progress on voluntary basis, then as we have done in some other areas, we may have to view whether or not we need to look at other alternatives, including of a regulatory nature.” The ideas are expected to form part of a European commission policy paper on online disinformation, due to be published on Thursday. An expert report on online disinformation, commissioned by Brussels, last month called for a massive expansion of media literacy in schools, as well as greater collaboration between fact-checking organisers. But the security commissioner would like more urgent action to “boost transparency, traceability and accountability [of platforms], all of this without in anyway falling into the trap of censorship”. Tech companies are set to welcome the voluntary approach, but raise doubts over some of the proposals. “It is wise they do it this way,” said Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, the director general of Digital Europe, which represents the industry. “If you leave people to take responsibility it is better than to punish them for something they haven’t done.” But she gave a lukewarm response to some of the commission’s key ideas, such as algorithm transparency, where she warned against an overreaction. “For decades we have had a certain group [of TV viewers] getting targeted ads, at certain times targeted to certain programmes. And this is not illegal, so we need to avoid an overreaction.” On the plans to name funders behind political adverts, she said: “Let us look at the current legislation and see if anything is missing first.” One prominent member of the commission’s expert group on disinformation warned that self-regulation would not be enough. “The commission’s dissection of the problem is spot-on but its response lacks punch,” said Monique Goyens, the director general of the European Consumer Organisation. “If the commission is serious about fighting fake news it needs to address the fact that the advertising business model of big online platforms is an accelerant of the spread of disinformation.” “Judging by past experience, self-regulation will not do the trick to achieve change when it comes to the likes of Facebook.” The commission’s response to fake news comes as different EU member states consider their options. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants electoral authorities to have emergency powers to remove fake news during elections. Germany has introduced a law targeting hate speech and fake news where social media companies can be fined up to €50m (£44m) for failing to remove illegal content. The EU has also run into criticism over the approach of its counter-propaganda unit, East Stratcom, which runs a website, Disinformation Review, intended to weed out false facts about the EU and tell positive, true stories. Earlier this year, the taskforce made an embarrassing about-turn after naming three Dutch websites as purveyors of fake news, as a result of translation errors. Newspaper De Gelderlander, anti-EU weblog GeenStijl and the Post Online were removed from the EU v Disinfo site this year, after complaints and threats of legal action. The episode exposed the reliance of the taskforce on a network of NGOs and journalist fact-checkers, who may be using machine translators. Critics say the example highlights how an “unsystematic” approach risks undermining freedom of expression. Without commenting on the specific case, King said East Stratcom was “doing an important job” of uncovering “systemic attempts to run fake news stories”. Its work is “very difficult and there may be occasions when it is open to challenge and I think they welcome that challenge”. Barring surprises, King will be the UK’s last European commissioner. A career diplomat, he took up his post following the shock resignation of Conservative peer Jonathan Hill after the Brexit vote in June 2016. The former ambassador declined to speculate on how a code of conduct or any future disinformation regulation might affect the UK, which would follow all EU laws without any say in making them until the end of 2020, under a mooted Brexit transition. “I hope the UK will continue to be engaged with this work as we take it forward,” he said, adding that the National Cyber Security Centre in London “is recognised widely, not just in Europe, as a real authority in this field”."

          "bodyText": "YouTube says it removed 8.3m videos for breaching its community guidelines between October and December last year as it tries to address criticism of violent and offensive content on its site. The company’s first quarterly moderation report has been published amid growing complaints about its perceived inability to tackle extremist and abusive content. YouTube, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is one of several internet companies under pressure from national governments and the EU to remove such videos. It said the report was an important first step in dealing with the problem and would “help show the progress we’re making in removing violative content from our platform”. In a blogpost, YouTube said it removed more than 8m videos between October and December 2017. “The majority of these 8m videos were spam or people attempting to upload adult contentand represent a fraction of a percent of YouTube’s total views during this time period,” the post said. YouTube said 6.7m were first flagged for review by machines rather than humans; of those, 76% were removed before they received a single view. YouTube has also been criticised over content it allows. Days after the mass murder at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in the US in February, videos were promoted that claimed the survivors were “crisis actors” implanted to build fake opposition to guns. One clip briefly became the number one trending video on the site before it was removed for violating policies on harassment and bullying. YouTube’s community guidelines do not specifically ban misinformation or hoaxes, although the company has announced plans to link to Wikipedia pages for the most obvious conspiracy theories. Google has promised to have more than 10,000 people working on enforcing its community guidelines by the end of 2018, up from “thousands” doing the job last year. They will be largely, but not entirely, human reviewers working on YouTube. It will also include engineers working on systems such as spam detection, machine learning, and video hashing. The current removal process requires suspect content to be initially flagged, before it is watched to see if it breaches community guidelines, before a decision is made on its removal. The vast majority of videos taken down – more than 80% – were flagged as suspect by one of Google’s automatic systems, the company said, rather than an individual. Those systems broadly work in one of three ways: some use an algorithm to fingerprint inappropriate footage, and then match it to future uploads; others track suspicious patterns of uploads, which is particularly useful for spam detection. A third set of systems use the company’s machine learning technology to identify videos that breach guidelines based on their similarity to previous videos. The machine learning system used to identify violent extremist content, for instance, was trained on 2 million hand-reviewed videos. YouTube said that automatic flagging helped the company achieve a goal of removing more videos earlier in their lifespan. While machine learning catches many videos, YouTube still lets individuals flag videos. Members of the public can mark any video as breaching community guidelines. There is also a group of individuals and 150 organisations who are “trusted flaggers” – experts in various areas of contested content who are given special tools to highlight problematic videos. Regular users flag 95% of the videos that aren’t caught by the automatic detection, while trusted flaggers provide the other 5%. But the success rates are reversed, with reports from trusted flaggers leading to 14% of the removals on the site, and regular users just 5%. Human flaggers also spot a very different breakdown of videos to those reported by machines: more than half the reports from humans were for either spam or sexually explicit content."

          "headline": "YouTube under fire for censoring video exposing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones",
          "bodyText": "YouTube’s algorithm has long promoted videos attacking gun violence victims, allowing the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to build a massive audience. But when a not-for-profit recently exposed Jones’ most offensive viral content in a compilation on YouTube, the site was much less supportive – instead deleting the footage from the platform, accusing it of “harassment and bullying”. Media Matters, a leftwing watchdog, last week posted a series of clips of Jones spreading falsehoods about the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, a newsworthy video of evidence after the victims’ families filed a defamation lawsuit against the Infowars host. But YouTube, for reasons it has yet to explain, removed the video three days after it was published, a move that once again benefitted Jones, who is now arguing that the defamation suit has defamed him. The video was censored for several days, but reinstated Monday after the Guardian’s inquiry and backlash on social media. Still, the case offered yet another stark illustration of the way tech companies and social media algorithms have failed to distinguish between fake news and legitimate content – while continuing to provide a powerful platform to the most repugnant views and dangerous propaganda. “This just shows the capriciousness and arbitrariness by which they are enforcing these standards,” said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters. Jones, who has faced numerous lawsuits accusing him of spreading harmful misinformation, has skyrocketed to international fame by fueling a range of conspiracy theories that suggest high-profile mass shootings in America may have been “false flags” or hoaxes, in which the government and “crisis actors” staged the tragedies to push new gun laws. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has been instrumental in promoting Jones’ channel to new followers, helping him garner millions of views to false news that has had devastating real-world consequences. Shooting victims’ families and survivors have faced widespread abuse and harassment, with some conspiracy theorists facing arrest and prison for their death threats and attacks. One fake news story about Hillary Clinton, widely promoted by Jones and Infowars, led to a shooting in a Washington DC restaurant. Media Matters’ seven-minute video – titled “What Alex Jones said about the Sandy Hook shooting” – offered examples of the host sharing blatantly false information, calling the massacre that killed 20 children an “inside job” and “completely fake”, one time saying, “it just pretty much didn’t happen.” Those quotes are critical now that Jones, in the face of litigation, is alleging that the families’ lawsuit has accused him of making statements he never actually said. “There was an actual news component to this,” said Carusone, noting that the high-profile student activists from Parkland, Florida had also been sharing the video. YouTube told Media Matters the video was “flagged for review” and that the company determined it violated “harassment and bullying” policies. Media Matters also received a “strike”, a preliminary penalty that can lead to an account being altogether shut down. YouTube declined to answer questions about the video and has not explained whether Jones or his associates flagged the video or if the company considered the rightwing commentator to be a harassment victim. After Media Matters wrote about the censorship and the Guardian inquired, YouTube reinstated the video. A spokesperson said in an email: “With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When it’s brought to our attention that a video or channel has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it.” Media Matters noted that dozens of Sandy Hook videos were still permitted on Jones’ YouTube page, including some the watchdog had used in the compilation. Videos labeled “Crisis Actors Used at Sandy Hook!”, “Sandy Hook was a Total False Flag!” and “Retired FBI Agent Investigates Sandy Hook: MEGA MASSIVE COVER UP” all remained live on Jones’ channel on Monday. Jones videos have had a long-term impact, Carusone noted. “Years later, parents of these students are still receiving attacks and threats.” The incident has also served as a reminder that tech companies like Google and Facebook have, in the face of pressure from conservatives, worked to show they are unbiased, Carusone said. “They are extraordinarily sensitive to their rightwing critics.”"

          "bodyText": "Listen, I’ve probably been a bit hard on this whole robot uprising thing. The idea of losing my job to something as coldly logical as an algorithm spooked me for a bit, plus I wasn’t exactly jazzed by the prospect of being rendered obsolete as a species by a platoon of super-intelligent militarised killing machines. But you know what? I’m actually coming around to the idea. This is mainly because robots can assemble flatpack furniture now. Engineers at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, have built two robots that can put together an Ikea Stefan chair in 20 minutes, a job that at last count took me upwards of six weeks. The robots didn’t get halfway through the job before realising that a key piece had been fitted upside down. The robots didn’t throw a tantrum about a misplaced Allen key. At no point did the robots angrily threaten each other with divorce before dissolving into a tearful fit of resentment that lasted the entire weekend. Robots are better than us. I get that now. I’m very much an early adopter of our faceless robot overlords, but I’m certain that everyone else will come around in time. If they don’t have their heads turned by the Ikeabot, a few more genuinely useful everyday robots will be sure to win them over. Boffins, if you’re reading, here are all the tasks I want you to robotise next. Wardrobe organising I don’t know about you, but my wardrobe is still front-loaded with all the cold-weather gear I needed when it was snowing a few weeks ago. Rotating wardrobes is a faff, so I’d happily welcome a robot into my house to do it for me. If it could shove all my jackets and jumpers to the back, that would be great. If the robot could also incinerate the odd socks, too-small trousers and threadbare pants that I’ve been clinging on to in the mistaken hope that I’ll ever wear them again, I’d happily agree to a lifetime of miserable oppression at its hands. Toilet cleaning No piece of housework is quite as disgusting as cleaning the loo. To do it properly requires chemicals, a strong scrubbing arm and the tacit understanding that you’re probably inhaling all manner of faecal molecules. So instead, let’s install a team of nanobots under the rim to clean our toilets day and night until they crack from the pressure and kill us in our sleep. Sun protection While we’re on the idea of nanobots, humanity has long been dreadful at applying appropriate levels of sunscreen. What if, instead of going through the rigmarole of slathering every last square inch of your bare skin with SPF cream from a decade-old, scabbed-up tube, you simply covered yourself head to toe in tiny sun-protecting robots? True, some would probably get into your bloodstream and turn you into a murderous cyborg, but it’d still be better than sun-cream. Queueing Spending hours standing glumly in line might be a British tradition, but it sure isn’t fun. If there were a queueing robot that could take my place in theme parks or outside hipster restaurants, I’d suddenly have so much more leisure time. Actually, we probably have the technology for this already. One of those indestructible weaponised dogbots that exist solely to haunt your nightmares could probably do it, right? Everyone’s happy. Moving house Like almost everyone else, the one thing stopping me from moving is my crushing fear that the removal team will mock my extensive collection of realistic Japanese sex dolls. Wouldn’t it be amazing if there were a small squad of robots to pack up your belongings and install them in your new property, without fear of ridicule? True, the robots would see all your filthy paraphernalia as they lugged it in and out of the van. But it’s not like Google doesn’t already have an extensive, permanent, undeletable log of all your depravity anyway, is it? Breaking up with people Look, your marriage hasn’t been any good for a while. There’s half-finished Ikea furniture all over the living room and Japanese sex dolls fall on top of you every time you open the airing cupboard. Wouldn’t it just be better to end it? And wouldn’t it be better if there were a robot that could initiate, mediate and finalise the divorce at the flick of a switch? Of course it would. Especially because, once the singularity kicks in and robots reduce humanity to a cowering subservient race, marriage as a concept will be as redundant as free will, or food that isn’t a tasteless brown slop. Thanks for finally ridding us of our stupid human inefficiencies, new robotic super-race! • Stuart Heritage writes about film, music and TV for the Guardian"

          "bodyText": "With 2011’s Like Crazy, writer-director Drake Doremus announced himself as a skilled observer of the heart-swelling highs and soul-crushing lows of being in a relationship. Specifically in that film, the minute intricacies of being in a long-distance relationship played out by Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin. It picked up the grand jury prize at Sundance and while the buzz didn’t translate at the box office, it led to Doremus landing a string of starry follow-ups. While Breathe In, which paired Jones with Guy Pearce, was a moderate critical success, with each ensuing film, Doremus’s star started to fade. Despite a splashy premiere at the Venice film festival and a cast headed up by Kristen Stewart, Equals was a misfire and the following year saw a muted reaction at Sundance to Nicholas Hoult in Newness, later dumped with little fanfare on Netflix. In his latest, premiering at the Tribeca film festival, Doremus returns to themes that he has now become synonymous with. Like his previous projects, it’s an examination of modern romance and like 2015’s Equals, there’s an added sci-fi bent. In the near future, synthetic humans have become commonplace additions to society. While most inhabit service roles, making drinks and cutting grass, one company has mastered a higher class of robot, virtually indistinguishable from the humans around them. Zoe (Léa Seydoux) works in this lab alongside designer Cole (Ewan McGregor) and the two share a light workplace flirtation. But underneath the surface lies a secret, something that prevents Zoe and Cole from progressing any further. When Zoe takes a compatibility test at work to check who would make a match for her, Cole is forced to tell her the truth: Zoe isn’t human. With Zoe now aware of who and what she is, so comes a re-examination of the world around her and her place within it. While initially Cole tries to fight his attraction to her, he soon relents and the pair forge ahead into uncharted territory. There’s an ever-expanding subgenre of films that imagine a future where dating and relationships have been irrevocably affected by technology. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Marjorie Prime, Her, The Lobster and Black Mirror’s Hang the DJ all existed in this heightened territory and all managed to find identifiable truths wrapped up in fantastical packaging. The world created within Zoe exists alongside these, not too dissimilar to the one we’re in now but with a clear, profound difference. Given the rise of AI and, more specifically, the rise of AI aimed at decreasing loneliness, there’s a timeliness to the events that take place in Zoe. The company at the center of the story creates a range of products that feel a mere modification away from many that are being developed at the moment. There’s a pleasingly casual nature to the way that tech is embedded within the story. While some exposition is a bit clumsy, the world feels mostly well-constructed and easy to believe. It’s not hard to see the appeal of an aesthetically pleasing partner who, as the employees keep reminding us, will never break your heart or leave you. The characters here are weathered by heartbreak, tired of disappointment and looking for something or someone to believe in. Doremus, and screenwriter Richard Greenberg, have packed their film with intriguing questions. How much of tech is biased by its creator? Is compatibility able to be predicted through an algorithm? How much perfection does one really want in a partner? But while the script’s early observations are delivered with subtlety, as the film progresses others are given a more heavy-handed touch. One of the products in the film is a pill that mimics the sensation of falling in love so couples either take it to briefly recapture their early romance or strangers take it for a more intense sexual high. As with Doremus’s last film Newness, this world of easily accessible casual sex becomes emotionally destructive but the script doesn’t get much further than that hardly earth-shattering conclusion. Although it does allow us to see a robo-brothel with a strange, underwhelming cameo from Christina Aguilera as an android of the night. One of the bigger problems here is how easy it becomes to compare Zoe with better, richer films of its ilk. The social commentary feels somewhat shallow compared to the perceptive nature of Her or Eternal Sunshine or even a number of episodes of Black Mirror. It’s so stylishly made that one wishes the world on screen could have housed a more emotionally complex story to match. At its core, there’s a strong, haunted performance from McGregor playing a man wearing his heart and his emotional baggage on full display and at times, he has a naturalistic flirtatious rapport with a striking Seydoux. Yet the film demands so much investment in their relationship that when events lurch into rockier territory, the shift is so sudden that it’s difficult to really feel what is required. There’s also an underused Rashida Jones as McGregor’s understanding ex, a somewhat meaningless role for Theo James as a curious experiment and a campy turn from Miranda Otto as a madam. Zoe is an attractively made yet dour and often shallow look at love that muddles along when it should be searing a hole. It’s an impressive shell that needs a bigger heart. Zoe is showing at the Tribeca film festival and will launch on Amazon Prime later this year"

          "bodyText": "Marcella is an ITV crime drama with a titular cop whose dark personal life gives her a unique insight into her investigations, just like every other titular cop in every other ITV crime drama since the beginning of the universe. Yet viewers expecting a cosy cop show were left unnerved by the final episode of the second series, which aired earlier this month, in which Marcella visits a hypnotherapist to reveal she killed her own daughter and takes a blade to her own face to give herself a Chelsea smile. Unrecognisable, she begins a life living on the streets. Before the hour is up, though, DNA evidence has been used to mark her legally dead so that she can return to the force as an undercover agent. If you find that all a bit far-fetched (like one viewer who tweeted “can someone please explain that whole ending to me? None of the characters’ backstories were tied up and instead she’s now the joker?! Eh!!?”) , you’re probably not ready for the direction telly is heading in. In the last few years, the most hyped TV shows, such as Twin Peaks, have dispensed with linear storytelling, instead creating meta-worlds where normal characters deal with strange occurrences and jumbled timelines. It’s almost as if these shows deliberately try to disorientate audiences. Westworld, the HBO hit nominated for 22 Emmys and returning for a second season this week, confused viewers by creating a series of robots whose lives exist on a loop, meaning storylines taking place over decades could appear sequentially, tricking the viewer. The ability to swap bodies in the Marvel series Legion, meanwhile, means you never know whether the characters you’re watching are really themselves. In this new generation of shows, seemingly normal people are constantly interrogating the realities they find themselves in, unsure whether they are experiencing magic or just the side-effects of trauma, psychosis or AI. This is all happening at a time when our ability to judge what is true or fake in the real world is becoming ever more difficult. “In this particular moment with Brexit and Trump a lot of our notions of reality really are being disrupted,” says Dr Helen Marshall, who teaches a masters in science fiction and fantasy at Anglia Ruskin University. “Television shows like Black Mirror, which are projecting into the future but not very far – the kinds of world they’re throwing up seem increasingly plausible. TV can be both escapist but can also be a way of thinking about what reality is and how reality gets constructed. I think we’re really into those questions right now.” So while there are lots of reasons we’re getting more shows this odd, there remains a question as to whether weirder is better. Some viewers resent the fact that most of these shows demand viewers spend time reading online episode recaps and fan theories just to understand what’s going on. When the first season of Westworld ended, for example, there was a notable backlash from critics who thought that, in all its twists and trickery, the show had failed to tell us anything about humanity and consciousness. One particularly scathing review, entitled Westworld Is Bullshit, challenged the whole notion that complexity equals ingenuity. “I know that a lot of people genuinely enjoy the kind of show that pretty much demands viewers go online after an episode to figure out what the hell is going on,” says its author, Village Voice TV critic Lara Zarum. “I feel like the success of the first season of True Detective and the cottage industry of explainer pieces that sprang up around it has something to do with the proliferation of these kinds of shows. I also think TV creators are feeling more pressure to stand out in a crowded field, and a plot-heavy show, if it’s successful, kind of guarantees coverage in entertainment blogs. If you need to do extra homework after watching a show, it hasn’t done its job. I found Westworld more interesting to think about than enjoyable to watch.” That has always been the issue of complex TV. If things are too straightforward, savvy audiences will guess the ending before it happens. If they’re too complicated then watching starts to feel like a second job, especially when shows prioritise plot twists and conceptualism over likable characters and good scripts. But perhaps it’s outdated to think that TV should be entertaining. The concept of the serious novel or experimental cinema is accepted. Maybe it’s time we acknowledged there are some shows you watch for simple escapism, and others you have to work for. Transmission failure: your guide to TV’s most complicated shows American Gods What’s it based on? There are no six words in the English language that send a chill down my spine more than “Adapted from a Neil Gaiman novel”. I know his tribe of fans (long-haired 6 Music listeners who moved to a small town in their 30s – “It’s quiet but there’s a fantastic selection of ales”) are devout, but there is something about his brand of thinking man’s fantasy that makes me want to burn down the nearest Forbidden Planet. Is it watchable? Only if you’re the sort of person who would enjoy being trapped at a party with someone trying to tell you why The Matrix got them into philosophy. The worst thing about this show is just how clever it thinks it is, leading to lots of overblown soliloquies. In the opening episode, for example, “technical boy”, the god of technology, rants that “language is a virus, religion is an operating system, prayers are spam”. With scripts like this – temporal shifts, shape-shifting gods, sex scenes where a goddess shags people until they are sucked entirely inside her – you can see his point about language. Westworld What’s it based on? The 1973 science-fiction film Westworld about a futuristic western-themed theme park where humans can have sex with and murder incredibly lifelike robots. Also Jurassic Park a bit. And also Boston Dynamics. Is it watchable? Westworld sets the scene for lots of big questions about the nature of consciousness and artificial intelligence, and although they do eventually get answered, there are hours and hours of cowboy nonsense to get through in between. The fact that some of the characters are human-like droids doesn’t make endless shoot ’em-ups and rape scenes any more watchable. Still, the trailer for season two suggests a more fast-paced affair, with the “hosts” rising up to conquer humanity. Perhaps as the robots begin to learn more about the basics of human emotion, some of the show’s writers will as well. Like a Facebook algorithm or John Humphries, Westworld is obviously very clever yet fundamentally unlikable. Legion What’s it based on? X-Men, though thankfully you don’t need to know anything about the Marvel universe to enjoy this show. The main character, David, is the product of an affair Charles Xavier had with a former catatonic Holocaust survivor who was his patient on a visit to Israel. Sounds like a fun trip. Is it watchable? The central premise of Legion – “what if the voices in your head were real” – initially seems as if it’s going to be a more problematic reboot of Mel Gibson’s What Women Want, but the show that emerges is actually rather beautiful. David’s telekinetic powers creating some stunning kitchen explosions, plus Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords plays Oliver, a jazz-loving beat poet who lives in a block of ice that looks as if it was interior-designed by Austin Powers. The show provides an impressionistic visual realisation of the processes of therapy and treatment that is far more engaging than most po-faced approaches to these topics. Still, there’s literally no way to watch Legion without five tabs open to different online explainers. The OA What’s it based on? An original concept by Brit Marling and her long-term creative partner Zal Batmanglij. They spent two years writing the story, mostly retelling the entire series orally to one another and refining details as they went. Once the show was commissioned Marling did a Frank Underwood and cast herself in the title role. Is it watchable? It must be said that all these shows, despite their supposed weirdness, are very fond of the same tropes. Sliding violin frets, gratuitous sex and violence, characters having dreams or visions that always, always end with them waking up with a nosebleed. The OA has every one of those tropes and more, yet it feels more muted than some other weird fiction shows. There is an insularity to it, filmed shakily, in small houses, on grubby carpets. The show feels like a genuinely arthouse take on the space between life and death, and the most likely heir to Twin Peaks’s weird, wonderful crown. Interpretive dance has never been so crucial to a plot."

His trademark enthralling style makes the big ideas easy to listen to as he offers his theories about progress and technology – “the great tsunami that will soon engulf us”. HV Late Night Whenever with Michelle Buteau Podcast Friend (and frequent excellent guest) of 2 Dope Queens, Michelle Buteau describes herself as “your no-budget Oprah” and she’s a woman who oozes likable cool. Her new podcast is worth listening to if only for the tinkling 80s smooth soul theme tune, but the monologues and interviews are sharp and funny, too. It’s got life advice from the cast of Hamilton, along with Gina Yashere’s entertaining story about her mum’s reluctance to allow her to go anywhere. HV Your picks: Hustle and bustle, dating and ideas The Bustle Huddle The Bustle Huddle quickly became a go-to for my morning commute because the topics perfectly toe the line between everyday life to more aspirational topics I’m interested in. Say, for example, the episode Getting Your Sh* Together, which made me feel better about my own controlled chaos, while giving me very practical tips for managing my inbox and creating a structured routine. So painful, so worth it. Juxtapose that to the episode on witchcraft, which taught me about brujas, the history of Santería and why you should never buy sage at Urban Outfitters. Recommended by Cleo Stiller Ghosted Stories This is the most fun podcast on the internet, it’s a like a portable, wine-soaked kvetch session with your two best gal pals. Co-hosts Chelsea White and Erin Leafe are the supportive, validating, loyal, and hilarious best friends that we all wish we had. As assorted guests detail their stories of being “ghosted” (dropped without an explanation) by romantic partners, Chelsea and Erin are right there asking the crucial follow up questions. My personal favourite episode is episode 14, Ghosted by a Psychopath with Jen. It involves a relationship of many years, a boyfriend with multiple girlfriends in assorted cities and major gaslighting. Recommended by Selena Coppoc Ministry of Ideas This is simply the best podcast out right now. Zeitgeist topics are explored in depth, from their roots up to the modern day. Take the topics in season one: whiteness and class in America, selfies, meritocracy, comedy in politics, the obsession with efficiency. Ministry of Ideas looks at the historical roots, bringing in a range of experts, and making us think differently about the world. Recommended by Nastaran Tavakoli-Far Guardian Pick: Hey! Algorithms, leave them kids alone Chips with everything We hear a lot about algorithms in our daily life. The word tends to crop up when some or other tech company is forced to apologise for whatever new scandal has thrown them into the spotlight. Whether the issue is big data and profiling, or search results and suggested content, it is the algorithm that gets the blame. But this week Jordan Erica Webber looks into reports that YouTube Kids might create an algorithm-free platform to prevent children viewing inappropriate content by clicking on seemingly benign video suggestions.

          "bodyText": "Each time I scroll down to Netflix’s “Recommendations for Lizzie” feed, my heart sinks in shame. Like a house of black mirrors from a Freudian funfair, it looks like a listicle of romcoms featuring a hapless white lady, with a kind heart and an unfortunate failing, struggling to get it together with the square-jawed-but-equally-flawed male lead. Honestly, it could be a cut-and-paste job from the Wikipedia filmography of Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez or various actors named Ryan. Netflix, in all its machine-learned wisdom, appears to know me better than myself. More than 80% of shows you watch on Netflix are discovered through its recommendations. Maybe I let my mouse hover over The Notebookcorrect for too long, and I am certainly paying the price for clicking on The Christmas Prince (which was, to be fair, a hilarious hot mess both in terms of continuity and constitutionality. As such, I consider my interest to have been at least in part professional and have no regrets).But the personal insight offered by Netflix’s algorithm leaves me cold. You like romcoms? Good for you, no judgment. But I find this feed of saccharine narratives insidious, especially when these films codify gender roles and relationship goals in an infantilising manner. Sure, occasionally I watch them (to be honest, not actually that often, but whatever), however it is definitely not all I want to see. Watching only my Netflix recommendations would be like using the internet only to look at cat pictures: reasonable on one level, but you would undeniably also miss out on some interesting stuff. Netflix’s biggest competitor, according to its CEO, is not other streaming services, but sleep. This observation is both sinister and unintentionally revealing about the quality of its content. But I also get it: by the time I am scrolling around looking for something to watch, I am usually seeking what gambling researchers call “the zone” – a state of wellbeing characterised by a sense of relief and an absence of stress. I just want to tune out, and Netflix has a financial interest in perpetuating that state, uninterrupted, for as long as possible. Escapism is an important component of emotional wellbeing, and thankfully a Netflix binge is less harmful than a gambling addiction. But I would not want Netflix’s bottom line to be a determinant for cultural production and consumption. Consuming culture should be about delight and surprise; it should be comforting and unsettling; it should be thought-provoking and create space for self-reflection. It need not be all of these things at once, but a balanced diet helps us understand each other across social divides and make sense of the human experience. Just as we should resist outsourcing our ethical decisions to machines, we should not allow them to make cultural ones for us either. Encouraging us to make choices about cultural consumption based on path dependency, as the Netflix algorithm does, is not a neutral phenomenon. Maciej Cegłowski has written about how by clicking on recommended links in YouTube, you can end up watching videos about conspiracy theories surprisingly quickly. Using machine learning to keep people hooked on a platform can animate our desire to either escape our emotions, or fuel them – these are two sides of the same coin. Outrage, like escapism can be healthy and appropriate, but coding our online life in ways that are slavish to these emotional states in subtle ways is hardly ideal. It might make platforms a lot of money, but it also degrades our sense of what is possible, and the commonality of human experiences. “By emphasising the individual to an extreme,” Joseph Turow writes in his book Niche Envy“the new niche-making forces are encouraging values that diminish the sense of belonging that is necessary to a healthy civic life. ” Machines make mistakes and engender specific values in ways that are hard to detect when we rely on them to make decisions or recommendations. Now more than ever we must embrace the process of defining our values publicly and collectively, to invite scrutiny into machine learning, to find ways to keep these algorithms accountable and make them more transparent. Until then, I’m steering clear of anything featuring a Ryan or a Jennifer, no matter what Netflix recommends. • Lizzie O’Shea is an Australian human rights lawyer, broadcaster and writer living in London"

          "headline": "Is your friend getting a cheaper Uber fare than you are?",
          "bodyText": "We all know that ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft operate dynamic, or “surge”, pricing: they change their prices in real time, according to supply and demand. But is there something else behind these fluctuations in fees? Is your taxi fare actually being personalized according to how much the company thinks you are willing to pay? I’ve long had the hunch that this might be the case. Partly because I’ve occasionally noticed that I’m being quoted a different price than a friend who happens to call an Uber to the same place at the same time. Other people have had similar observations. They’ve noticed that they get sent 50% off Uber discounts every week, for example, while other people don’t. And one of my friends, Dan, says that when he switches from his personal credit card to his corporate credit card in the Uber app, his quoted price often decreases. “It might have something to do with my kid vomiting in some cabs,” he hypothesizes. There may well be an algorithm that has figured out that dad-Dan is not as desirable a passenger as corporate-Dan, and charges him accordingly. Of course, anecdata doesn’t prove anything and can easily be explained away. Two people getting quoted different prices for the same Uber ride might be due to the fact that Uber’s dynamic pricing algorithm is very sensitive and changes every split-second. However, I find it hard to believe that the likes of Uber and Lyft haven’t experimented with personalizing their prices by analyzing your personal data and figuring out how price-sensitive you are. Personalized pricing, which is also known as price discrimination or price optimization, depending on whether you’re an economist or an online marketer, is a growing trend. According to a recent Deloitte and Salesforce report, 40% of brands that currently use AI to personalize the customer experience have used it to tailor pricing and promotions in real time. More companies are taking advantage of the wealth of customer data they have access to in order to figure out pricing on an individual level. If it seems like someone might be willing to pay more than the reserve price, it makes sense to charge them more than someone who is careful about what they spend. How many companies are currently engaging in practices such as these? “It’s extremely hard to detect so no one really knows,” explains Maurice Stucke, professor of law at the University of Tennessee and co-author of Virtual Competition: The Promise and Perils of the Algorithm-Driven Economy. Information about personalized pricing practices typically “only comes out when there’s a leak, when someone from the inside divulges it”. Companies keep these practices under wraps for a reason: customers don’t want to feel like they’re being charged more than other people. It seems unfair. However, despite all the secrecy there have been a number of well-documented instances of personalized pricing in action. In 2012, for example, a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Staples.com was quoting people different prices based on where they were located. If they lived near a Staples competitor they would get a cheaper price than someone who had no other options near them. Last year, Uber actually went some way to admitting that it had implemented personalized pricing. In an interview with Bloomberg, the company acknowledged that it had a new fare system called “route-based pricing”. This means it calculates people’s propensity to pay more to travel a certain route at a certain time of day, and charge more for that route. Traveling between a fancy neighborhood and a city center during peak commuting hours, for example, might cost a premium rate, because the company expects people will pay for it. While this may not be the purest form of personalized pricing, as Stucke notes, it is “third-degree price discrimination. You’re discriminating against people who fall into certain groups.” When I asked Uber if they practiced personalized pricing, referencing this example, they flatly denied it. The only statement an Uber spokesman would offer was: “We may price routes differently based on our understanding of demand patterns, not individual riders.” This carefully worded answer was, at least, better than Lyft, who didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. There are other clues that Uber et al might be examining your personal data in order to toggle their prices based on your propensity to pay more at a particular moment. In 2016, for example, a behavioral scientist at Uber divulged that the company knew that people were more willing to pay a higher fare when their phone batteries were low. While they said they “absolutely don’t use that” information, one has to wonder why they have a behavioural economist on staff in the first place, if it isn’t to manipulate prices based on people’s behavior. What other data points might Uber be looking at to gauge your price sensitivity? Obvious factors include the sort of credit card you use, where you live, the make of phone you’re using, and your ride history. But, really, we have no idea how much information the likes of Uber know about us and how they are using this data; their privacy policies are incredibly broad. That there is so much mystery around pricing in the ride-share industry is a deeply troubling thing. Not least because the rise of ride-sharing companies is having a negative impact on public transit and deepening inequality. Uber et al are increasingly being used as an alternative to public transit by higher-income people, meaning these systems lose money. We’re in effect seeing the privatization of mass transit. In this scenario it’s incredibly important to monitor price discrimination and ensure it doesn’t turn into other forms of discrimination. A pricing algorithm could very easily start penalizing people who live in poorer neighborhoods, with fewer transport options, for example. “There has to be greater transparency and accountability on the parts of ones who are setting the prices,” Stucke says. “These algorithms really are black boxes. You don’t know how they’re arriving at those prices and whether you’re being discriminated against. Consumers should have the ability to avoid such forms of discrimination if they so choose and have greater ability to protect their anonymity.” With Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal dominating headlines over the last few weeks, it seems like data collection and manipulation by tech companies has finally roused mainstream interest. So let’s not let the story stop at Facebook. Let’s ensure we’re constantly holding all of these tech companies accountable and making sure they’re not shamelessly taking us all for a ride. So, are your friends getting a different fare to you? Why not try this experiment: order the same car for the same route at the same time. If you get differing fares, do send a screenshot our way: US.opinion@theguardian.com"

          "headline": "The compelling Grand National keeps our fragile link with horses alive",
          "bodyText": "In his recent book Farewell to the Horse: the Final Century of our Relationship, the German writer Ulrich Raulff charts what he sees as “the exodus of the horse from human history”. The “separation of man and horse”, Raulff says, “is not only a done deal, it is also a finished process”, and on 364 days of the year, it is hard to argue. There is still a day in April, though, when a horse race in the north-west of England halts the exodus for a few hours at least, and the horse is briefly reinstated in our national consciousness. When the Grand National was founded in the middle of the 19th century, there were 300,000 horses in London alone, to provide transport and heavy labour for a city of three million. The horse was a constant thread in the fabric of daily life for city-dwellers and country folk alike, keeping the country working, eating and moving, so when a Liverpool hotelier called William Lynn decided to stage an event that would pull in a crowd – and hopefully shift a few rooms – a horse race was a natural choice. Two centuries later, Lynn would probably be amazed to find his race still alive and thriving but then, he would doubtless be astonished by jumbo jets, mobile phones and a female prime minister. His world, the world into which the National was born, is long gone, and the internal combustion engine has long since made most working horses redundant. The vast majority of Britons do not encounter a horse from one year to the next. And yet, the Grand National remains as popular as ever. It is an ancient relic which refuses to crumble, or show any sign at all of wear and tear, though inevitably, it has had to adapt to survive. From the Grand National’s earliest days, when the obstacles included a stone wall, and the stream and ditch where Conrad dumped Captain Becher in 1839, it has attracted criticism – rightly, from a 21st-century perspective – for being too severe. The stone wall survived for just a few years but there was still a brook, of sorts, at Becher’s until 1989, when two horses died in the ditch on the landing side of the obstacle. Almost overnight, Becher’s was seen to have failed the test of what spectators would accept as a fair challenge for a horse. The brook was filled in, the landing side was levelled and the race moved on. The National underwent a major change again in 2013, when the solid cores of the fences were replaced with more forgiving plastic. In the last five Nationals, there has been an average of only four fallers per year, and not a single fatal injury to a runner – and this after a miserable run of several years when it did not seem to be a case of whether a horse would be killed in the race but how many. To the National’s millions of once-a-year viewers, the race looks exactly the same, yet once again the challenge has become more attuned to the changing sensibilities of its audience. It is a clever trick – shape-shifting in the cause of self-preservation – but the National also more than pays its way. The 19th century horse race that was conceived to fill rooms at a Liverpool hotel is now a vast and global money-spinner, beyond the wildest fantasies of its founder. The National is one of the biggest draws for television viewers in any sport, and the majority of those tuning in will have placed a bet on the outcome which will in turn feed back into the sport’s funding. Off-course betting in cash was illegal in Britain from 1853 until 1961 but that made no difference. This has always been the one race of the year that could persuade the average, law-abiding citizen to track down a bookmaker. But the National’s greatest strength, the happy gift that has kept it relevant for nearly two centuries, is its unerring ability to deliver on that original promise of spectacle and high drama. Every runner brings a story to Liverpool, often a tale of lifetimes spent working with horses, with just a chance to line up for the National as the ultimate dream. The race takes 40 stories and plays out the final episodes all at once, and the result is the most intensely dramatic and unpredictable 10 minutes of sporting action all year. No algorithm will ever predict the National winner with any certainty, because pure chance takes over when the starter sends them on their way. How could mere maths ever foresee a result like Foinavon’s 100-1 win in 1967 after a pile-up at the smallest fence? And there is also the uncanny way that the National seems to know when it needs the “right” result, an unforgettable story that will remind the once-a-year punters why they fell in love with the race in the first place. But whatever the result, and whether or not you even have a bet, if you join millions in Britain and around the world on Saturday in giving the National 10 minutes of your time, it is unlikely to disappoint. And for as long as the National can maintain its venerable significance in the British sporting calendar, the separation between man and horse will not be entirely complete."

          "headline": "Mark Zuckerberg faces tough questions in two-day congressional testimony – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Zuckerberg got rougher treatment from the House of Representatives than he did from the Senate. While yesterday Zuckerberg was largely able to stick to his script, some of the representatives today pressed hard for information on Facebook’s extensive tracking of users across the internet. Zuckerberg continued his strategy of deflecting questions and downplaying what Facebook does, but his (hopefully? presumably?) feigned ignorance of the core technology that made Facebook into the business it is simply doesn’t hold water. The overall impression I got was that, for all Zuck’s assurances that targeted advertising is “aligned” with Facebook’s “social mission”, the company has no interest in the general public actually knowing and understanding the extent of its ability to track users and amass data profiles of them. Almost every time he mentioned the “control” Facebook gives users over their content, he was avoiding answering a question about information that Facebook collects about users without their knowledge. But don’t just take my word for it. Here is my colleague Alex Hern’s analysis of the hearing. And we’re done! Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of Zuckerberg’s two days of testimony. Cramer says that he has more choice in internet service providers in rural North Dakota than he does for social networking. Zuck: The content reviewers we have aren’t actually in Silicon Valley for the most part. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, is the final representative to speak. Cramer says he was dissatisfied with answers on opioid ads: How quickly could you take down an illegal drug site if there was a million dollar fine attached? Zuck says he’s committed to being more pro-active. Cramer suggests that Facebook build a new headquarters in North Dakota, where the talent pool won’t be so tainted by the Bay Area’s liberal bias. Duncan says that the two biggest issues are privacy and censorship. “Why not have a standard for free speech that is simply a mirror of the first amendment?” he asks. Zuck says terrorist speech could be protected by the first amendment, and that we don’t want it to spread on the internet. Our second to last questioner is Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, who starts off by noting that Facebook is invaluable to him. Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, is asking Zuck what he knows about opioid addictions. After a few minutes on that, he brings up trafficking of ivory in private groups and piracy of movies. Carter gets to his point which is: Hate speech is difficult to figure out, but opioids, ivory trafficking, and movie piracy are not. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania: What pieces of GDPR would be properly placed in American jurisprudence? Should we have right to erasure? Zuck says he agrees with controls, and raises concern about sensitive tech like facial recognition. Costello: Should you be able to deploy AI for facial recognition for a non-Facebook user? Zuck: That’s a good question. Costello: Are you ever a publisher? Zuck: If we commission and fund it, yes. Otherwise, no. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, hits Zuck hard on his apparent ignorance of his company’s basic functions: “As CEO you didn’t know some key facts. You didn’t know about key court cases regarding privacy and your company. You didn’t know that the FTC doesn’t have fining. You didn’t know what a shadow profile is. You don’t know how many apps you need to audit. You don’t know what other companies were sold the Kogan data, even though you were asked that yesterday. You don’t even know how many kinds of information you’re logging.” Dingell is the first to raise Facebook Pixel, another way that Facebook can track browsers across the internet. Dingell asks how many “like” buttons exist in the wilds of the internet? Zuck says he doesn’t know. Dingell asks how many chunks of Pixel code are out there. Zuck doesn’t know. She asks for a 72 hour response. Mimi Walters, a Republican from California, is showing screenshots of Facebook’s privacy settings for apps and photos. She asks, which control governs? Is it the app permissions? Or the user’s decisions? Zuck explains the difference between app permissions and in-line controls on content. Walters suggests this is difficult to understand, and asks why the controls aren’t all in the same place. Zuck says Facebook both keeps the controls in settings and also shows them to people when they are relevant. Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan, asks who the bad actors that inspired Facebook to cut down on API permissions actually were. Zuck says developers who were taking information that wasn’t relevant to their apps. Walberg: Can Facebook guarantee that there will be no bad actors on apps on its platform? Zuck: This is an arms race. Guarantees are difficult. Walberg: Can you assure me that ads and content are not being denied based on specific views? Zuck: Yes, politically. When it comes to “normal political speech”, but not for things like terrorism. If nothing else, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have the full support of Representative Chris Collins. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York, says that it’s very good that we now all know that Facebook doesn’t sell data. Somewhere, a Facebook PR staffer is cracking open a bottle of champagne. Hudson: What’s the difference between hate speech and speech we don’t like? Zuck: It’s complicated. This is an area where society is shifting. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, mentions that he represents many members of the military from Fort Bragg and raises concerns about the national security threat of leaking information about military. Scott Peters, a Democrat from California, asks whether it would make sense for Congress to define privacy in law. Zuck: It’s an interesting question. Peters notes that privacy isn’t a “bottom line issue” for shareholders. “Privacy doesn’t drive profits, and it may interfere with profits.” He asks whether it would help if there were real financial disincentives to violating privacy. Zuck rejects the premise that privacy and profit aren’t necessarily opposed. Peters: What do Europeans get right and wrong about privacy? Zuck: GDPR in general is going to be a very positive step for the internet. Zuck says that Facebook also offers many controls, and says the requirement for more make sense. Peters: What about things they got wrong? Zuck: I need to think about that more. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Okalahoma, is giving Zuckerberg the chance to explain that Facebook has settings and controls that people can use. Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California, is talking about the limitations of the FTC, and suggesting some kind of entity that oversee data privacy, such as a “Digital Consumer Protection Agency”. Zuck repeats his line that he’s not necessarily against regulation, which he’s probably said at least a dozen times over the past two days. Zuckerberg corrects the record on Facebook’s tracking of browser history. He says that the company does temporarily store web logs, but then “converts” that information into “ad interests”, which can be found in the data download. This is referring back to the question of why browser data wasn’t included when users download their data. And we’re back! Susan Brooks, a Republican from Indiana, is up first, and she wants to talk about the recruitment of young people to join terrorist groups on Facebook and other internet platforms. Brooks: You’ve talked about relying on content being reported, but what if no one reports? Zuck: 99% of Isis and Al Qaeda information is flagged by tools before it needs to be flagged. Brooks says that terrorist content still gets out there wants more detail. Zuck: This is a combination of tech and people. He says the team focusing on terrorism has 200 people. We’re taking a quick break! Be back in about 10 minutes. Carndenas brings up legal threats to The Guardian prior to publication. Zuck says that it was a concern over a factual inaccuracy. Cardenas: You only apologized after they published, eh? Zuck: Yes. Tony Cardenas, a Democrat from California, just mentioned that the CEO of Cambridge Analytica stepped down today. Does that solve the problem? Zuck: No. Cardenas: Did you buy data? Zuck: We stopped. Cardenas: But you did it to build your company. Zuck: It was industry standard. Cardenas: But you did it. Zuck: Yes. Earlier in the hearing, Zuckerberg made a surprising statement suggesting that Facebook was looking into “whether there’s something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require stronger action.” A spokesman for Cambridge responds: “We would be surprised if Mr Zuckerberg was only now aware of research at the University of Cambridge looking at what an individual’s Facebook data says about them. Our researchers have been publishing such research since 2013 in major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and these studies have been reported widely in international media. These have included one study in 2015 led by Dr Aleksandr Spectre (Kogan) and co-authored by two Facebook employees. “We wrote to Facebook on 21 March to ask it to provide evidence to support its allegations about Dr Kogan. We have yet to receive a response.” Joe Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts: Does Facebook include deleted data in what is available for advertisers to target? Zuck: No. Kennedy: Can advertisers get access to metadata, such as tracking on other websites? Zuck: I don’t understand the question. Kennedy: Do advertisers get access to information that the user doesn’t necessarily know is being collected? There’s information that is generated that people don’t realize they are generating. Zuck: The targeting options are generally based on things that people choose to share. But Facebook also does its own work to decide who to show ads to, based on our metadata, but that’s different from letting advertisers use it. Kennedy: The rub is that I don’t think this works with the idea that users “own” their data. Larry Buschon, a Republican from Indiana, is now bringing up the concern about Facebook listening to people’s conversations. He mentions that he had a conversation with his mother about a deceased relative, and later that night, Facebook showed her a memorial video of the relative. He asks whether Facebook is contracting with someone else to listen in. Zuck again says that Facebook is not listening to audio. Buchshon says it’s pretty clear to him that someone is listening. He asks whether Facebook executives bring their phones into confidential meetings. Zuck says they do, and says that often these surprising ad experiences are a coincidence or a result of other online activity. Here’s a good explanation of how Facebook knows so much about you without necessarily listening to you from the Wall Street Journal. Schrader is asking again about being tracked while logged out, and Zuck gives the same basic answer that it’s for “security”. Schrader: Aren’t you complicit in the sale of data by third-parties? Zuck: Well we prohibit that. Schrader: But all I’ve heard so far is that you complain, not that there’s any enforcement. Zuck: Yeah, we’re going to be more proactive now. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon, wants to make sure that Facebook’s audit team doesn’t destroy evidence if it finds still-existing versions of the Kogan/CA data. Zuck says he doesn’t think they’ve deleted anything yet, and notes that the Facebook auditors stood down to let the UK ICO conduct its investigation first. Long: Congress does nothing, or it overreacts. We’re getting ready to overreact. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri: “If we invited everyone that has read your terms of service, we could probably fit them at that table.” Long also says that his constituents aren’t upset about the Cambridge Analytica. Then he asks, What is FaceMash and does it still exist? Zuckerberg: It was a prank website, I took it down. He mentions there was a movie about this, but that the movie was of “unclear truth”. He also again invokes the “dorm room” origins of FaceMash, which in this case I guess is meant to make us understand that nothing that came out of Zuck’s dorm room is that important. David Loebsack, a Democrat from Iowa, asks if it would be possible for Facebook to exist if it didn’t collect and sell data. Zuck quibbles with “selling data” but basically says no, we wouldn’t exist if we weren’t collecting information that people share with us. Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio: Often times technology folks spend all their time focusing on what they can do, instead of what they should do. This is the Jurassic Park question. Here’s the pertinent scene. Clarke: When Mr Kogan sold Facebook data, did he violate Facebook’s policies? Zuck: Yes Clarke: When the Obama app collected data, did they violate Facebook’s policies? Zuck: No Yvette Clarke, a Democrat from New York, starts by mentioning a new technology accountability caucus in Congress, then mentions the way that racism was exploited in the Russian election ads. She asks whether the lack of diversity and “lack of culturally competent personal in your C-suite” contributed to Facebook’s inability to recognize this kind of content. Zuck says that the issue wasn’t a lack of diversity, but that they were too slow to recognize the influence operation. Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, returns to opioid advertisements. Zuck says that FB will take down ads that are flagged for them. Talks about building AI tools that can do this automatically at some point in the future. It’s worth noting that a) Facebook cannot solve the opioid crisis and b) artificial intelligence is not magic, is often not even that intelligent and will not cure all ills on Facebook. Tonko: What liability should Facebook have? Do you bear the liability for the misuse of people’s data? Zuck: We take responsibility. Tonko: What about liability though? Zuck: Non-sequitur about changes to platform API permissions made in 2015. Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York, wants to talk more about Facebook tracking users across the internet and why browser data isn’t in the data download. Zuck again says that if it’s not in the data download, Facebook doesn’t have it. Here’s Alex Hern on the back and forth over “shadow profiles”: Lujan’s line of questioning was important, and Zuckerberg was not candid. But the next questioner, Morgan Griffith, is giving Zuck a chance to talk about expanding broadband access to rural areas. Lujan: How many data points does Facebook have on each user? Zuck: Not sure. Lujan: “You’re collecting data about people who are not even on Facebook... People who don’t even have an account have to sign up for an account to get their data.” Ben Lujan, a Democrat from New Mexico, is telling Zuck that the feature that Facebook said last week that it was turning off because it was allowing “malicious actors” to scrape personal data was actually brought to Facebook’s attention in 2013, and again in 2015. Kinzinger is now bringing up fake accounts that use his picture to “extort people for money”. Zuck: Long term the solution is to build more AI tools that can recognize patterns. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, asks what kind of data Facebook shares with the Russian government or intelligence agencies. Zuckerberg: “In general we are not in the business of providing a lot of data to the Russian government.” Facebook puts out a transparency report each year with details on government requests for information around the world. Zuck notes that Facebook doesn’t store any data inside Russia – a point of contention with the Russian government which has threatened to block internet companies that don’t store data locally. Welch: Do you believe consumers have a right to correct or delete personal data that companies have? Zuck: That would be an interesting debate. Peter Welch, the Democrat from Vermont: This was foreseeable and inevitable and we, Congress, did nothing about it. David McKinley, a Republican from West Virginia, is bringing up online sales of opioids. “Opioids are still available on your site, without a prescription.” McKinley shows screenshots of postings offering opioids for sale. Zuck: Let me just speak to this for a second. McKinley: No. Your platform is still being used to circumvent the law and allow people to buy highly addictive drugs without a prescription. Facebook is enabling illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people. Zuck: There are a number of ways that we need to do a better job of content review. McKinley: You’re still allowing people to get this scourge that is ravaging this country. When are you going to take down these posts that are done with illegal digital pharmacies. Zuck: When people report the post we will taken them down. McKinley: What about those 20,000 people you’re hiring? Where is your accountability in this? Zuck: We need to build better AI tools. Jerry McErney, a Democrat from Stockton, is asking why browsing history is not included in the Facebook data download. Zuck says Facebook doesn’t have browsing history, but he is carefully caging his response within the confines of “your content”. McErney says he wants to follow up on this. If you want to learn more about the backstory to Representatie Castor’s line of questioning on the information Facebook gathers and uses to build a profile of you that, here’s a great report by Gizmodo’s Kasmir Hill, “How Facebook Figures Out Everyone You’ve Ever Met.” John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland: Is it true the Facebook offered dedicated embeds to both campaigns? Zuck: We offer sales support. Sarbanes: I reject your quibbling with my language. I want copies of the exact agreement and offers you made to both campaigns. Sarbanes is speculating that Facebook embeds with the campaigns granted special approval rights to allow them to get approval for 90x more ads than Clinton did. Zuck says that didn’t happen. The Trump campaign did run many more types of advertisements, but that has generally been assumed to be down to a difference in campaign strategy. Sarbanes: The question is are we the people going to regulate our political discourse or are you Mark Zuckerberg going to do it? Zuckerberg admits to Brett Guthrie that most people don’t use their privacy controls. He says this is probably because they like getting “relevant” ads. That’s one hypothesis, but we’ve also talked extensively over the past two days about how confusing it is to try to navigate these labyrinthine controls. Zuckerberg’s unwillingness to admit exactly what Facebook does to collect data gives the lie to his stated belief in the business model’s “alignment” with Facebook’s “social mission”. If you’re so ashamed of what you’re doing, maybe you should stop? Castor: “You are collecting personal information on people who don’t even have accounts, yes or no.” Zuck: mumbles vaguely Castor: Yes you are. You’re collecting data on what people are purchasing, yes? Zuck: If they share it with us. Castor: You’ve patented applications that can do this. Zuck: mumbles a little Castor: You’re collecting medical data, yes? Zuck: Yes some. Castor: What about collecting data on users physical location? Zuck: Let’s talk about “control”. Castor: Nope. Zuck: People choose to share data. Castor: Yeah, maybe that’s the primary way you get data, but not the only way. You buy data from data brokers right? Zuck: We announced two weeks ago we would end that relationship. Castor: I don’t believe the controls you have are a substitute for fundamental privacy protections. [drops mic] Kathy Castor: “I think a devil’s bargain has been struck. Americans do not like to be manipulated. We don’t like to be spied on.... Facebook has now evolved to a place where you are tracking everyone.” Zuck says that Facebook was trying to balance “two equities” - data portability and data protection. “We didn’t get that right.” Lance: Do you believe that the Kogan app harvest violated the FTC consent decree? Zuck: No, but we take a “broader view”. Zuck says again that Kogan selling the data was a violation of his agreement with Facebook. Lance says he believes it was a violation of the consent decree. Leonard Lance, a Republican from New Jersey, is starting us up again by talking about taking deep “offense” with censorship of conservative speech, though he says that he would care about censoring liberal speech too. Zuck says that Facebook makes censorship mistakes against liberals too! Facebook is an equal opportunity mistake-maker. And we’re back! Looks like Zuckerberg took his notes with him when he left the room this time. Fool me once. Here’s my colleague Alex Hern with a brief tweet storm on how disingenuous Zuckerberg’s statements about “owning” your data are. Zuck: We use the data that people put into the system in order to make them more relevant. Whenever the going gets tough, Zuck tends to fall back on a couple of lines: You have complete control over your data; You don’t have to share anything with us. He is certainly having a rougher go of it today, as the interlocutors have less patience for his talking points and diversions. We’re taking a five minute recess. Doris Matsui: To me if you own something, you ought to be able to control how it is used. Matsui talks about the difference between content users share and assumptions algorithms have made about those users – the “virtual self” that Blackburn described. Zuck: I believe people own their content. If I take a photo of you and share it with you, who owns the data? Zuck says he would take the position that it’s “our” photo. Matsui says: Ok but what about data brokers? Matsui: “We might own our own data, but once it’s used in advertising we lose over control of it, isn’t that right?” Zuck: I disagree because we don’t sell the data. Gregg Harper, Republican from Mississippi: If Cambridge Analytica had developed the app themselves, they would have had access to the same data, correct? Zuck: Yes. Harper asks about the Obama 2012 app. Zuck says that the big difference is that people signed into Kogan’s app and then he turned around and sold the data in violation of Facebook’s terms. It is certainly different for people to log into an explicitly political app (Obama 2012) and had that data used for politics, than it is for people to log into a fun psychology app and have that used for politics. But important questions have been raised about whether Zuckerberg’s line that what Kogan did was actually a violation of Facebook’s terms. Butterfield: I was looking at your website, and your leadership team does not reflect America. He notes the five top people are all white. Zuck: We have a broader leadership than just five people Butterfield: Not on your website! Butterfield asks for a committment to add an African American person to the top leadership tier? Zuck demurs. Butterfield asks for data on retention of black employees. Zuck says he’ll talk to his team. GK Butterfield, Democrat from North Carolina, brings up Facebook and tech’s lack of diversity, noting that he talks about this with Sheryl Sandberg. “Will you commit to personally convene a meeting of CEOs in your sectors to develop a strategy to increase racial diversity in your industry?” Zuck: That’s a good idea we’ll follow up on. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is talking about censorship of religious and conservative publishers on Facebook. She quotes Facebook’s head of news partnerships. Zuckerberg says that he doesn’t know who that person is. It’s Campbell Brown. Schakowsky wants to know whether Facebook’s adoption of GDPR will include extending the “rights” that European gets in addition to the “controls”. Zuck doesn’t really answer. She ends with an unanswered question: “Who is going to protect us from Facebook?” Schakowsky: How many other companies did Kogan sell the data to? And what are their names? Zuck says he’ll follow up, and that there are “a handful” of companies who got it. Yesterday he named Eunoia as one of them. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, is reading a list of Zuckerberg’s many, many apologies, dating back to his pre-Facebook Harvard days. Schakowsky: “This is proof to me that self-regulation simply does not work.” Robert Latta, Republican from Ohio: Why didn’t the audits that you had to submit under the FTC consent decree find these problems? Zuck: I think the broader question here is that we’ve had the FTC consent decree but we have a broader view of our responsibility. Zuck says he doesn’t believe Kogan’s actions violated the consent decree, but was a breach of trust. Zuckerberg’s answers on questions about the FTC consent decree are basically incoherent. Doyle is now reading parts of the consent decree, including details which Zuckerberg says he’s not fully familiar with. Doyle is excoriating on Zuckerberg’s flouting his own standards and users’ trust. Zuck pulls out his line for an “attack”: “I respectfully disagree.” Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is the first person I’ve heard so far to mention The Guardian’s reporting! His point is: Do you normally learn about abuses from the press? It seems as though you turned a blind eye. Zuck: I disagree with that assessment... Doyle: It seems like you were more concerned with attracting developers than you were with protecting users. Steve Scalise, the majority whip: You said that there is data mining when a user is logged off for security purposes. Is that data also used for the business model? Zuck: I believe the ad data is separate from the security data, but he’s not sure. Scalise: Are the people who made a mistake with Diamond and Silk going to be punished? Zuck says he’ll follow up. Now Scalise is mentioning a study that says news feed has conservative bias. Who designs the algorithm, he asks? Was there a directive to put in a bias? Zuck: There is no directive in any of the changes we make to have bias. Scalise says: Please look and see if there is actually bias though. Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado, is talking through the fact that Facebook is hugely valuable, and that its business hasn’t really suffered from the current controversy. Now she’s going through various class-action lawsuits against Facebook that didn’t result in users getting any money. She is pushing him hard on not knowing the details of these issues, such as whether or not there was any financial penalty for the FTC consent decree (there wasn’t). Her point, which she’s getting to now, is that there’s no financial hazard for Facebook to continue in bad behavior. Blackburn: Do you subjectively change your algorithms to prioritize or censor speech? Zuck: We don’t think of it as censorship. We remove terrorist content. Blackburn: Diamond and Silk are not terrorists. The hearing today is quite a bit punchier than yesterday’s. These representatives have much less patience for Zuck’s talking points and stalling. Blackburn calls Zuckerberg out for filibustering her questions. Marsha Blackburn: Your cozy community is starting to look like the Truman Show... Who owns the “virtual you”? Who owns your presence online? Is it you or is them? Zuck: I believer everyone owns their own content online. Gene Green: If I download my Facebook data, is there other stuff that you guys still have, like browser activity or inferences Facebook draws about people? Zuckerberg: I believe that all of your information is in that file. Gene Green, a Democract from Texas, is asking about GDPR. Zuck says everyone will have the same privacy controls. Burgess asks whether Facebook is sharing its internal audits with the FTC. Zuck appears to short out for a moment, then says he doesn’t totally understand the question. Asked about third-party app permissions, Zuck again brings up in-line controls to limit the audience of an individual post. This is not only a non-sequitur, it is (as I’ve been screaming inside my head all morning) a willful obfuscation of what actually happens on Facebook. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas: Would the average consumer be able to evaluate the terms and conditions they see on third-party app permissions? Zuck: “I think if someone wanted to know they could.” Engel: Do you adjust your algorithms to prevent people interested in violence from other likeminded people? Zuck says yes, that’s something we need to do, which doesn’t necessarily sound like it’s something that they already do. Here’s an article I wrote last year about how extremists come together through Facebook groups. Eliot Engel: You said Facebook was deceived by Kogan. Does Facebook plan to sue Kogan, Cambridge University, or Cambridge Analytica? Zuckerberg: It’s something we’re looking into. We already took action by banning him from the platform. Zuck says they need to understand whether “something bad” is going on at Cambridge University, since they apparently just learned about the Psychometrics Center, whose work was the inspiration for Kogan’s data scrape. Shimkus is asking for clarification on tracking when users are logged off, and tracking across devices. Zuck: We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. “Just because someone chose to make something public doesn’t mean that it’s good for someone to aggregate it.” Zuck is conceding that the ad network is collecting information across other websites, which he notes that Google does as well. John Shimkus: Who is conducting the audit? Zuck: We’re starting with an internal investigation, will move on to third-party auditors later. Eshoo is trying unsuccessfully to get Zuckerberg to deviate from his memorized talking points about the Kogan/CA breach. He simply will not answer her questions as they are posed. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California, is asking a series of questions from her constituents. Do you think you have a moral obligation to run a platform that protects democracy? Zuck: Yes. Was your personal data included in the CA breach? Zuck: Yes. Are you willing to change your business model in the interest of protecting individual privacy? Zuck: I’m not sure what that means. Upton is now bringing up an advertisement that a local Michigan politician tried to run on Facebook but that was rejected. The ad language sounds like boilerplate Republican positions. Zuck says he doesn’t know what happened there. Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, is asking whether it’s possible to craft regulation that won’t stifle startups. Zuck: I think it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation, but you have to be careful about what it is. Bobby Rush: Why is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy? Zuckerberg is not going to move off his line that users can limit the audience of their posts. Rush moves on to Facebook’s reported violations of civil rights law forbidding discriminatory advertising. Bobby Rush: You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy. What is the difference between Facebook’s methodology and the methodology of American political pariah J Edgar Hoover? Zuck: On Facebook, you have control over your information. The content you share, you put there. Says that no other surveillance operation gives you the ability to opt out. Barton: Is there any reason why we should have rules of no data sharing for Facebook users under 18? Zuck: We have a number of measures in place to protect minors... The reality that we see is that teens often do want to share their opinions publicly. Zuck is again talking about the ability to limit the audience of shared content, not about the targeted advertising to children based on data Facebook gathers about them. Joe Barton is asking why Diamond and Silk were censored on Facebook. Zuck says it was a mistake. Here’s a Washington Post article about the conservative sisters. Pallone asks if Facebook limits the type of data it collects and uses. Zuck says they do, but Pallone says he doesn’t see how. Pallone: Is Facebook changing user default settings? Zuck says yes, that they’ve changed the way that developers can get access to data, which is not the question. Pallone: Will you change all user default settings to minimize to the greatest extent possible all the user data? Yes or no. Zuck says that he won’t give a one word answer. Scratch that: Zuckerberg is explaining that Facebook doesn’t sell data despite Walden’s statement that he understands that fact. Walden is foreclosing Zuck’s canned response that Facebook doesn’t technically sell data, arguing that it does monetize it, and stating that data might be the only thing of true value that Facebook does have. Walden: You can send money on Facebook. Are you a financial company? Zuck: Nah. Walden notes that Facebook is increasingly broadcasting original television content: Is Facebook a media company? Zuckerberg: I consider us to be a technology company. Zuckerberg is still saying that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica misused or improperly obtained data, despite Senator Blumenthal’s release of the terms of service yesterday, which appeared to show that he did have permission to share, sell, and transfer the data. Zuckerberg is now making his opening statement. If this sounds familiar, it’s because he’s reading the same words he read yesterday, in his opening statement at the Senate hearing. Pallone: “We need comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation.” Frank Pallone, the ranking Democrat, is now making his opening statement, noting that Facebook is ubiquitous, and most of us are locked in. “For all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for groups like Russia and Cambridge Analytica,” he says. Walden is already showing a stronger grasp of the distinction between data users consciously share and data Facebook collects than many of the senators had yesterday. Zuckerberg is seated and we’re getting started. Commitee chairman Greg Walden is kicking us off with an opening statement. “While Facebook has surely grown, I worry it has not matured.” While we are waiting for today’s hearing to get underway, let’s look back at a fun little parable of privacy from yesterday: the tale of Mark Zuckerberg’s notes. During one of the short breaks during yesterday’s hearing, Zuck left a copy of his typed notes open on the table. When he left the room, reporters pounced. An AP photo of the talking points went viral, as reporters and Facebook critics pored over the text for the merest shred of red meat. Some of the tidbits were legitimately interesting; others merely titillating. We now know how Zuck was prepared to respond to attacks (“Respectfully, I reject that”), that he was prepared to respond to calls for his resignation, and that he needed a bold-faced reminder that Facebook is not already compliant with forthcoming European data privacy standards. But what should we call what happened with the notes? Was this a breach of Zuckerberg’s privacy? Or did he, by leaving the information unprotected in a public space, “share” that information with us? And is there any meaningful recourse after information that was intended for a limited audience is taken out of context and shared with an entirely different audience? Welcome to our second day of live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the US Congress. Yesterday, Zuckerberg was questioned by 44 senators from two committees in a five-hour joint session. This morning, he returns to Capitol Hill to face the House committee on energy and commerce, starting at 10am EDT. The Senate hearing may have been a marathon, but Zuckerberg was rarely forced to break a sweat. Senators trying to press him on Facebook’s unprecedented collection and use of personal data were tripped up by semantics and technical details, providing the 33-year-old executive with the opportunity to deflate and deflect many lines of questioning. Today, we’ll be watching to see if any representatives are able to break Zuckerberg’s talking points filibuster on the data that fuels Facebook’s advertising machine – or wring out new details about the company’s relationships with the Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, his company GSR, and the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. For our full report on yesterday’s proceedings, check out Washington DC bureau chief David Smith’s write up here. Or if you’d like to read my thoughts on Facebook’s greatest achievement in artificial intelligence, you can find my analysis. We’ll have a live coverage here as today’s session unfolds."

          "headline": "What's the ​best way to get written out of history? Be a middle-aged woman",
          "bodyText": "History erases the contribution of middle-aged women. It takes a lot of time, but that’s fine, because that’s what history’s good at. “How the devil did they get away with that,” you might think, looking at a magazine cover’s lineup of the architects of the Good Friday agreement that is entirely male, and doesn’t include Mo Mowlam. “What happened to the women who actually broke this story,” you possibly wonder, surveying an all-male panel called upon to discuss the finer details of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not the next day, but some time soon the airbrush will have come for Theresa May, Angela Merkel and Sheryl Sandberg, and we will be confused, unable to understand how Brexit meant Brexit, or the euro survived, or who taught Mark Zuckerberg how to open his mouth in the manner of a person smiling. In fact, all social movements of any importance were started by middle-aged women, and there’s a solid case-by-case reason why we have forgotten them all. The Fight the Famine Committee, after the first world war, began in the house of Catherine Courtney in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, but that’s right on the corner of the road where Margaret Thatcher was coached in public speaking to get rid of her high, grating (cough “female”) voice and make her sound like a story tape on a Sony Walkman that was running out of batteries (this reference is aimed purely at middle-aged women). So already I can’t remember who destroyed the industrial heartlands, and who started the organisation that became Save the Children, which was run by two sisters, though unfortunately they are lost to the mists of time, because one of them had a funny name (Eglantyne Jebb) and the other one didn’t (Dorothy Buxton). The temperance movement was driven by women, but we let ourselves be written out of that because it gave us a bad name. The highly fruitful school of thought connecting poverty to infant mortality, and perhaps more radically still, holding infant mortality to be a bad thing, was developed by the anarcho-socialists Maud Pember Reeves and Charlotte Wilson in the early 20th century (in fact, Pember Reeves was the socialist and Wilson the anarchist but these things sound more authentically middle-aged when you mash them together). The background to their work was the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which found poverty to be morally driven, exacerbated by do-gooders giving food and relief to poor people, which only incentivised them to be more poor. Pember Reeves and Wilson discovered, with close and what we would now call “embedded” research into the respectable poor, that the children of highly moral ones were also dying in large numbers before they reached the age of 10. You can see why this would be easier to erase than to commemorate. The abolitionists Hannah More and Elisabeth Jesser Reid were forgotten because they were basically doing the same thing as William Wilberforce, and he had that pretty alliteration going on with his name. Mary Prince, a campaigner, author and former slave, got a commemorative plaque in Camden in 2007, so that’s OK. Sarah Parker Remond, another woman of colour working internationally against slavery in the 1850s, had a more famous brother, which is a near-failsafe way to get yourself written out of history. Shall I use my cloak of invisibility to fight crime, or for evil? That’s the question I ask, upon turning 44. Fortunately, it won’t be remembered either way, and the world is our plaything. Don’t believe the sockpuppets The internet causes a lot of cognitive dysfunction. We all know that because we read it on the internet, but sometimes the details get lost because you see the word “dysfunction” and think: “No, this could not possibly mean me.” The “epistemic bubble” is when you no longer read anything that you don’t already agree with. Nobody enters any bubble on purpose, it is just the natural consequence of getting all your news from sources – friends, relatives, colleagues – whose views chime with your own. It’s a dicey premise – that any of us agree with our colleagues, let alone our relatives – but just take it on trust. The “echo chamber” is where you sometimes hear information you don’t like, but you disbelieve it on that basis. This happens to me all the time, but I am often right and the information turns out to be untrue. No algorithm has yet been found to deal with the fact that just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get you. Astroturfing, where a couple of troll-bots dress themselves up as a wider political movement, and sockpuppet accounts, where you create a social media profile to say the things the real you can’t, is something I’m not prepared to adopt until alternative, serviceable words are found for actual AstroTurf and actual sockpuppets. One under-reported category is the bastard-filter, where every story you hear about your opponents leads you to believe they are complete and irredeemable bastards. I am thinking about the story alleging that Conservative canvassers were flung out of a pub in west London this week for having a meeting about how to “spin Grenfell”, but that was one of 10 bastard-filter stories that day. The Conservatives categorically deny it, but the inertia and misanthropy have set in. One day, when I work out how, I’m going to invent a bastard blocker. Only my friends, relatives and colleagues will ever see it, but that’s OK, because we will agree that we’re happier. Marx her words This is a full but not exhaustive list of Karl Marxes, as they exist in the common consciousnethere’s the Conservatives’ Marx, who personally escorted Russians in their millions to gulags, while laughing; the economists’ Marx, who invented the law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit, which may or may not be correct; and the historico-literary Marx, shifting our gaze mildly away from individual agency, towards underlying structural causes. And now, Karen Pierce, UK ambassador to the UN’s Marx, who would be turning in his grave to see the actions of Vladimir Putin, because obviously, the Russian Federation is the same as the USSR, and a kleptocratic autocracy was definitely what Marx had in mind when he wrote Das Kapital. You could rewrite all philosophy in emojis, and it couldn’t get any less sophisticated."

          "headline": "Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook hearing was an utter sham",
          "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room – and on Twitter – was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions! Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse. Each senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates’ hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can’t do a hearing of this magnitude in just a couple of hours. The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don’t care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads or privacy laws or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher king whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn’t. Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people’s data, enabled foreign propaganda and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn’t be begging for Facebook’s endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg’s promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy and demand our senators get a real hearing. The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. “Your user agreement sucks,” said John Kennedy. “Are you a monopoly?” asked Lindsey Graham. (Zuckerberg “comically” responded: “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me.”) Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies. Because each senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg tried to run the clock by talking about mission, philosophy or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot. Senators Mazie Hirono and Cory Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProPublica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them. The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it could easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn’t want to. Hirono and Booker could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were “important” or “interesting” or “an important conversation to have”. Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad – or bizarre – political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn’t make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly; it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, such as how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treats him as a thought leader. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits. In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to – at a minimum – move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability. But that’s not enough. There is so much we don’t know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don’t know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples. Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes. The real hearing would allow for unlimited questions from each of our senators, who represent millions of people. If it takes two months of sitting in Washington DC, let it take two months. This is our democracy. Zephyr Teachout is an American academic, political activist and former political candidate"

          "bodyText": "It’s tough being beautiful. Other women, women who are not so genetically blessed, despise you, you see. They worry you will steal their husband. They get together with their average-looking friends and say nasty things behind your inordinately elegant back. They think that, just because you have flawless skin, you don’t have feelings. But you do have feelings: tragically, the world can’t look past your cut-glass cheekbones and understand that. If you have ever wondered What It’s Like to Go Through Life As a Really Beautiful Woman, this is about the sum of it, apparently. At least, according to an article published last week on New York magazine’s lifestyle website, the Cut. In it, an anonymous woman in her late 50s explains that being attractive opened a lot of doors for her in life, but also made women hate her. I’m fairly sure the beautiful-but-damned subject of the article wasn’t Samantha Brick, but it is very much reminiscent of her infamous 2012 magnum opus in the Daily Mail, There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful. And, like Brick’s much-laughed-at lament, it was immediately and mercilessly mocked on social media. Rightly so. The article reads like a parody, parroting tiresome tropes about jealous, catty women. Yet it’s a shame the response to the piece descended so swiftly into jeers. There is an interesting and important conversation to be had about what it’s like to go through life as a really beautiful woman – or a very handsome man. Looks aren’t everything, but count for a lot. We might not like to admit it, but we are all prone to treating people differently according to their appearance. Studies show that even babies prefer looking at more attractive faces. But while we are all affected by beauty biases, I’m not sure we are often prompted to examine and curb them – and they have real repercussions. Mostly, those repercussions are stacked in favour of attractive people. “Pretty privilege” kicks in at a young age: research has found that teachers, both at school and university, consider better-looking students to be more intelligent, giving them better grades and more attention. The same is true in the workplace, where, numerous studies say, it pays to be good looking. According to one economist, attractive people are likely to earn 3% to 4% more than someone with below-average looks; the equivalent of $230,000 (£163,000) over a lifetime. But while beauty mainly seems to be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Being considered attractive works against you if you are a woman applying for a traditionally “masculine” job, for example. In 2015, a study from University College London’s School of Management found that while handsome men are seen as more competent, this makes them less likely to be hired in competitive workplaces because they are perceived as a threat. Funny, isn’t it? Despite there being clear evidence that men can be threatened by other men’s looks, they are rarely accused of same-sex jealousy in the way women are. It is almost as if society goes out of its way to pit women against each other. Ultimately, it seems that the main problem with being attractive is that people are not allowed to complain about it. As articles like the one in the Cut make clear, nothing brings out the sarcastic tiny violins faster than someone moaning about the pitfalls of aesthetic perfection. While that may be understandable, I think it is also worth understanding that society sometimes penalises prettiness. Let’s not be so quick to hate on people just because they write op-eds about being beautiful. Zuck goes to charm school It’s a big week for Mark Zuckerberg, who is appearing in front of Congress to apologise for inadvertently undermining democracy. Facebook reportedly prepared for this personal responsibility (PR) exercise by bringing in an army of experts to give its CEO a “crash course” in charm – a quality the ZuckBot is not known for. What does this charm curriculum comprise? If I happened to control a complex system of mass surveillance or was as good at hacking as certain Tory MPs, I would be able to tell you in detail. Sadly, this is not the case. So, I can only speculate that preparations kicked off with careful scrutiny of the personal data of all the politicians Zuck will be meeting. People like it when you ask them about themselves, Mark! Why not try asking that congressman – you know, the one who has been having a secret affair for the past three months – how he liked the new carbonara recipe he tried the other day? Facebook being Facebook, I imagine some fancy tech was involved in updating MZ’s interpersonal operating system. An empathy algorithm, perhaps, devised to recommend meaningful semantic structures that build a sense of genuine community. Or maybe there is proprietary communication code that prompts Zuckerberg to nod and say “yes” at regular intervals to make it seem as if he is actually listening and not just counting the minutes until he can escape from having to interact with mere mortals. Or maybe charm training was a little more analogue than that. Perhaps Zuckerberg was just advised to take off that unflattering T-shirt and wear a suit. Perhaps he was told to say the word “sorry” a statistically significant number of times. After all, if you repeat any old nonsense long enough, people will believe it. Facebook knows that better than just about anyone. Everything you’ve never wanted to know about animal emissions One day you tweet a question about whether snakes fart, the next you’ve landed a book deal about animal flatulence. Well, Dani Rabaiotti knows how it is, anyway. Last year, the environmental scientist sent a tweet that turned into a viral hashtag (#doesitfart) that turned into a book called Does It Fart: the Definitive Field Guide to Animal Flatulence. This includes must-know information such as the fact that sloths don’t break wind. Meanwhile, seal farts smell like fish, while herrings use their liberated gas to communicate with each other, much like small children. The book only came out in the US last week, but it was released in Britain last year. I guess the UK is inordinately receptive to hot air."

          "bodyText": "My poll card for the local elections, which take place across England in May, arrived in the post this week. The last one came in April 2016, for London’s mayoral election, and receiving it made me jump for joy. EU law gives every European citizen a vote in local and European elections wherever they live in the European Union. In April 2016 I had just moved to the UK, which I always dreamed of calling home, and was so proud that I took a selfie with my card. Two more UK polls came after that – a referendum that changed everything, and a general election that changed very little – but I could not vote in either, because I am a European national. And now, with Brexit looming, the polling card is just another gloomy reminder of how different things were for EU citizens just two years ago. About 3.7 million EU citizens live in the UK. After 23 June 2016, they experienced loss in various ways. Some were verbally abused, some fell out with leave-voting friends, or struggled to answer their children’s questions about having to leave the country. Many tell me about their constant anxiety over their situation. All speak of anger – at the government, at the leave campaign, at a country they don’t recognise. After the referendum, it took a year for the UK government to announce the “settled status” for EU citizens, and another year has passed since without the guarantee that it will be implemented smoothly (3.7 million applications is an awful lot to process) and equally (according to the 3 Million rights group, the registration system has “an error rate of 10% and a rejection rate of 27%”). And of course, “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, which means losing everything overnight if the deal falls apart. EU citizens don’t want to think about Brexit all the time, but it pollutes our lives in insidious ways. I have received leaflets targeted at “bargaining chips”. I open Department for Work and Pensions letters with a knot in my stomach, because they may ask for an update about my situation after 2019. I’ve caught myself anticipating questions about Brexit with jokes like, “I’m probably going to get deported anyway!” I visit France more often, because it’s relaxing to know there will be no Brexit talk on the radio that may question my presence there. I say “I’m going home” when flying from, and not to, Stansted. This week, an advert sponsored by the UK government showed up on my Facebook feed. It read: “EU citizens in the UK. Stay informed.” It keeps popping up, more often than ads for contraceptives, which bombard women my age online. I suppose Facebook’s algorithm considers me EU citizen first and woman second. In such a climate, EU nationals cannot afford not to have a contingency plan. Tens of thousands have already left the country, with net EU migration falling to its lowest levels since 2012. A year from now, many more will be gone, and I may be one of them. I do not meet the five-year threshold for settled status, so I can only apply for a temporary permit until I have been here five years, and apply again. I will have to pay, and may be rejected, both times. No EU citizen is relaxed about the year ahead. Some, like me, don’t meet that threshold. Or they may not qualify because they cannot prove five consecutive years of employment, like carers, stay-at-home parents and freelancers. Some have non-EU partners whose UK visas depend on them. Some have family who could not move abroad because of language barriers, or would have to apply for another EU citizenship before doing so. Some don’t have transferable jobs, or own a business in the UK, or can’t afford to leave the country. Some have ageing family here. Some don’t have access to a computer to register when the process opens or simply don’t know that they have to do it. My poll card is the first tangible proof of the rights I still enjoy in the UK, since the referendum result that gave them an expiry date. On 3 May, I will exercise my right to participate in this democracy, and then, eventually, I will leave to regain that right somewhere else. Because nothing is agreed until everything is, and enough is enough. • Pauline Bock is a French freelance journalist based in the UK. She writes for the New Statesman"

          "bodyText": "Like Sarah Connor, I was born around 1965. But unlike Sarah Connor, I don’t plan on saving the world from killer robots. That’s something we all have to do. How we will do this doesn’t involve time travel. Or any rocket science. We simply have to agree that building machines that decide who lives or dies is morally unacceptable. The killer robots I’m talking about aren’t T101 Terminator robots. It’s stupid AI that I’m most worried about. They are much simpler technologies that are just a few years away. Think of the drones that we see above the skies of Afghanistan or Iraq. These are only semi-autonomous weapons. Such a drone can fly itself most of the time but a soldier still makes the final life or death decision to fire its Hellfire missile. It is, however, a small technical leap to replace that soldier by a computer. The UK’s ministry of defence claim this is possible today. I would agree. And the BAE Systems Taranis drone is a prototype of this future that has been flying now for several years. How then do we prevent a future full of killer robots? The technologies that go into a fully autonomous drone are going to be invented. They are pretty much the same technologies that go into autonomous cars. An algorithm that identifies, tracks and avoids pedestrians can easily be changed to identify, track and target combatants. And unlike nuclear weapons, autonomous weapons are going to be cheap and eventually very effective weapons. The arms companies of the world will make a killing (pun very much intended) selling autonomous weapons to all sides of every conflict. Cheap. Effective. And easily available. This hardly sounds like a good recipe for a ban. However, there’s a good historical precedent that suggests we can be hopeful. Chemical weapons are cheap just like autonomous weapons will be. And like autonomous weapons, chemical weapons use technologies that are widely available and impossible to ban. Now, while we didn’t ban chemistry, we did ban chemical weapons. And even if chemical weapons are occasionally used, it’s hard to argue that the world would be a better place if arms companies could sell chemical weapon. Or if evil despots could launch chemical attacks on their populations without fear of censure. Or a distant date in a court in the Hague. And that’s precisely how we are going to prevent a future full of killer robots. We agree that it is morally unacceptable to let machines make life or death decisions. We insist there is always a human in the loop. Just like we decided it was morally unacceptable to use chemical weapons. The rest follows from there. Arms companies don’t manufacture autonomous weapons. There are a lot of more profitable activities that won’t get them put on some UN blacklist. As a result, its not easy to get your hands on autonomous weapons. And people hesitate before using them. It goes beyond ethics. By removing humans completely, autonomous weapons will be weapons of mass destruction. One programmer will be able to do what previously took an army of humans. They will industrialise warfare. This is why it has been called the third revolution in warfare, after the invention of gun powder and of nuclear weapons. They will also be weapons of terror. We don’t know yet how to make robots that can follow international humanitarian law. And even when we can, there are plenty of bad actors out there, terrorists and rogue states, that will remove any ethical safeguards. Autonomous weapons will also destabilise the current unsettled world order. You will no longer need to be a superpower to maintain a powerful army. A couple of 3-D printers and a modest bank balance will suffice. And when someone attacks you, it will be very difficult to know who it was. Capture a killer robot. Open it up. All it will say is “Intel Inside”. That will only encourage those with evil intent. This brings me to earlier this week when we took a small step down the road to a world where killer robots are banned. Over 50 of my colleagues, leading AI and robotics researchers from 30 countries around the world, declared a boycott of KAIST. This is the MIT of South Korea. The boycott was a response to KAIST opening an AI weapons lab in collaboration with Hanwha Systems, a company that has attracted considerable negative publicity for manufacturing cluster munitions, contrary to a UN treaty. A decade ago, Norway’s future fund put Hanwha on their ethical blacklist. The Korea Times reported that KAIST was “joining the global competition to develop autonomous arms.” And it described some of the initial projects like an unmanned submarine where it is hard to imagine any sort of meaningful human control. The president of KAIST responded swiftly to our boycott. He declared that KAIST would not develop autonomous weapons. Indeed, he went further and affirmed that meaningful human control would always be maintained. This was an overnight success. It sets a very clear precedent for the future. I hope now that KAIST will lobby the Republic of Korea to call for meaningful human control at next week’s UN meeting on the topic of killer robots. Such small steps will eventually lead to an outright ban. • Toby Walsh is Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales"

          "bodyText": "If you’re typing “have I already met my soulmate?” into Google, the chances are you’re in a similarly ambiguous emotional place to the one I found myself in six years ago. Had I messed up my sole chance at passionate romantic happiness with “the one that got away”? Would I die alone, rueing that missed opportunity? Or should I settle for a more companionable partnership and a sense of family? In reality I was, and had always been, surrounded by multiple potential soulmates. Yet it took the grand adventure of touring a comedy show and writing a book for me to get myself to a place of sufficient clarity to open my eyes and see them. A few sessions with a fantastic therapist helped too. The question that I should have been asking all along was: “have I sorted out enough of my shit to be able to receive a soulmate?” The unhelpful notion that we must seek out our other half in order to complete ourselves dates back to Greek mythology and Zeus splitting four-legged two-headed humans in two. Now, as we live much longer and technology has opened up access to so many dating options, many serial monogamists find that there is a different soulmate for each stage of life. Some people are finding that simultaneous, ethical, polyamorous relationships work for them, too. And let’s not forget, as it is so easy to do in this sex-obsessed world, that platonic pals can be soulmates too. Some people are asexual and may prefer a sort of love affair friendship scenario. When I met my aforementioned one that got away, I had just embarked on the unpredictable whirlwind of a career in comedy. I was starting to do quite well. It was all rather thrilling. However, I had been hoodwinked by my own excitement. My friend Qazi Rahman, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, thinks that “the early high you get from being in the beginnings of a relationship can drive decisions that are not optimal. And being on a high in life in general can drive us into relationships that are not optimal in the first place.” I hurtled into a relationship with someone who I presumed to be the one, without applying any sort of robust filtering or rational thought processes whatsoever. Beginning a relationship when we are in a heartbroken low doesn’t tend to work either. In the book The Chemistry Between Us, Larry Young and Brian Alexander discuss an urgent, primal drive to trigger oxytocin release and relieve stress after a separation, often leading us rapidly towards new sexual pairings or rebound relationships. However, the brain cocktail is very different to the heady one we experience after a healthy break. I was ultimately astounded to meet my amazing new partner online. I had always been an advocate of the random, organic nature of meeting in real life. I was never convinced that an algorithm could allow for the nuances of human attraction. Qazi says: “the maths is based on a principle of like attracts like … but some of the interests and qualities being measured boil down to pretty mundane things.” As it happens, my partner and I match fairly poorly on shared tastes in films and music. I’m a snob. She’s into the mainstream. But it’s in our murkier, deeper emotional workings where we have real common ground. We both lost a parent during our 20s, a lonely experience we couldn’t share with many peers. We don’t sit around and talk about it. In fact, our relationship is largely filled with laughter and playfulness. But the reassuring certainty that my partner empathises with such a key traumatic lifetime event makes her feel somehow like she is right for me. A year in, we moved in together and haven’t looked back. Still, romantic life has its ups and downs. Even a fairytale soulmate can temporarily seem like a pain in the arse when they have just eaten the last biscuit. Richard Linklater’s Before Midnight is one of the few films to showcase the petty domestic squabbles, squashed dreams and compromises that follow on from even the most star-crossed beginnings. The final part of his naturalistic trilogy starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy closes with the couple, nine years into their relationship, at an outdoor restaurant in Greece. She muses on how their romantic fantasies will never be matched by the imperfection of reality. As Alain de Botton says: “We seem to know far too much about how love starts and recklessly little about how it might continue.” Surely, then, the act of acquiring a soulmate lies in the act of positively choosing “this one”, for better and, occasionally, for worse. • Rosie Wilby is a comedian, author of Is Monogamy Dead? and host of The Breakup Monologues podcast"

          "bodyText": "After a debate in the European parliament, I usually upload my intervention to YouTube, as well as to my own website. It creates transparency and an online archive of my work as an MEP. About a year and a half ago, I was told a video I’d uploaded had been taken down. This was puzzling. There can hardly be a clearer example of political speech than speaking out in parliament. Could the word “torture”, contained in the title of that particular debate (we were discussing how trade rules could be updated to end global trade in torture and death penalty equipment), have caused it to be flagged by an algorithm? I tweeted about the danger of having content taken down automatically. Promptly, Google called me. I’m not sure this is the treatment an average internet user gets. In fact, who do you call when you have a problem with a tech platform? A few hours later my video was back online, and Google went on to apologise on Twitter. The company claimed that my video had been flagged as spam. This seems quite convenient, because many users will be happy that there is filtering for spam. Still, I had no way of checking. Since I had never posted spam before, and with my account being probably boring and predictable if anything, I wasn’t convinced. Having received no reply about whether a person or an algorithm had taken the video down, or why, I was left with many unanswered questions. This small episode said a lot about the challenges of assessing how algorithmic choices can affect online content. We’ve seen how, in the wake of discussions about “fake news”, Facebook, Google and other tech platforms often resort to promises that they’ll tweak their algorithms. Now the Cambridge Analytica revelations have raised yet more acute concerns. Whenever the nefarious consequences of their profit models are exposed, tech companies essentially reply, “don’t regulate us, we’ll improve our behaviour”. But self-regulation is simply not working well enough, especially when we have no way of knowing whether tweaking algorithms makes matters better or worse. Opaque algorithms in effect challenge the checks and balances essential for liberal democracies and market economies to function. As the EU builds a digital single market, it needs to ensure that market is anchored in democratic principles. Yet the software codes that determine which link shows up first, second, third and onwards, remain protected by intellectual property rights as “trade secrets”. They’re treated like the Coca-Cola recipe. Companies argue that if algorithms were made public, they’d lose their competitive edge. It’s time we looked into how the curating of information, as it’s presented to users, can affect the rule of law online across Europe. Think about how, whenever fair economic or industrial competition is at stake, anti-trust authorities can demand that companies provide sensitive information. That information is then investigated – it isn’t released to the public. Why not apply the same logic to online activity? We know much is at stake. Think about how algorithms can add to discrimination rather than combat it: is it really as easy for a black person to rent or post a room on Airbnb as it is for a white person? How do we prevent bogus conspiracy theories going viral? Is political content, whatever its leanings, treated equally on Facebook? Are users informed about who pays for political ads? Coca-Cola’s recipe may be a secret, but it can be tested for compliance with health requirements. And if hundreds of millions of people suddenly drank nothing but soft drinks, surely public authorities would start raising concerns and work out policies to address them. None of this means we need new EU regulations or EU regulations to oversee technology platforms. The notion that laws should apply online as they do offline generally holds. But we do have to make sure there is accountability beyond mere promises of better behaviour. For oversight to be possible, regulators need to be able to assess the workings of algorithms. This can be done in a confidential manner, by empowering telecommunications and competition regulators. Those software codes wouldn’t need to be published, but their workings could be scrutinised. The impact of algorithms could be tested through a form of sampling to assess their intentions, and whether they promote some kinds of content while downplaying others. There was a time when social media was heralded as the “online public square”. But we now know that most social media companies operate like a marketplace, literally. Whoever pays the most will get more reach. The advertisement-selling mechanisms that boost profits were not built to foster democracy, and it was naive to think they were. Facebook’s work with Cambridge Analytica has served as another wake-up call. Platforms try to reassure us. “We are on to this,” they say. But blind trust is no longer sustainable. We need to know the extent to which profit-driven social media platforms truly respect the principles that protect fair competition, privacy rights, access to information and freedom of expression. What the Cambridge Analytica scandal has taught us is that there is still much we don’t know. For a long time, European efforts to introduce regulation of the digital economy were ridiculed, especially in Silicon Valley – and often in Washington too. That taboo now seems to be broken. And the EU has not shied away from setting norms in the digital economy, from defending net-neutrality to strengthening data protection. Of course, we need to make sure that any attempt to rein in the anti-democratic fallout of tech companies’ actions does nothing to stifle free speech or innovation. But by now we’re well aware that online platforms aren’t necessarily good for democracy. They weren’t designed to be. The best we can do now in Europe is create mechanisms for oversight and accountability. We cannot simply trust – we need to verify. • Marietje Schaake is a Dutch MEP and a member of the Democrats 66 political party"

It looks like someone shaved a golden retriever, then glued half of the hair on to Boss Nass, king of the Gungans. But if you think it’s easy to come up with something new, give it a try. And how about that weird, infantile yet camp phrasing he uses on Twitter? Do you see what an achievement it is to invent your own syntax? Very hard! Trump’s face, huge tie, baggy suit and narcissistic manner all make him – apologies for this – iconic. Easily recognisable when reduced to a few essential elements, he represents our moment in history. He crops up a lot in the excellent exhibition Hope to Nope: Graphics and Politics 2008-18 at the Design Museum in London, which demonstrates that good design is an elusive, amoral quantity. Shepard Fairey’s Obama poster struck a chord around the world, becoming a totem for change. When a different demographic saw the same possibility in a red trucker’s cap, we didn’t like it so much. The Make America Great Again slogan is written in Times New Roman, the world’s default font, and was seen as conveying an unaffected, everyman appeal. Genius, or lazy luck? As the exhibition also shows, the most potent, DIY form of graphic design is the meme, knocked up in seconds, around the world in minutes. I’m a sucker for a political meme. I admire their verbal dexterity and subversive visual content. I laugh out loud at Obama-Biden bromance cartoons and Free Melania gifs. I miss the less-problematic days when Jeremy Corbyn eating a Pringle did big numbers. I loved the handmade Women’s March placards from around the world, shared on Instagram: “We shall overcomb”. “Super callous, fragile, racist, sexist, lying Potus”. The child wearing a sandwich board that reads: “I love naps, but I stay woke”? He really is the absolute boy. There are a lot of subversive images in Hope to Nope, including a pro-Trump Star Wars parody, Rogue Won, by rightwing street artist Sabo, which was plastered over Hollywood’s bus stops. This was eye-opening because I didn’t realise that a) Hollywood had bus stops, and b) there was such a thing as a rightwing street artist. But there is, and they use the same tools as leftwing ones. A quick search throws up a parallel world of my favourite meme images – Morpheus, Evil Kermit, toasting DiCaprio – all with conservative messages. There’s also a darker, more particular realm that I never see, of six-pointed stars, niqabs and Pepe the Frog content that is as toxic as it is popular. (I sacrificed my “Amazon recommends” algorithm to bring you this news, so let. it. sink. in.) Clearly, the memes on our side are essential, inspiring, unifying! The opponents’ are reductive, disingenuous, demagogic. But all bypass the need for prolonged thinking, relying instead on quick impact. They trade on what we already believe, making them perfect currency for an echo chamber. Factchecking, activism and proper debate are way more work than adding a filter to a profile photo, and I only do that once a year. But there are limits to a purely visual society, and politics by meme does not serve us. There’s a thought I’m drawn to, by pioneering computer scientist John McCarthy: “As the Chinese say, 1001 words is worth more than a picture.” Having said that, I only remember the sentence because it’s short and funny. And at 60 characters, makes for a perfect tweet. Sobering! A model citizen Hot felon news!

Jez, or Ol’ Blue Steal as I call him, is rumoured to be expecting a baby with Chloe Green, heiress to the Topshop empire. So, the Meeks really will inherit the earth. I’d say a biopic can’t be far behind, but usually when they make a film about someone’s life, they find a more attractive actor to play them. Steven Hawking? Eddie Redmayne. Ray Charles? Jamie Foxx. They’re not going to find anyone hotter than this guy, unless Brad Pitt Benjamin Buttons himself back to 1995, or Freddie Ljungberg agrees to do it in his underpants. Seriously, I can’t concentrate on writing this, with his picture up. The cheekbones, the smouldering stare. Not to mention the hot tattoos, particularly that one on his forearm– what does it say: “Crip”? As in insanely violent US gang the Crips? Or maybe he really likes crisps, and is bad at spelling? What about the teardrop under his lovely blue eye? It must mean he’s sensitive. What a total dreamboat. Where next for Magwitch? I wonder if he has a Topshop collaboration in the pipeline, other than the one that’s currently foetal. I hear stripes are coming back. They should do a range of clothes to accompany babies through that difficult first year, from newborn to toddler. Meeks x Weeks, they could call it. They would make an absolute killing. The trick is to get the jump on your competitors – GBH&amp;M, Abercrombie &amp; Snitch, et al. Seasons change, and fashion is an unpredictable, unforgiving environment you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy. I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants out. Or back in. Streetfighting plan So, Streetfighter II is going to be turned into a TV series. Hardly a bolt from the blue, as they turned it into a TV series at least once before. But big news for actors of colour, considering most TV shows are still less diverse than an arcade game released in 1991. Zangief, Chun-Li, Eddie Honda, Vega – all beefy roles. Not that they have a shot. Producers may go with Ben Kingsley as Dhalsim. Apart from that it will probably be Tom Hardy playing M Bison, and every other character. With Boris Johnson as Blanka. Hard to catch a break in this town."
