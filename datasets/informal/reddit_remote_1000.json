    "selftext": "I've had issues with CarPlay/Toyota App on my 6th Gen since day 1 and now that I've talked to Toyota thought I'd report here for awareness and to see if others have found a solution.\n\nThere are multiple issues when remote starting with the Toyota app on an iPhone.  \n\n1. Custom climate settings do not work\n2. 45% of the time, the radio screen stays black until you either restart the vehicle of hold the power button down to reset the display.  Backup camera still works, radio still works, and the screen is backlit but stuck in a black mode\n3. 45% of the time, the screen works but shows an error \"Connection Interrupted: Wi-Fi connection with device interrupted. Manage connections in device settings.\".  When this occurs, both the vehicle settings and the phone show that bluetooth is connected but CarPlay is not active.  Same fix as above, restart vehicle or force restart display.\n4. The remaining 10% of the time the screen/carplay works fine.\n\nAfter calling Toyota they told me to take it in for service as it sounded like a computer issue.  The dealer could not find a problem and said when they called Toyota they acknowledged that others are having this issue and it is a \"problem with the app and Apple\".  Supposedly they hope to find a fix but nothing concrete at this point which is a frustrating answer.  Their only suggestion was to try removing the phone from the settings and add it back (aka \"Have you tried turning it off and back on again\") or \"fiddle with the wifi settings\" but they couldn't tell me what that even meant. \n\nThis is my first Toyota so not sure how often an update comes out but the dealer said they typically release one only about 2x/year.  They also couldn't tell me when the next one is expected so really hoping I don't have to deal with this for 6 months.\n\nIf you had the issue and resolved it, would love to hear what you did.  If you have the issue and have just been dealing with it, please report it to Toyota so they have some pressure to work on a fix."

I’m a product manager at a Startup with a micro manager CEO, so my job is very high visibility and high stress. I’m looking to reduce stress and workload now that I have a family.\n\nMany years ago I received advice from a colleague regarding coming back from maternity leave. She said, “never switch jobs/companies when you are coming back. The transition will be hard enough without having to prove yourself to a new team and learn new processes/stakeholders/etc.”\n\nPart of me thinks finding a role at a very large, established company might be lower stress. Particularly one that is entrenched and slower moving. I am used to a very fast paced environment so I recognize this shift could be frustrating especially as I am a high achiever, but a slower pace might allow me to focus on my new family and reduce my workload and expectations. \n\nWhat do you think: keep the same job, or find a new one? Will a bigger older company be less stressful? Or should I stay in my current role and just reduce my expectations/implement boundaries?\n\nAlso, any tips on breastmilk pumping while back at work? I work a hybrid schedule so I need to find something that works on the days that I am both remote and in office. Did you ever pump off camera while on zoom calls? (On some days I have 5 to 7 hours of meetings)"

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nThrowaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI started my business at the end of 2022. It’s a super niche SaaS involving VoIP, entirely online, and 100% remote. What started as a random side idea has now somehow become a full-blown company. (Forgive me I use ChatGPT to help me spellcheck and write this).\n\nTo give some context:\n\n* 2022: \\~100 subscribers (website started kinda as just a test of my skills and then just snowballed)\n* 2023: 458\n* 2024: 1,000\n* 2025: Just shy of 2,000\n\nTurnover has followed that growth, **£420k last year**, and on track for around **£660k this year**. Supplier costs sit around **£265k/year**, and advertising is about **£2.5k/month**. I pay myself roughly **£85k/year** (split between salary and dividends), my only employee gets **£2.5k/month**, and my partner the same. My **corporation tax bill this year alone is £31k**. This year I even bought out a competitor (they only had 50 customers) but I was super thrilled even if they were smaller. That and getting my first ever new car gave me a temporary feeling of \"I've made it\". But it's worn off (I'm late thirties).\n\nI’ve invested around **£90k** into a team of developers to build a new web app that automates about 90% of what me and my employee currently do. It’s now fully paid off and almost ready to launch, it looks fantastic and should make the business largely self-sustaining once live. But when I first started working with the developers it didn't feel 'real' now it's nearly launched my anxiety has skyrocketed. I don't know why.\n\nBut honestly, I’m struggling. The anxiety has got so bad that I’ve been having physical chest pain for weeks. I’ve worn a heart monitor for a week (Dr got me to do it), and I’m due back in hospital next week for more heart tests. Deep down, I’m convinced it’s just the stress of it all.\n\nThe strange part is that I only *really* work about **10 days a month** (not counting the late evenings between 8pm and midnight where I tidy things up). It’s all run from home, the income’s solid, and there’s no daily chaos, yet I feel either completely at peace, or completely tense, worried something will go wrong, or that I’ve somehow just got lucky and it’ll all vanish. Like I don't deserve it. And I'm so terrified of ever having to work in an office again.\n\nI never really saw myself as a business owner or entrepreneur. My sister runs her own business too (different niche) and said she went through the same thing. We both grew up poor in the UK, so to suddenly be making good money feels… unnatural, almost like I don’t deserve it.\n\nI think part of my anxiety comes from not knowing what’s next. I’ve built something real, profitable, and simple, but I’m so mentally drained I can’t imagine doing this forever.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in a similar place, how do you deal with the constant anxiety and imposter syndrome? How do you find peace when everything looks fine on paper, but inside you’re a mess? I feel bi-polar (apologies to anyone who's actually bi-polar) but my mood is either absolute bliss, or I want to destroy the world.\n\nI’m genuinely proud of what I’ve built, but I’m exhausted. Any advice or shared experiences would really help."

A lot of death and chaos before it stops when a higher pitched voice tells the person to stop.\n\n\\-\n\nThe place is in ruins. Those who haven't fled are either dead, or dying in the rubble. Two figures stand. One, Perfect Giznel. A human in his 'hands', wearing a scientist's coat. His face and red hair marred with grim and blood. Gasping for breath as the monster chokes the life out of him.\n\nThe other, a Venlil, 10, maybe 11 years old. Gray woolly fur. Fur that seems to shimmer if just for a moment. One leg, and tail made of glowing pink metal. Her eyes hard yet scared and crying. Two lay behind her. An adult with the same fur as her's, and a dark skinned human. Both battered injured and near death. The latter tries to push himself up. \"Stynek... Run...\"\n\nPerfect Giznel snaps the red haired human's neck and drops them. \"I'm sorry\" said in faux politeness. \"Did you know him? Do a little Science Nerd things together?\"\n\nA song begins to play as Stynek's gaze hardens but the crying continues. [Day of Fate (Metal Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD43uUUf2AI)\n\nHer fur goes from gray to gold and stands on end. The prosthetic leg and tail glow pink, the former bulking up to match her other leg. The latter gaining a gleaming energy blade just as pink. But with flames. Matching her pink flaming horns.\n\n---\n\nAnother click, a pause and a sqeee.\nStynek: I look sooo Splehing COOOL!!! \n\nA teenage Stynek screams.\n\nNoah lightly glares at her. \"Language young lady.\""

(Not as high as I was targeting, but it was remote so I was willing to sacrifice.) I accepted and started. Shortly after, discovered in my online account that the pay band for my position is 60-100, mid point of 80, which is what I was originally targeting with my experience and background. I was annoyed for a minute but decided to let it go. I believe this puts me at about 18% of the pay band. \n\nExcelled in that position, and was sought out by my supervisor to ask if I’d be interested in a promotion, same role but level 3 as it’s a more complicated workload and more fast paced and stressful. (It’s basically who my current position escalates the high dollar items to.) I said I would be interested, yet it’s not just a shoe in promotion.

(Not as high as I was targeting, but it was remote so I was willing to sacrifice.) I accepted and started. Shortly after, discovered in my online account that the pay band for my position is 60-100, mid point of 80, which is what I was originally targeting with my experience and background. I was annoyed for a minute but decided to let it go. I believe this puts me at about 18% of the pay band. \n\nExcelled in that position, and was sought out by my supervisor to ask if I’d be interested in a promotion, same role but level 3 as it’s a more complicated workload and more fast paced and stressful. (It’s basically who my current position escalates the high dollar items to.) I said I would be interested, yet it’s not just a shoe in promotion. I have to apply, interview, accept offer. \n\nSo eventually it’s posted and I ask what the pay band is, it’s 73-130. I would obviously LOVE to be at the midpoint of around 100k, but I feel that is probably not a reasonable number to target given my current salary/too big of a bump.

    "selftext": "Exploring the Popularity of Barndominium Homes for Sale: What Makes Them Unique?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBarndominium homes have surged in popularity in recent years, attracting a diverse range of buyers looking for something unique. These hybrid structures combine the rustic charm of a barn with the comforts of a residential home. Let’s explore the traits that set barndominiums apart and why they captivate the hearts and minds of many aspiring homeowners.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the growing appeal of barndominium homes for sale is their versatility. Here are some unique aspects you can expect:\n\n- **Customizable Space:** Barndominiums offer wide-open spaces that can be tailored to suit your lifestyle. Whether you're looking for an open floor plan, extra bedrooms, or a workshop, the possibilities are nearly endless.\n- **Cost-Effective Construction:** Compared to traditional homes, building or purchasing a barndominium can be more affordable. The materials used are often less expensive, and the simpler construction methods can save on labor costs.\n- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are designed with energy efficiency in mind. Modern insulation techniques and energy-efficient systems can lead to lower utility bills, making them an attractive choice for eco-conscious buyers.\n- **Rural Charm:** Situated on large plots of land, barndominiums often provide breathtaking views and a sense of peace that many urban homes can't offer. Living in a barndominium connects you to nature, whether you're surrounded by trees, fields, or rolling hills.\n\nAdditionally, barndominiums blend rustic aesthetics with modern amenities, creating a unique living environment. The metal exteriors and classic barn features provide a nostalgic feeling that many people find comforting. Inside, homeowners often utilize large open spaces for dining, entertainment, and relaxation, making for an inviting atmosphere that’s perfect for gatherings and family activities.\n\nAnother factor contributing to their popularity is the growing trend of remote work. Many individuals are seeking spaces that allow for productivity in a peaceful setting. A barndominium can easily accommodate a home office in a secluded area, enabling you to focus without the distractions of a traditional home environment.\n\nWhen it comes to finding the right barndominium home for sale, potential buyers appreciate having plenty of options to choose from. Listings can vary widely in size, layout, and price. Here’s what you might encounter:\n\n- **Size:** Barndominiums can range from cozy structures with about 1,000 square feet to expansive designs exceeding 3,000 square feet.\n- **Prices:** Depending on location, amenities, and size, prices for barndominium homes typically span from $150,000 to over $500,000.\n- **Features:** Many barndominiums come with high ceilings, large windows, and open-concept designs that are both functional and stylish.\n\nThe key to successfully navigating the market is understanding your needs and budget. With many listings available, it is important to look for features that enhance your lifestyle. For instance, if you enjoy outdoor activities, consider a property with ample land for hobbies like gardening, horseback riding, or even just enjoying nature. If you prefer entertaining, look for a layout that facilitates hosting gatherings with friends and family.\n\nFinding a barndominium home for sale can also be a different experience compared to traditional home buying. The process often involves working with specialized real estate agents who have a deep understanding of alternative housing. They can assist you in matching your specific requirements with available listings and prices in your desired area.\n\nUltimately, the fascination with barndominium homes reflects a desire for simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility in living. This unique housing option not only provides a functional living space but also offers a lifestyle choice that resonates with individuals seeking tranquility and harmony with nature. As their popularity continues to rise, barndominiums are becoming a remarkable solution for those looking to create their dream home in a stunning, rural setting.\n\nUnderstanding Barndominium Listings and Price Trends Across Different Regions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBarndominiums are rapidly gaining popularity across various regions as unique and affordable living options. Understanding the listings and price trends of barndominium homes can help you in making informed decisions if you’re looking to purchase one. Knowing how prices differ between regions and what to look for in listings can make the process exciting and practical.\n\nThe barndominium trend originated in rural areas but is not limited to the countryside. Cities are now embracing these structures, leading to a diverse range of listings. Before diving into the specifics of price trends across regions, it's essential to highlight what makes barndominiums appealing to buyers.\n\nFirst, barndominiums offer a blend of rustic charm and modern amenities. These homes can be customized to fit personal preferences, from expansive open layouts to stylish interiors. In addition, their sturdy metal frames often require less maintenance than traditional homes. Because of these features, many buyers are willing to invest in this unique housing option.\n\nWhen looking for barndominiums for sale, you’ll find various listings to choose from. Here are some factors to consider while reviewing these listings:\n\n- **Location:** The location dramatically affects the price. Barndominiums in rural areas generally cost less than those found in urban settings.\n- **Size and Layout:** Barndominiums vary widely in size. A larger space with more rooms will typically have a higher price point.\n- **Age and Condition:** Newly built barndominiums may come at a premium compared to older properties in need of renovations.\n- **Customization:** Homes with custom features, such as unique finishes or eco-friendly systems, often come with a higher price tag.\n\nNext, let’s explore how prices vary across different regions. This understanding will help you determine what you can expect in your desired area.\n\nIn the Midwest, barndominiums are making waves primarily due to the availability of land. Prices here can range from $100,000 to $300,000 depending on the size and location. States like Missouri and Iowa showcase a healthy inventory of barndominium listings with exciting price options. The average cost per square foot typically falls between $150 to $200, making it an attractive choice for buyers.\n\nMoving south, Texas stands out as a hotbed for barndominium homes. With more land and friendly regulations, Texas offers a variety of listings ranging from cozy 1,000-square-foot models to sprawling multi-bedroom homes. You can find prices here from $200,000 to over $600,000 based on key factors like location and amenities. The Dallas and Austin metropolitan areas show some of the most competitive pricing, with average costs anywhere from $100 to $250 per square foot.\n\nThe West Coast, particularly in states like California and Oregon, is witnessing increased interest in barndominiums as well. However, the price points can be heightening compared to other regions. In California, for instance, you may see barndominium listings starting around $400,000 and averaging between $200 to $350 per square foot. Though they offer unique living styles, buyers often face the challenge of limited availability and higher real estate prices overall.\n\nMeanwhile, states in the Northeast region also are catching on to the barndominium trend, albeit with varying levels of availability. Homes in rural New York or Pennsylvania might offer more competitive pricing, generally falling within the $250,000 to $400,000 range. Listings in these areas closely reflect the local demand for unique housing options, showcasing prices generally closer to $150 to $250 per square foot.\n\nWhile the trends may vary, one commonality across all regions is the increasing demand for barndominiums. As more people discover the benefits of this style of living, it's likely that listings will continue to grow in number and diversity.\n\nWhen searching for barndominiums for sale, staying informed about these factors will be crucial. Whether you are in a bustling city or a quiet stretch of countryside, recognizing how prices trend and what listings are available will guide you in finding your dream barndominium. Happy house hunting!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs the market for barndominium homes continues to grow, it becomes clear why so many people are drawn to this unique housing option. The fusion of rustic charm and modern living is unmatched. If you're contemplating a barndominium as your next home, you'll find it not only offers a comfortable lifestyle but also a sense of individuality that traditional homes often lack.\n\nDelving into barndominium listings reveals a diverse array of designs and price points, catering to various budgets and preferences. By examining price trends across different regions, prospective buyers can make informed decisions. Whether you’re looking for a cozy getaway in the countryside or a spacious family home, the barndominium market is teeming with possibilities.\n\nMoreover, the rising popularity of these homes underscores their appeal, especially among those seeking an open floor plan, energy efficiency, and a connection to nature. With many listings available, it’s easier than ever to find a barndominium that fits both your lifestyle and budget.\n\nNavigating this exciting landscape will require some research, but the investment can lead to a unique living experience that combines comfort, creativity, and community. Keep an eye on listings to find your dream barndominium and become part of this thriving movement. The perfect home awaits you!"

I'm not saying it's necessarily bad but if it's done tastefully I can still enjoy it. I'm a sucker for emotional depth, chemistry, yearning and the BANTER. I'll always love books where romance is done subtly as a subplot. \nAll the books I come across subreddits and as recommendations seem very heavy in spice and sexualisation. Books marketed as enemies to lovers but the moment the MCs gaze falls onto each other it's an internal monologue of how they can't can't keep their hands to themselves and how hot they look.\n\nAnother thing I'm looking for in Romantasy is beautiful prose and plot where I'm not in it just for the romance but for the actual plot. I need witty characters who can be humourous and the banter is a need. I don't want overtly sexualised descriptions of how buff the MMC looks or how huge the FMC's Breasts are.\n\nThe books I've enjoyed are \n\nThe Folk of the Air Trilogy \n\nSix of crows duology (Honestly, anything by Leigh bardugo although I didn't enjoy \"The Familiar\" much)\n\nThe Irresistible Urge to fall in love with your Enemy (LOVED THE BANTER)\n\nDraco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love ( fanfiction but by the same author who wrote the above book, then again the BANTER)\n\nplease recommend me some books I'm in dire need and I've been searching endlessly for anything remotely close "

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 19-year-old from Pavia, Italy, with a high school diploma in industrial informatics (graduated with a perfect 100/100 score on the maturity exam). I also have a C1 level in English and a bunch of Cisco certifications already under my belt, including:\n\n- Operating Systems Basics\n- Computer Hardware Basics\n- Engaging Stakeholders for Success\n- Introduction to Greenhouse Gas Accounting for IT\n- Introduction to Modern AI\n- Network Defense\n- Ethical Hacker\n- Endpoint Security\n- Introduzione alla Cybersecurity\n- IT Essentials\n- CCNA: Introduction to Networks\n- Partner: NDG Linux Unhatched\n- Partner: CLA - Programming in C\n\nI'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's program in Industrial Management Engineering (triennale), but I'm not passionate about it—it's more of a \"safe\" choice. Instead, I'm seriously considering dropping out to focus on a self-study plan in cybersecurity, which I think aligns better with my interests and background. The plan is about 9-12 months long and includes:\n\n- Phase 0: Set up LinkedIn, GitHub, TryHackMe; install tools like VirtualBox, Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer (2 days).\n- Phase 1: CompTIA A+ (2 months) – hardware, OS basics, troubleshooting via Professor Messer/Udemy.\n- Phase 2: CompTIA Network+ (1 month) – networking, TCP/IP, labs in Packet Tracer.\n- Phase 3: CompTIA Security+ (2 months) – security fundamentals, TryHackMe PreSecurity path.\n- Phase 4: Cisco CyberOps Associate (1-2 months) – log analysis, SIEM, SOC sims on TryHackMe/NetAcad.\n- Phase 5: Build portfolio – complete 8-12 TryHackMe rooms, document on GitHub, update LinkedIn.\n- Phase 6: AWS Cloud Practitioner + Solutions Architect (3-4 months) – cloud basics, AWS Free Tier/Udemy.\n- Phase 7: Job hunt – English CV, mock interviews, 30-50 apps/month on LinkedIn/Glassdoor/Relocate.me.\n\nMy goal is entry-level cybersecurity roles like Junior SOC Analyst, Security Analyst, or Cloud Security Specialist. I live in Pavia but can easily commute to Milan (30-40 min train ride), where there's a bigger tech scene. Based on research (Glassdoor, etc.), I'm aiming for 30-35k € gross annual salary to start (which seems realistic for Milan with these certs and portfolio?).\n\nQuestions for the community:\n1. Is this plan solid? What gaps should I fill (e.g., more Linux, scripting, or specific tools)?\n2. What's the realistic success rate for landing an entry-level cyber job in Italy without a degree but with these certs/portfolio? 80-90% if I grind hard?\n3. Worth dropping uni for this? Or should I try to balance both (part-time uni + certs)? Pros/cons from those who've done similar?\n4. Any Italy-specific tips? Job sites, companies in Milan (e.g., IBM, Accenture), networking events, or remote opportunities abroad with my English level?\n5. Salary expectations: Can I hit 35k € entry-level in Milan, or is that optimistic without experience?\n\nAppreciate any advice, success stories, or warnings—trying to make a smart decision here. Thanks!"

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share a strategy that most people don't know exists. It can be a quick way to make some extra cash if you're struggling. It's called **bonus arbitrage**.\n\nEssentially, some companies spend so much on customer acquisition that they sometimes overpay or make mistakes, and you can profit from it. You're literally just exploiting that inefficiency for profit.\n\n**Here's a perfect example that takes 5 minutes (or even less):**\n\nSoFi (the fintech company) pays platforms $75 to bring them someone who creates an account and makes a deposit, and they **only** require a $25 deposit to qualify.\n\nSo you deposit $25, they pay you $75. That's it. Takes about 3-4 minutes total.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  Sign up: [**Gemsloot**](https://gemsloot.com/?aff=shg) *(this is the platform we use for arbitrage)*\n2.  Search \"SoFi Invest\" and click \"start offer\"\n3.  Create account, deposit $25\n4.  Get $75 payout within \\~24 hours\n\n**Why does this work?** Companies would rather overpay to guarantee a conversion than waste millions on ads that might not work. They're just throwing money at customer acquisition, and sometimes the math doesn't add up in their favor. You can literally exploit this if you can find these rare opportunities.\n\nThis isn't a one-off thing either. There's usually like 5-10 live offers like this at any given time, you just need to know where to find them.\n\n➡️ **If you're looking for more arbitrage opportunities, there's a full list here:** [**bonusarb.com**](http://bonusarb.com)\n\nLet me know if you have questions!"

    "selftext": "[](https://www.totemlabs.com/)\n\nHowdy, Totem Tribe! 🫶\n\nWelcome to everyone joining our new community subreddit! With so many folks curious about how Totem has been working out at real events, I wanted to share a collection of stories and reviews we’ve received over the past few months.\n\nIf you’re on the fence about getting one or just want to swap stories, you’re in the right place. Our team hangs out here pretty often, so don’t hesitate to ask questions or say hi. Can’t wait to see some of you out at a meetup soon! 💫\n\nYou can also see the pics of all of these lovely humans with their Totems, as well as their star ratings, on the full [Reviews Page](https://www.totemlabs.com/reviews)!\n\n\n\n**May 31st, 2025 - Chris from Washington, Order #1284**\n\nAt my first big festival, a friend disappeared mere moments in the door! Chronic sidequesting behaviour notwithstanding, it was an anxious set or two before we randomly managed to catch up again. Having the Totems would've alleviated the group's worry from jump street... having them now puts us at ease. Used it at a few mid-sized shows like Thunderdome, Voyd dome just for peace of mind finding our merry crowd roving band.... Even stashed one in a bag with the seated group so some of the less directionally gifted could find their way back through the sea of lasers. Having a large festie family, with varying tastes and a lust for stage running, there's no need to worry about finding each other, or the landmark SpongeBob totem wandering away just when cell service goes out and that's the only way they know to find us. A bit of feedback: Maybe a little desktop utility UX for managing updates and making understanding firmware status easier to understand could help some folks out. I'm fairly tech savvy and I'd even appreciate a little user feedback, clarity after my first few updates!\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxm5oSR-KJA&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=12)\n\n\n\n**Apr 14th, 2025 - Todd from Michigan, Order #8507**\n\nI haven't had a chance to use it at a concert yet, but I have 4 and have used them on an acre of land. Seems very accurate! I think it'll not only help locate my group, but may even start conversation with others when they see it leading to a more enjoyable concert experience. Some constructive feedback: make sure folks understand these only work outside - I'm also finding they take a heck of a long time to find a satellite signal. That confuses me because I'm in a rural area with a large clear view of the sky.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Z3QJPvCmw&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=14)\n\n\n\n**Apr 2nd, 2025 - Davon from Texas, Order #1920**\n\nOne of my most convenient daily uses of Totem is to find my wife's direction when she is out walking the dog. The Totem Compass ultimately will allow for more freedom and side quests while still feeling connected w my player 2 across a park. Would love to see an app version come out too!\n\n\n\n**Mar 31st, 2025 - Sassal from New South Wales, Order #6416**\n\nThe Totem Compass was absolutely amazing and I enjoyed my day and nights as I didn't have to worry about anyone. I liked it so much I found myself becoming a salesperson to my friends in the morning. I had footage of my sales pitch and shared online. The Totem Compass provides safety, stress and worry free mind all day and night. Just living more in the moment 🥰\n\n\n\n**Mar 31st, 2025 - Austen from Colorado, Order #2327**\n\nI used it at a concert venue and it worked perfectly, allowing me to find my group post snack and merch lines. Usually we have meetup points but we were all at different areas when I needed to find one for my phone. I think moving forward totem compass will allow me to find my group of friends or allow me to roam, then re-find my group with extreme ease! Feedback: better battery life or more colors for straps, charging port could also be set a little different to allow more consistent charging.\n\n\n\n**Mar 31st, 2025 -** [](https://www.totemlabs.com/reviews#)**Haley from Georgia, Order #5045**\n\nAll of my rave friends have one and we went to a rave in downtown Atlanta. Worked like a charm. If people could rent these at shows I think it would be a game changer. I worked Ground Control for Insomniac and the largest issue people had were finding their friends when they most needed them. It was scary for a lot of people when they were separated with no form of communication. People couldn’t find their DD after going on side quests or friends would go on side quests and lose their group entirely. It was always a mess. Not to mention for me, going to the bathroom and trying to comb through a crowd at the stage and never being able to find my group. It was a mess. Totem will dissolve those issues entirely. Lowkey, I know there was a lot asked of totem, but remembering how to operate the thing can be daunting. I think buttons on the back would help, but it’s really great otherwise.\n\n\n\n**Mar 31st, 2025 - Edgar from California, Order #2085**\n\nMy experience was great! As soon as I got mine I made sure I linked all my friends and my totem together and went outside to try them out at a local park see if we can find each other. I now never have to worry or struggle on having to locate my friends in events or worry that I can’t find them. Some feedback: keep the color chosen on the totems to display on the compass to remember who’s totem is who versus the standard colors that are used in the order they were synced with.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEJVYicFDQA&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=13)\n\n\n\n**Mar 20th, 2025 -** [](https://www.totemlabs.com/reviews#)**Matt from Colorado**\n\nOrder #3703\n\nI've used it in the mountains while on the ski slopes. It worked great! I didn't like how the update process worked. I would love to see in the future an app that allows you to connect to your devices to update them rather than doing things with the wifi or change the name of my phone. Thankfully, I have worked in IT for over 10 years so I felt confident when doing the upgrade. I worry others may not be as confident or understand of how the update process works.\n\n\n\n**Mar 20th, 2025 - Michael from Georgia**\n\nOrder #6372\n\nI used my Totems on St Patrick's Day. I am from Savannah Georgia, which we are notorious for having the second biggest parade in the world so it was very useful. Will definitely be able to keep track of my friends and my friends will definitely be able to keep track of me a lot better, if not effortlessly! If it is possible, being able to choose the color of your totem would be a cool improvement.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG-Bok_MGRk&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=4)\n\n\n\n**Mar 16th, 2025 - Hannah from Georgia**\n\nOrder #5847\n\nI am currently at Reggae Rise up in Florida. My dad, daughter and I have been using them the entire time. WHAT A GAME CHANGER! My dad has used it to find us multiple times after we have been separated. Saves us from trying to call each other in the fun chaos of dense crowds and loud music at the festival. While I have signal I’m going to re-look up how to recalibrate them (I think it was spinning around in circles while in compass mode) because on day 3 they have gotten a little “off” from where we actually are. But I have gotten sooo many questions from so many people about them. Hopefully it has brought you more sales, we love these so much! The ease of finding each other and those moments of needing SOS is so incredible. They look amazing and are versatile as to how you wear them. It gives me such peace of mind! Some feedback: A downloadable version of the quick easy to use guide. For those moments (like what we had) needing to look back at what to do. But the internet won’t load because so many people on the cell network. Also if this already exists and I missed it. My bad 😅\n\n\n\n**Mar 10th, 2025 - Adrian from Texas**\n\nOrder #1044\n\nMy friends and I first played around with them while hiking and did a little hide and seek just to make sure they were all connected properly. Later that evening we took them to Countdown in San Bernardino. They worked pretty well, and actually helped us when one of our friends had a blood glucose scare. Three of us went to go get water and the rest waited by the food stands. While we were waiting for water station, one of my friends got really lightheaded and needed to sit down. It turns out she had rushed to meet us at the venue, and in the process didn't get to eat before arriving. Her blood sugar tanked and our friends had her candy/snacks. We used the SOS feature and after a few minutes of wondering why we were taking so long, my other friends realized that the SOS beacon was flashing on their totems. They eventually made their way to us and helped us get her situated and feeling better again. I truly believe that without the totems, there's no way they would've found us in the crowd, and we wouldn't have gotten my friend the help she needed as soon as she did. Overall it was a great experience! The batteries died on us by the end of the night, and the metal roofs made them pretty unusable, but I understand that there have been new updates since and I have yet to try them out. I'm excited to see how it goes moving forward, and to see how well they'll work in Breakaway Dallas and this upcoming EDCLV 2025! I definitely think it will allow for more independence without worry of losing friends who tend to wander at outdoor festivals and maybe even while hiking.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE86Fs4sjoQ&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=2)\n\n\n\n**Mar 7th, 2025 - Chase from Colorado, Order #2094**\n\nMy daughter and I got 3 of 5 set up. (Very excited to have them at the Colorado regional burn when we take the kids) No cell service. The night we got them she walked down the street. I drove my car in a different direction. Left the third one in a tiny library. Then I went and found her. And she got in the car and then we went and she found the one in the little library. It went flawlessly. If I get consistent using it, it will come in clutch when it's needed. Hoping it will be something that is just there, working and ready to go when and if it's needed and fade into the background when it's not. Start up and learning to use the device was pretty seamless. My 11 year old picked it up pretty quick too. I think there was some confusion around the color of the device. And which light in the gem belonged to which person/device early on. More clarity on that in the training video might be helpful. But I'm guessing it will become clear over time also. Also just want to say great work with the totem Tuesday emails. My partner is a marketing expert and I was so impressed by them. I showed them to her. They felt personable, informative, and following the technology you were building was genuinely interesting for me to read. I'm impressed. I hope you all do very well.\n\n\n\n**Mar 7th, 2025 - Link from Queens, New York, Order #3202**\n\nUsing my Totem Compasses was easier than I expected. BUT, you have to spend the 5 minutes that it takes reading the manual. Maybe there is an option to turn off the light when the Totem is in vertical mode. The blinking light was fun but it got old. I could have really used these all over Burning Man last year, tracking down my partner.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8S6bAOS6rg&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=11)\n\n\n\n**Mar 6th, 2025 - Ben from Texas, Order #2405**\n\nMy Totem Compass experience was amazing! Perfection so far, will definitely help groups stay together!\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOsswOsd8_8&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=10)\n\n\n\n**Mar 6th, 2025 - Graham from Colorado, Order #3916**\n\nFriends lost at a festival? Not anymore. Don't know how to describe the location of a stage? Just follow the light! Buddy having a bad time? SOS mode to the rescue. It's a super handy tool. I used Totem compasses to keep track of my friends at a protest recently. This technology isn't just for festivals and fun! It worked great, we did get separated at one point but found each other easily. I don't know if this is possible, but adding/improving indoor functionality would be awesome.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wYCMqzLXi8&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=5)\n\n\n\n**Mar 5th, 2025 - Mat from Norwich, UK, Order #4534**\n\nThere's always some time when you're wandering around looking for people and while randomly wandering a festival is sometimes the most fun, it's not so great when you're trying to find someone. I once spent FOUR HOURS at the \"Meeting point\" at Glastonbury with what felt like 25,000 other people looking for my friend Steve. He was there for most of the time! My Totem Compass experience was mostly great, the learning curve for the UI is a little steep but that's always the way with simple interfaces. Once I'd got a handle on what the controls did/meant it felt very natural. Overall, I feel way less panic about where the kids are, especially as they get a bit older and want more independence!\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBQGntfX-Y&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=3)\n\n\n\n**Mar 1st, 2025 - Jessica from New South Wales, Order #5136**\n\nI am an event performer and my husband is an event photographer. Sometimes we are working the same events at different areas, and it can be so difficult to find each other after our sets! Radios can only work so well (when you can hear them). Totems would have made finding each other a breeze, without the annoyance of listening to other people on our same radio channel. Using my Totems was a lot of fun! We played LED frisbee in complete darkness and were actually able to play for a while, since we could see where each person was standing because of their Totem. Considering I work at events often, this compass is going to be an absolute game changer! It will save me so much time and stress while being separated from my group. It will give me the freedom to explore on my own more, with the peace of mind I can find my crew easily! I feel the Totems can do with a longer battery life when in vibe mode. We had them on vibe mode for about 4-5 hrs and they were flashing red by the end of our session. Granted this was our first time playing with them, I now understand to use them in Eco mode more often, but vibe mode is fun 😁\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f64XNA9RVks&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=15)\n\n\n\n**Feb 19th, 2025 - Mark from Illinois, Order #2119**\n\nI've used the Totem Compass and it was amazing!! It will change live events in the future by allowing solo missions to occur and also for us to find each other wherever, whenever! In terms of feedback, I think some cooler animations would be dope.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZQcEREyk0A&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=8)\n\n\n\n**Feb 19th, 2025 - Luis from Arkansas, Order #7438**\n\nMy Totem Compass experience was joyful, and a relief to know we can locate each other. Will make live events much more enjoyable and worry free! One piece of feedback: for the tutorial video on acquiring a satellite signal, please provide more detail. As in, when to know it connects/loses connection etc. Also the lanyard could use modifications.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot2CsFeHamY&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=7)\n\n\n\n**May 18th, 2025 - Conner from New York, Order #3862**\n\nSo far, it’s been great at connecting me with my friends, although it is difficult to use in New York City. Distance isn’t amazing, but that’s what I’d expect when there’s so much metal and concrete around. Overall, it’ll make life so much easier to split up with friends and not have to worry about being perfect about meetup times and spots! I know it will be difficult to get indoor tracking working, but that would be a huge help for indoor events!\n\n\n\n**Apr 2nd, 2025 -** **Bryan from Ohio, Order #8086**\n\nI haven't gotten a chance to use it at a festival yet, my next will probably be Lost Lands. I have however messed with them some, and it's all felt incredibly smooth and easy to use. Keeping track of my friends will never be as difficult, and I'll get to spend more time actually enjoying shows with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Mar 22nd, 2025 - Mary-Alice from South Carolina, Order #1686**\n\nOur experience so far was great. Only a few minor things, like we feel the bonding is giving us issues because we can't get them into the bonding mode at the same time but I think that this may be operator error. During the day the crystal light seems so dim this could just be me, the tracking is good. There isn't much error there except if the compass is facing with the bottom of the crystal towards you seems to not read out correctly. Definitely doesn't work well in city scapes. We enjoy that it breathes when you're out of range. Other than the finicky bonding it's really easy to use and get into different modes. I think they will be great both inside and outside of festivals. There's so many applications that a device like this can be helpful. Helping people find their people is so incredibly important. Safety does matter and making it back to your people safe matters.\n\n\n\n**Mar 16th, 2025 - Kris from North Carolina, Order #8441**\n\nModerate success on the first outing. After testing and confirming all updates and connectivity when I received my 4 totems, (1 wouldn't connect when 1st delivered and was replaced), our 1st time out using them, 1 would not connect to the satellite at all and was rendered ineffective for our trial run. It rapidly died ahead of the others because it was constantly circling searching for connectivity. The other 3 worked fine, but the lack of user prep by my other tribe members made it challenging for them to operate. We will run a refresher course and try again when we gather again in 2 weeks. Our festival group is always at least 6 (3 couples) and the compass will allow us to move about more independently to different stages, locations, etc..and then join back up. Getting group consensus with 6 is challenging, plus bathroom breaks, etc... We are really expecting these compasses to change our whole festival movements.\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9yVdN30se8&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=6)\n\n\n\n**Mar 8th, 2025 - Anonymous from New Jersey, Order #7244**\n\nIt was great! the satellite acquisition can be really slow at times, but once I got it. Also it would be nice if I can install a stationary totem throughout the festival grounds in order to increase range. I also had sooo many people asking me about this so thank you. I believe the Totem Compass has incredible potential to transform live events by connecting people in ways we’ve never seen before. It offers a practical solution for helping people find each other at outdoor events, fostering a deeper sense of community and togetherness. One of its standout benefits is the peace of mind it provides—knowing you can easily locate your friends or loved ones in a crowded or remote setting is a game-changer. I’m especially excited about how this product could impact families. For parents, the Totem Compass feels like a must-have tool, particularly at transformational events like Burning Man. It’s amazing to think about how it could empower families to attend these experiences together, giving them the confidence to bring children along without the constant worry of losing track of them. This added security could open up life-changing events to a broader audience, making them more inclusive and accessible. Looking ahead, I see even more possibilities. A future feature could enhance the device’s ability to facilitate connections with new people you meet at events—imagine a function that helps you stay linked with someone you’ve just clicked with, turning fleeting encounters into lasting relationships. Overall, the Totem Compass is a brilliant product idea that could elevate live events to the next level, blending technology with human connection in a way that feels both innovative, natural, and just bad ass!\n\n\n\n**Mar 7th, 2025 - Tommy from Quebec, Order #8306**\n\nEvery year i go to the FEQ with friends, its always hard to find each other with 120k people around. Every time we go replenish water, its a journey. I used my Totem Compass at home with friends. If more people start getting it, it will make it so easy to find our people in a concert! I have no feedback for you guys!\n\n[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAyODya2wds&list=PLOegdwx9xxYhpXYiW1JfZJipsyaKaQ9ze&index=9)\n\n\n\n**Feb 18th, 2025 - Order #7106 - Marcos from California**\n\nMy experience using the Totem Compass was good! Slightly confusing set up but other than that good! I’m going to EDC this year and me ands my friend can’t wait to use them.\n\n\n\n**Feb 18th, 2025 - Samantha from Washington, Order #9740**\n\nI’ve very new to the festival scene but I’ve started going with my partner and his friends. They love to side quest and I’m the mom of the group basically so I worry when they are missing for extended lengths. Having these totems would have given me a bit more peace of mind so I can enjoy without worrying. I have only been able to play around with it around the area so far but have enjoyed seeing how it will work in a festival! When syncing my totems I had to resync a couple times to get it to process right. I believe that was more user error though. I would love to be able to choose what color my totem displays, then each person can be assigned a color that corresponds with every totem instead of the color corresponding with which sync position it was.\n\n"

    "selftext": "Five uncrewed boats remotely-piloted from 500 miles away swarmed around HMS Tyne in a demonstration of how the Royal Navy could utilise such technology on operations.\n\nA real-life scenario of escorting a warship was played out during 72 hours of training off the coast of Scotland.\n\nIn a milestone for the navy’s Disruptive Capabilities and Technology Office, seven 7.2m autonomous Rattler boats have been trialled over the past few months with their latest test pushing the boats and their controllers to their limits.\n\nWhile on board XV Patrick Blackett, sitting alongside in HMNB Portsmouth, sailors, Royal Marines and Army personnel remotely-piloted five of the boats as they sailed in Scotland 500 miles away.\n\nThe demonstration saw the vessels work with P2000 HMS Biter of the Coastal Forces Squadron, a Merlin helicopter, HMS Tyne and HMS Stirling Castle in a proof of concept exercise.\n\nWith cameras, sensors and other data being fed back to Patrick Blackett, the Rattlers were able to successfully and safely escort Tyne and Stirling Castle who were playing the role of foreign warships.\n\nThe demonstration was a culmination of months of trials for DCTO and the Fleet Experimentation Squadron (FXS) while the project of procuring the boats saw the Royal Navy adopt a radical new approach with industry.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, they took the idea of the custom-built, fully crewless vessels and delivered them – with training and first sea trials taking place shortly after.\n\nIt’s the first time the Royal Navy has procured a fleet of customised uncrewed surface vessels, with the short turnaround time for delivery showing its intent going forward.\n\nWorking alongside a consortium of SMEs, military personnel helped design, build, test and develop the vessels to ensure they would be ready to perform in the most demanding conditions – with operators leading and giving direct feedback on research and development to allow the project to move so quickly. \n\nBased on a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) and with autonomy packages and a variety of other systems and services, the boats have been built and iterated to meet Royal Navy specifications.\n\nUnlike previous drones operated by the navy they have been designed to be fully uncrewed. Each vessel can operate individually or as part of a swarm. They can be pre-programmed with mission profiles, navigational routes and can work together as a ‘wolf pack’ on operations. In time they will be able to operate without direct human control.\n\nEquipped with a suite of high quality, military spec sensors, cameras, and modular systems, the boats are adaptable for a range of tasks including surveillance, reconnaissance, and payload delivery.\n\nTheir ability to be moved quickly by air, on road and launch from portable slipways opens the door to global operations, even in challenging environments. Each vessel is operated by a two-person team: one responsible for piloting the drone, the other monitoring and operating the onboard systems and assisting to manage the live data streams. The entire setup is fully portable, run via a “plug and play” laptop configuration, allowing easy, flexible and full operation from various fixed and mobile locations.\n\nBefore heading to Scotland, the drones operated without fanfare from their base port of Portsmouth and have been zipping through the incredibly busy waters of the Solent and Portland.\n\nCommander Michael Hutchinson, Commanding Officer of both the newly formed Fleet Experimental Squadron and Experimental Vessel Patrick Blackett, has led the Royal Navy team as they have developed this technology and advanced the project to this stage.\n\nHe said: “This is a really important moment for the Royal Navy as we progress towards a Hybrid Navy of crewed and uncrewed platforms. We have been using autonomous systems for some time, but not like this.\n\n“These USVs have been built and developed at pace, in a ground-breaking way, alongside a coalition of fantastic local companies this has been the most exciting project of my career.\n\n“These platforms will be used alongside and in support of existing and future warships and as a capability in their own right. It is a technology that will continue to develop and it will fundamentally change the way we fight.”\n\nHe added: “In recent years we have seen the effect that autonomy and uncrewed systems can have at sea, on land and in the air, especially in Ukraine. In the maritime domain in particular the effect has been remarkable, with simple, cheap, one-way effectors used to defeat complex and capable Warships and deny them freedom of manoeuvre at sea.\n\n“USVs are also being used for reconnaissance, patrol, constabulary and survey tasks, so they are incredibly versatile and it is critical that the Navy develop these systems and train people with the skills to operate them to match the threat of our adversaries and ensure that we remain ready to lead, fight and win.”\n\nThis project forms part of the Royal Navy’s broader push into uncrewed and autonomous systems as part of a Hybrid Navy. XV Patrick Blackett is paving the way for autonomous warship operations while XV Excalibur is working as a testbed for future underwater warfare.\n\nBrigadier Jaimie Roylance, the Royal Navy Chief Technology Officer said: “I am incredibly proud of the team, this is an important moment in the history of the Royal Navy.\n\n“It is the first time we have been able to field a capable, mission ready, deployable uncrewed system at sea and it is the first major success for the DCTO.\n\n“The work that FXS, the Coastal Forces Squadron, Royal Marines and Army have done to develop not just the platforms, but the way we train them and the way we fight with them has been astonishing and completed in record time.\n\n“There is more work to be done, but I know the team and the wider consortium of SMEs we are working with are up to the task and I am excited about the next project.”"

    "selftext": "I'm new to teaching so forgive me if I come across not knowing anything.\n\nGiven the nature of these schools, it seems like some students are here mainly because their parents can cough up the cash, and not because they’re academically inclined.  Or because they have a sibling who happens to be quite talented, and they're just an add-on.\n\nNow, there are plenty of great students, and even more who are perfectly decent and motivated.  But there are a non-zero number who seem to just take up space.\n\nI'm talking about the kid who's been in an English-medium school for 4 years and can barely write a single sentence in English - but somehow passed their composition classes.\n\nTake my intro to programming course as an example. It’s not meant to be especially rigorous as it's an elective.  It's mostly about getting comfortable with syntax, logic, and basic computational thinking. Then there's a valley when it comes to the C and D range.  Then there's a blip at the lower end, A handful who might have been from some remote village in the mountains and never seen a computer in their life.\n\nI’m talking about students who forget their passwords every other class, don’t know how to download starter code (even though we’ve done it nearly every class), and ask questions like “how do I make a new file?” or even “how do I copy and paste?\" (even though we those are basic skills they should have).\n\nYet somehow they'll go home and like clockwork have stuff done (AI slop of course) by 6PM.  Despite never being able to complete classwork.  Since I wasn't able to prove AI usage on these exercises, I am not allowed to give any sort of penalty.\n\nAt some point you start to wonder if it's learned helplessness (they've figured out that they can simply pass because the admin will allow it), trolling, or genuine stupidity.  I anticipated some difficulty with some students, but this kind of stuff is crazy.\n\nI've been told I have to differentiate work.  So I do have to make a dumbed down assignment for those students.  Which is annoying because it means more work on my end, and somehow those students won't even do *that*."

    "selftext": "Here's Saaga. Saaga was the greatest dog i have ever had who left us suddenly yet in the best manner we could have hoped for on 30.10.2025. The end came suddenly, after a long life at a familiar caring vet. No prolonged goodbyes or years of fighting against a prolonged painful disease. We also had the chance to properly say goodbye to her.\n\nOne day she was fine and energetic, and in the night she started to feel unwell and started shaking. She woke me up several times in the night for pets and scratches that seemes to calm her down. In the morning her back legs started failing so we booked a vet as soon as possible. She was this sick once before in her life but she just had eaten some rotten crap outside and antibiotics tool care of it.\n\nMe and my wife smiled with her till the very end and i took an hour bank leave just to lie beside her and make her feel easier before the vet. Once we finally got there, we quickly got the bad news that a tumor had erupted in her liver, meaning that it's a matter of hours before she would leave us. It took only around 30 minutes to get her purebred \"sister\" to arrive and the rest of my family to her at the vet to send her off to her final adventure.\n\nI've had pets come and go but if o had to compare, the earlier ones going have been like firecrackers compared to this emotional atomic bomb. There is no hatred, no \"what if's\", no second guessing or thoughts that if we gave her a good life. Just pure and bottomless sorrow and longing.\n\nI still remember how calm she was in my arms and how my throat was filled with black spikes as her fastened heartbeat disappeared when i held her for the final time while my wife looked her in the eyes and pet her head as the light and warmth left her body.\n\nWe spent a fortune at the vet during a past few years fixing different issues and a few tumors before, had medical check ups often after these and just last week she got clean papers on her checkup. She got even ultrasound scanned a few times yet the tumor was completely invisible until the final scan yesterday to see if anything could be done.\n\nShe was with me for +10 years and she was my best and most trusted friend. No matter what mood i was in, no matter where i went she wanted to be with me and my wife. I take the garbage out? She screams when i come back. Back from the gym? Screams of happiness and jumping against my leg. In the middle of walk she just stopped and demanded i give her hugs and scratches. People said they have never seen a dog to be so attached to a person.\n\nWhile i mainly worked remotely for the past 7 years, she had a spot under my table, and every time i looked at her when she wasn't sleeping she would turn her belly for rubs. We were together with her for almost 24/7 and never even travelled to places she couldn't come so we could spend as much time with her and her sister as we could.\n\nSaaga, you were the best dog in the world and a friend unlike any other. I will miss you forever and once my heart stops beating i hope to meet you in some way in the darkness from where we both once came to be.\n\n----\n\nFirst picture is her running on a forest field that will be placed next to her urn.\n\nSecond picture is the last one of her i took where a few days before she was peaceful, happy and belly filled with meatballs. Her apetite was a bit off, which we incorrectly thought as just a tummyache so she got an accidental very special last days on earth diet.\n\nThird picture is from our last hotel trip with her. She loved the travels but as an ultra energetic dog when the batteries ran out she liked to sleep deep.\n\nLast picture is her on her usual \"work place\" next to me, which will now be forever empty. These are not the best photos i have (except for the forst one) but give a good idea who she was.\n\n----\n\nThank you for reading this far, it means a lot to me and helps me work through the fact that my new life without her has begun."

I needed a hip replacement and I was in a lot of pain. I was let go from my job despite this, losing my health insurance, then trying to deal with everything that entailed was a HUGE pain in the ass (literally, it physically hurts). I was already considering leaving the USA cause I'm not particularly thrilled with any city here, after living in about 8 different ones at this point (Seattle, Portland,  Sunnyvale, Irvine, Phoenix, El Paso, New York City, Boston).

It's close to the USA east coast to overlap hours, and it offers a digital nomad visa. Thing is... I don't really know how to bring this up with my job or if it's even viable as an option. They *did* tell me I am allowed to work from another country for up to 6 weeks or something, but I think to get a digital nomad visa, you need to stay for 6 months per year so that's not enough\n\nHow would I bring this up?

In July 2025, their project was published on Kickstarter, and in September 2025, the first devices and batteries were shipped.\n\nFor this Linogy test, I was provided with a set consisting of 8 AA batteries, 4 AAA batteries, and the matching charger.\n\n\n\nWhen unpacking the charger and batteries, it is noticeable that a lot of emphasis is placed on sustainability here. Everything is packaged in cardboard.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e30ajbqiehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1ce4ca2f0feabef3cd709ee36437dd665e04f5\n\nThe batteries:\n\nThe batteries are available in the classic AA and AAA formats.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7ch53mpehyf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8731b82721f47d8d7e36d4c0889e522db931618\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekghz6lpehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd2de966f55c7db32d18f47b35f646eec72acdc2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t82ts5lpehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f771aa02686091ddccf14c80f063c78dbfdf8a3a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo5k46lpehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a60cbdd83329f5b062ad5380dd53b15c32dbfeed\n\nThe special feature compared to Ni-MH batteries is the higher voltage of 1.5V. The capacity of the AA batteries is specified as 3600mWh (2400mA). For the AAA batteries, it is 1300mWh (866mA). This puts them at a similar value to conventional batteries, e.g., from Eneloop. The advantage of lithium technology is that the batteries maintain a constant voltage of 1.5V until they are empty. This means that the devices in which they are used can operate for longer. With normal Ni-MH batteries, the voltage continues to decrease as the capacity decreases.\n\nThe service life of the batteries is said to be up to 1200 charging cycles from 0-100%. I was unable to test this during the four weeks I used the batteries.\n\nI used four AA batteries from Linogy in a remote-controlled motorcycle from Baby Born and compared them with the runtime of Eneloop batteries. It should be noted that the manufacturer of the scooter only recommends 1.5V batteries and the Eneloop batteries are already two years old.\n\nWith the Eneloop batteries, the scooter ran for around 40 minutes in continuous operation, although the speed did decrease after 30 minutes. With the Linogy batteries, the scooter ran for a full 55 minutes. In my opinion, this is due to the higher voltage and higher capacity.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have any other devices that drain the batteries quickly. I have been using two batteries in my Razer Basilisk mouse at work for two weeks and have not yet noticed any reduction in capacity using the software.\n\nThe charger:\n\nThe Linogy charger is first connected to a USB-C power supply (not included) using the USB-C cable provided. The power supply should deliver at least 15W.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw0hun2rehyf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a58af26057f7d54f701778a8006e400260438cad\n\nUp to 8 batteries can be charged simultaneously in the charger itself. And not only its own lithium batteries, but also all other 1.2V Ni-MH batteries can be charged.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oliup3yrehyf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fd86239074eccab8d5d6aa1f406387ad73245d6\n\nA voltage measurement is built into the right-hand slot, which allows you to see roughly how full the battery still is.\n\nOnly AA batteries fit into the 8 slots. Four plastic adapters are included for AAA batteries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl39d48tehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68d6cbe76811d57717cf3382dd9e4283ebc2b625\n\nThe charger can detect defective batteries, which is indicated by a red LED, and the charging process is interrupted. The same applies if normal batteries are used.\n\nAnother special feature of the charger is that it has an E-Ink display on which you can see how many batteries you have already charged. And as a little bonus, it shows how much CO2 you have saved compared to normal batteries. A QR code is also displayed. If you scan this with your smartphone, you can plant virtual trees with the CO2 you have saved. The charger feels good to the touch. All edges are rounded. It is made of 65% recycled plastic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dn0fxnbuehyf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39b273f35589d60f871d4ed121597fc1292d3b17\n\nThe batteries (from Linogy) are charged at around 5V and 350mA and are fully charged in just under 3 hours. When all the batteries inserted are charged, the charger recognizes this and a mechanism drops them into the drawers below. The drawer can hold 40 AA batteries. So you always have a bunch of batteries ready to go. Charging is also child's play for our daughter. Just insert the empty batteries at the top and remove the full ones at the bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1usinjvehyf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e725fdf4165b71ebe076d801440ed86a12b6ae9f\n\nThe charger itself costs $79 directly from the manufacturer, and 8 AA batteries cost $39.99.\n\nAt the beginning of 2026, the charger and batteries will also be available to order within the EU and will be delivered from the Netherlands. I can't say yet what the exact prices will be.\n\nComparable batteries are available on Amazon from Asian manufacturers at a similar price.\n\nThe charger, on the other hand, is unique.\n\nOlight currently offers a similar charger (with more functions, but the charged batteries also fall into a drawer). I found a similar charger at Galaxus. However, it only charges two batteries at a time.\n\nThe Linogy charger has replaced a 15-year-old Technoline BC700 charger in our home.\n\nI can't say anything about the longevity of the batteries and the charger yet. I've only been using the device and the batteries for 4 weeks. But if there are any abnormalities, I will report them here.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\nhugoLOST\n\n\n\n"

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope this is not going to be a long post but I really need some support. \n\nI am 29 F, I was born in a bad, 3rd world/developing country in Europe that has a very low life standard and the majority of people struggle in life. I grew up very poor, my dad has never made an effort to work harder in his life to provide for us, it was actually my mom who was working hard and provided for our family. They also are emotionally messed up and for my whole life I struggle with low self-worth due to their criticism and negative mindset. I finished high school and couldn’t afford college. I actually went to college for 2 years before I had to drop out because I had no any support with money and had to work full-time. \nI worked in retail, then moved to call center where I was even promoted to a team manager role. However in our country it’s a normal job environment where you are mentally abused by your managers and are being pushed to the point of burnout, especially if it is an outsourcing company. For example in this job when I was an agent, we literally had to take calls for full 8 hours with 2 min break between calls. So after 2 years, I was so burnt out I quit. I managed to find a data entry type of job as a contractor, which is remote work and I love it. It really is not demanding, and nice work but it pays the most minimum wage which is not enough for anything. I live with my parents, my mom also works in retail for the minimum salary her whole life. My dad is unemployed and also had cancer recently. I have no driver’s licence, I can barely afford clothes I need, and cover the bills and food.\nI was hoping I could find additional job since the one I have right now is very flexible, and it doesn’t take much of my time in the day. So what triggered me today is I had a friend who worked with me on this same job. I really love her and I don’t want to sound like a bad friend but she seriously is irresponsible in a lot of things. At the job, she ghosts people in her personal life if she doesn’t feel like replying, she is very lazy, sleeps in late, doesn’t want to do anything to changer her life. She actually was fired from this job because she didn’t meet KPIs , because she scrolls her phone all day long and always complains she can’t focus. She wasn’t even attending the meetings. So just 2 weeks later a recruiter reached out to her, from a very good company on linkedin and she is hired. The job is literally everything I would dream of in this stage of my life. It’s paid double the amount of my salary, it’s wfh fully flexible. She can work 30 to 40 hrs a week. Having flexible jobs means she can travel however she wants which is so something we like because we go to dance festivals sometimes. I mean I used to go, can’t afford it anymore :( also the job required her to have a Mac which she didn’t have and her boyfriend bought it for her immediately. I had hopes I could maybe try to apply to that same company but once she said you need to have a mac, all of my hopes died.\n\nI am really happy for her. I don’t want to sound envious but how do I have hope something in my life will change and I will also have better days and get out of this dead end job? I know I am capable and intelligent, and I have so many ideas that I would like to try, like doing video editing, trying content creation etc, but almost requires some kind of investment, at least a laptop which I can’t afford. Seems like whatever I try, the door slams shut in my face."

    "selftext": "Not entirely sure where else to post this because this isn't an Intune issue or SCCM issue, it's just a Windows imaging issue in general. But I figure someone here must have dealt with this.\n\nI've been tasked with creating custom Windows 11 images and I'm so close to the finish line. I just need to clear this last hurtle, which is appropriately naming the computer.\n\nOur current naming convention is just CI-%SERIAL% (CI = company initials).\n\nThis is how I have our custom image configured so far:\n\n* Current image based on Windows 11 Pro 24H2 with the October Cumulative Update applied.\n* Provisioning Package applies to Intune enroll the device.\n* Answer file calls custom script during the specialize phase that sets a few custom registry entries then renames the computer before restarting.\n* Answer file reboots into Audit mode and runs some more scripts to:\n   * Install Microsoft Office (latest version over the internet).\n   * Install latest Microsoft Updates via PSWindows Update (again online).\n   * Install Tanium client (our RMM tool).\n   * Syspreps to exit audit mode.\n      * Does not generalize.\n      * Calls a second unattend file that skips the OOBE in the next phase.\n      * Restarts\n* After restarting the second answer file kicks in, skips the OOBE and goes straight to the lock screen to login with Entra creds.\n\nLooking at the logs from my script, the computer name is being set correctly and stays correct throughout the entirety of Audit mode. However, somewhere between Sysprep and the lock screen, the computer name gets reset to Window's default, Desktop-%RAND:8%.\n\nFrom everything I've seen online, Sysprepping without generalizing should keep the existing computer name, and that seems to be the case but there seems to be something that is resetting the computer name.\n\nSo, I just tried setting a static name in that second answer file, during the specialize phase, because it's not an option during the OOBE phase, and it doesn't work either. It still ends up with the default random name.\n\nI'm using Windows System Image Manager to generate the answer files, and it won't give me the option to set the Computer Name field in anything after the audit phase.\n\nThe hope was that if it would take the Computer Name from the answer file, I could have the Sysprep script generate the answer file and inject what should be the correct computer name in there.\n\nMy other thought is that maybe I can skip audit mode altogether and instead have the answer file autologin to an admin account after the OOBE, run these scripts, then restart back to the lock screen. However, I'm not entirely sure how to get the answer file to do that. I'm pretty sure it can, though.\n\nWhy not just use Autopilot?\n\nI know this question is coming and the short answer is that we were, but it keeps breaking on us. That said, we've been using Provisioning Packages to Intune enroll devices in-house with Tanium Provision and it's been rock solid. However, we're creating this image to give to our hardware partner to preload on our laptops and drop ship them to remote users (which is most of our employees at this point).\n\nWe're also very much cloud based and don't have the infrastructure for any tools that require a local network, VPN, etc. So, no SCCM/MECM, etc. However, any other tool recommendations would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWhy not just use the Provisioning Package for all this config?\n\nI tried. I don't know, maybe I'm not using it right, but it just seems to always fail when I do anything more complex beyond the basic wizard. And it's just not very forthcoming as to what even happened when it fails. I'm just using it to enroll in Intune. So far, I've been able to fumble around with answer files enough from never having really touched one before to getting as far as I have and I'm so close. I just have this one more hurdle to jump.\n\nAlso, I don't think it's the provisioning package potentially reapplying a computer name after Sysprep. When I created that provisioning package, I did go into the advanced editor and removed the otherwise forced option to set a computer name. \n\nI mean... I guess it still could be it enforcing a random name 🤔🤔🤔. I'll try investigating that, just in case...\n\nIn the meantime, I copied both answer files below to help give a better idea of what I might be doing wrong.\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Panther\\\\unattend.xml:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n    <unattend xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend\">\n        <settings pass=\"specialize\">\n            <component name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\" processorArchitecture=\"amd64\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" language=\"neutral\" versionScope=\"nonSxS\" xmlns:wcm=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n                <RunSynchronous>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <WillReboot>Never</WillReboot>\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -ImageReleaseName 2510 -ImageRevision 0 -Tag CORP -ConfigImage</Path>\n                        <Description>Customize image</Description>\n                        <Order>1</Order>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <WillReboot>Always</WillReboot>\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -RenameComputer</Path>\n                        <Description>Rename computer</Description>\n                        <Order>2</Order>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                </RunSynchronous>\n            </component>\n        </settings>\n        <settings pass=\"oobeSystem\">\n            <component name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\" processorArchitecture=\"amd64\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" language=\"neutral\" versionScope=\"nonSxS\" xmlns:wcm=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n                <Reseal>\n                    <Mode>Audit</Mode>\n                </Reseal>\n            </component>\n        </settings>\n        <settings pass=\"auditUser\">\n            <component name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\" processorArchitecture=\"amd64\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" language=\"neutral\" versionScope=\"nonSxS\" xmlns:wcm=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n                <RunSynchronous>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <Order>1</Order>\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -InstallOffice</Path>\n                        <WillReboot>Never</WillReboot>\n                        <Description>Install Microsoft Office.</Description>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -InstallMsUpdates</Path>\n                        <WillReboot>Never</WillReboot>\n                        <Description>Install Microsoft Updates</Description>\n                        <Order>2</Order>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <Order>3</Order>\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -InstallTanium</Path>\n                        <Description>Install Tanium Client.</Description>\n                        <WillReboot>Never</WillReboot>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                    <RunSynchronousCommand wcm:action=\"add\">\n                        <Order>4</Order>\n                        <Path>CMD /c PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Windows\\Setup\\Scripts\\Customize-Win11.ps1 -Sysprep -Restart</Path>\n                        <Description>Runs sysprep to exit audit mode and restarts.</Description>\n                        <WillReboot>OnRequest</WillReboot>\n                    </RunSynchronousCommand>\n                </RunSynchronous>\n            </component>\n        </settings>\n        <cpi:offlineImage cpi:source=\"wim:c:/image/lsgs-com-image.wim#CORP -

Rewards include streaming links, DVDs, Blu-rays, film credits and plenty of BTS content.  \n  \nThe film follows Cora, heir to a Scottish fishing empire, and her journalist boyfriend Fraser. They travel to a remote island to uncover her family’s past, but the cameras meant to expose the truth instead capture a monster tied to her family’s history.\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of horror, check out our Kickstarter here:\n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skinmovie/skin-6](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skinmovie/skin-6)\n\nEvery pledge, share or mention helps us bring the film to life.

    "selftext": "Hi, I haven’t bought a car sub or amp in over 20 years so I’m a little out of the loop.  I have the 9 speaker jbl system I think/hope if I just add a decent 12” sealed sub with a mono amp it will hopefully even the system out. It would give me the low end shake that I have come to love. So it seems like I would need an amp with loc and some type of dsp to correct “bass roll off”. I would tap into the front right and left speakers by the amp under the seat. The battery is in the trunk so that is nice. Would would the audio control LC-1.800 High-Power Monoblock Amplifier w/AccuBASS (includes sub remote) handle all my needs? I notice the front doors already rattle like crazy, I may have to fix that along with probaby a ten more rattles that will come up. What do you think, should I give it a go, just live with what I have or do a a different speaker upgrade. Trying not spend more than 1k total. In my day I would buy a head unit, 4 new speakers and two subs with an amp. I was very happy with that. Not sure if my idea is going to sound good or if I just don’t know what I’m talking about and need to spend way more or what. Thank you"

    "selftext": "The TLDR Version:  \n\nNon-religious, child-free by choice, politically liberal, school teacher looking for a physically and emotionally affectionate, good at communicating, even tempered, at least somewhat physically active, homebody leaning partner.  Monogamous long term relationship only. \n\nLonger Version (I like to write):  \n\nI live in West TN. I'm open to connecting with people from anywhere, but experiences during the last year have shown me I'm not good at long distance, and although I don't love this area, I don't see myself leaving unless I were already in a relationship and we moved together. So my preference is for meeting people within in an hour or two of here, or people who can work remotely. \n\nPhysically I’m 5’7, salt and pepper beard, glasses, short brown hair. Average build with a little extra on my stomach. \n\nI’m mentally, financially, and emotionally stable. Quick witted, good sense of humor. Intelligent enough to teach third graders. Personality is a good mix of joking, sarcasm, teasing, playing, flirting, and being positive mixed with seriousness and an overall quiet nature. \n\nI'm not the most emotional person.  Definitely not the hopeless romantic type. But I’m good at making my partner feel valued, good at being affectionate, and good at being part of a team. \n\nI just want to meet someone I feel comfortable around, and then slowly build a meaningful and loving relationship that works for us. \n\nMy hobbies and interests are teaching, language learning, reading, travel, being outdoors, coloring apps, gaming, crossword puzzles, and working on self-improvement. \n\nWhat I hope to find in a partner:\n\nNot religious. Liberal. Does not want kids or has grown kids who are out of the house. Good at communicating. Physically affectionate. Able to disagree and argue without yelling. Enjoys texting here and there throughout the day. Can give and take good-natured sarcasm and teasing (never mean). \n\nThings I would like to do together:\n\nHiking. Taking trips together. Being in the same space but doing our own thing. Spending a lot of time under a blanket together watching shows and movies. Supporting and helping each other with our goals and problems. \n\nPhysical attraction is important of course, but I'm not very picky about body types. I do enjoy walking and hiking with a partner though, so at least someone who is able to do those things. My preferred age range is 35-50 but if you fall a year or two out of there but loved what I wrote, please reach out. "

    "selftext": "I am a 23 years old man. My problem for sure may sound vapid but every single hour of my life has enforced it. My problem is that I'm ugly, not that ugly but a little below average looking. The real problem that derives with it is that I know it's technically that important of a thing and it's pretty useless to worry about it. \nBUT I am struggling with the fact that in my 23 years of life the only thing I got from my life is confirmation about this fact, that looks matter to an insane amount. I tried a bit of therapy but still found myself in situations where my looks completely affected how people treated me. Got told that I am ugly sometimes and usually I am completely invisible to anyone I have not known since I was a child. I think it's important to say that most people that interact with me are \"pleased\" to do so,  but it's just that, as if I am there just to entertain bored people, like they have nothing better to do.\n\nWith women it's even worse. I am a pretty self observing guy and talking with girl friends it always comes out I am \"not attractive\". I am sure that's the problem because I can make anyone laugh but there is this thing in my friends that looks like pity when they talk to me. I can't tell what it is for sure, but it's off putting from my side. They look at me as if I was a starving child sometimes and again, I do not think I look THAT ugly, but maybe I am wrong?\n\nMaybe I am just boring? Or there must be something unsettling about me I do not realize. I feel lonely I gotta say, because everytime I am out with friends evwryone has their gf or bf with them and I am the only lone guy in 10. It saddens me. Maybe I am exoected to do something more? Like really, except for my looks I don't know what I could improve. \n\nI know some gym could do wonders as it did in the past but I still feel like I miss something.\n\nI want to explaun better my experience with therapy too. I used to go before, during and after weightloss around 16-20 years old and sadly, as I said before, it really did not work. \nThe reason is that i lost like 50 pounds at some point and people started treating me like a completely different person, to the point it irked me instead of making me happy because it proved what I dreaded to be true for a while, that looks matter so much more than people make it out to. \n\nThis pretty much ruined me because I constantly, and I mean constantly, face co firmation of this thing. Not in social media mind you, but in real life. Important to say is that I am an incel, so probably people pity me for that? I never had anyone remotely interested with me, or I don't have the mental instruments to u derstand when that happens.\n\nI am at a loss, I feel like love does not exist for someone like me even if I \"believe\" am average looking and don't really know what to do about it. What saddens me the most is that I try to care care of myself but it feels like any social interaction always reminds me to stay in my place and that, indirectly, some things will never be for me and I cannot accept that."

Micro-niche Halloween retrospectives and “cozy November” aesthetics are gaining traction.\n\n\n---\n\n💰 PLATFORM OPPORTUNITIES\n\n🎵 TikTok\n\nTop 3 Money-Making Opportunities\n\n1. “Deinfluencing 2.0” — Budget Holiday Gift Guides\n\nWhy It Works: Consumers are fatigued by excessive consumerism. “Anti-haul” content showing what NOT to buy + affordable alternatives is getting 3-5× engagement over traditional gift guides.\n\nMonetization Angles:\n• Amazon Associates links to budget alternatives\n• Sponsored posts from value brands\n• Digital gift guide templates ($7-15)\n\nSaturation Level: LOW (emerging within last 36 hours)\n\nActionable Prompt: “Create a ‘Don’t Waste Money on These 10 Holiday Gifts’ video showing overpriced viral products vs. smart alternatives under $20”\n\nExample: @smartspending_sarah hit 2.1 M views with “5 Viral Gifts That Flopped vs. What Actually Works”\n\n\n\n2. “Silent POV” Cozy Content with Text Overlays\n\nWhy It Works: No voiceover = lower production barrier.

The pointer has always known me to be home with him since we've had him at 8 weeks old, so I worry he'll have a hard time with the transition. Our boxer/hound will transition fine, he may remember that routine and is usually well mannered. Any tips, advice, suggestions for the transition? At most, it'll be close to 8 1/2 hours alone and he's graduated to being out of his kennel and being allowed to free roam with no incidents for up to 6 hours for several months now, but that's always been occasional.  It's possible he'll adapt fine, I just want to make the transition easier for him if I can."

    "selftext": "We've been in our house a few years but brought our own wireless alarm system.  The house has a rather extensive ADT system already installed and seems to be working as best as it can without service.  We have hard wired sensors on every door and window, motion sensors in every large room, outdoor cameras, the works.  I understand the limitations of self monitoring, but is this the type of system we could get up and going again without paying ADT for monitoring?\n\nWhen we moved in I had an ADT rep come check out the system. He said it was definitely older but still relevant and usable, and it was a very expensive system when it was installed.  The only thing we'd need to get replaced is the battery backup and somehow reset the code as I nor the prior owner have any idea what the code is -- was put in two owners ago.  \n\nSo my questions -- how can we reset the code so we can arm and disarm it, and can we use this with self monitoring.  I get we won't have emergency call outs or remote access and probably the cameras won't work, but I just want to set the alarm at night to get notified if someone tries to get in or during the day when we're away to scare off anyone who does get in.  We use Wyse cameras for most other things, and I can probably setup an IFTTT device to send us text messages if the ADT alarm triggers.  \n\nThanks for any suggestions or feedback.  They quoted us like $65 a month for monitoring, and we're currently paying $55 for our [alarm.com](http://alarm.com) plan -- I'd like to cut this all together yet keep some type of alarm since it's already setup.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt12he7bbhyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9df6c214da84931271215eb7ddffbecdc8ce08df\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afnr4f7bbhyf1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87dce77c77a0bdf29455aa1e46043ab2dae8e999\n\n"

    "selftext": "After my Technical Support Associate contract ended, I tried to get another tech job of any sort, but I got next to no interviews, and I gradually gave up. I also took far too long to settle for that Sales Associate job I have now, because I wasn't sure if a \"teenager\" job like that would count as closing my resume gap, or if it would just be a waste of time and energy.\n\nThe first two pages are a new draft I derived from the Google Docs template in this sub's wiki. The other two pages are my previous resume that my mom and sister helped me with, which I used and updated (but never tailored to individual jobs) until I gave up.\n\n* Would you say I could land a Software Developer job next, or should I get more experience as Technical Support first? Or (this might be out of scope for this sub) should I aim for something other than software development? I liked writing code in college, but my mom says data science would be great for me too. I just want to do *something* on a computer in a cubicle and eventually make six figures.\n* I realize now that the summary I was using is subpar, with junk like \"\\[h\\]ighly effective problem-solver\" and \"\\[t\\]eam collaborator\". Should I redo it, or do I not need a summary in my case anyway?\n* Are the sections in the best order for my case?\n   * I split the work experience into \"relevant\" and \"other\" so the best job could be at the top. Is this the right move?\n   * Here are the two links from the \"Projects\" section (that is, the two I didn't need to anonymize):\n      * [a variation of Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#The_subtraction_game)\n      * [https://snipboard.io/J5R6D0.jpg](https://snipboard.io/J5R6D0.jpg)\n* Is the \"Education\" section good enough?\n   * I didn't have any *responsibility* in the Gaming Club; I would just walk in and join a game (usually Super Smash Bros. 4/Ultimate). Should I just delete that line?\n   * In the old resume, \"Completed 12 Cyber Security Masters Credits\" means I was partway through an accelerated bachelor's to master's program, but lost interest in cybersecurity and dropped it. Should I add that back in, or is it too confusing and unimpressive?\n* Are there any more soft skills you can deduce from my experience that I should add at the bottom?\n* I was using cover letters up to this point, just swapping out the company name and position title, though I *did* have different templates for software development, technical support, etc. However, looking at the wiki, it sounds like I don't need cover letters in my case after all. Would you agree?"

Chen (Behavioral Analysis, HCON)\nSubjects: Pilot K. Vance, Surveyor E. Nunez\n\nINCIDENT BACKGROUND\n\nThe Artemis-9 mapping team (Pilot Vance and Surveyor Nunez) were executing a long duration, hyperspectral scan in Sector Gamma-4. At 14:15 UTC, the mission log recorded a sharp, unexplained dip in all external telemetry data coinciding with a manual activation of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol. The ship, Icarus-II, executed automated corrective return to the stationary scanning platform and powered down non-essential systems. The crew was recovered and returned for immediate evaluation.\n\nPrimary Objective of Interview: To establish the timeline immediately preceding and following the initiation of the emergency protocol.\nINTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (EXCERPTS)\n[14:45:12] Dr. Chen: Pilot Vance, please describe your last coherent memory prior to the incapacitation event.\n\nVance: We were 90% through the long-sweep spectral capture. I remember commenting to Nunez that the processing load was running high. The last thing I distinctly recall is confirming the power drain on the main array. No warning, no pain, just... a full stop.\n[14:46:05] Dr. Chen: Surveyor Nunez, do you corroborate Pilot Vance’s account?\nNunez: Yes, Doctor. The sweep was routine. I was calibrating the filter matrix. I remember the green light on my console flashing, indicating the capture was nearly complete, and then nothing. It wasn't sleep. It was like... a tape being cut.\n\n[14:48:33] Dr. Chen: Describe your first memory upon regaining consciousness.\nVance: Confused. I woke up in the aft galley, near the cryo prep station. My chest harness was loose, but I was otherwise fine. No disorientation, just immediate awareness that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked my internal chronometer: approximately 3 minutes 14 seconds had passed since my last memory.\nNunez: I woke up in the tertiary equipment bay, the one near the recycling unit. I was sitting down, leaning against a storage locker. When I looked around, I had no contextual memory of how I got there. The feeling was profound confusion, like waking up in the wrong apartment.\n\n[14:50:50] Dr. Chen: Did either of you experience physical symptoms, such as headache, vertigo, or auditory hallucinations upon waking?\n\nVance: Negative. I felt slightly thirsty, perhaps. But physically, I was 100%.\n\nNunez: Negative. I felt perfectly normal, which was the most frightening part.\n\n[14:52:19] Dr. Chen: How was the emergency Reversion Protocol initiated?\n\nVance: As soon as I confirmed my location and realized Nunez wasn't at his station, I knew something was fundamentally wrong. The disorientation and memory gap pointed to a potential system breach or a neurotoxin leak. I immediately accessed the nearest auxiliary panel and keyed in the Level-2 Reversion.\n\nNunez: I was en route back to the bridge when the automated alert sounded. Once Reversion was initiated, the ship took control. It cycled the air, sealed all non-essential hatches, and began the automated return vector, bringing us back to the platform.\n\n[14:54:40] Dr. Chen: Did either of you see or hear anything out of the ordinary, either external or internal, that would explain the shared, sudden loss of consciousness?\nVance & Nunez: Negative.\n\nCONCLUSION AND INITIAL FINDINGS\n\nMedical Evaluation: Both subjects underwent comprehensive neurological and biological screening post event. All metrics, including toxicology, brain mapping, and cognitive function tests, returned nominal results. There is no evidence of radiation exposure, physiological distress, or localized brain trauma. The incident remains officially classified as Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI).\n\nInterviewer Recommendation: Based on the crew's uniform adherence to emergency protocols and the lack of physical explanation, Dr. Chen recommends isolating the Icarus-II log data for analysis of the precise moment of the telemetry dip. A systems-based failure is currently the most viable explanation for the temporal and location displacement.\nEnd of Interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON TECHNICAL REPORT: SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW\n\nReport ID: DIAG-A9-210103-NOMINAL\nSubject Incident: Post-UTI System Verification, Icarus-II\nMission: Artemis-9 Stellar Cartography\nReview Date: 2101-03-08\nLead Analyst: Dr. A. P. Zada, Core Engineering\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA comprehensive review of the Icarus-II telemetry logs from the temporal window of interest (2101-03-05, 14:15:00 to 14:18:14 UTC) reveals no systemic failures, internal anomalies, or unauthorized access attempts during the Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI) event. All primary and secondary sub-systems operated within nominal tolerances throughout the 3-minute, 14-second period. The only non-routine event recorded was the manual keying of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol by Pilot Vance at 14:18:14.\n\nConclusion: The ship experienced no detectable internal distress or malfunction capable of causing physical or cognitive impairment to the crew. The incident is not attributable to vessel failure.\n\nSYSTEM-SPECIFIC VERIFICATION (14:15:00 - 14:18:14 UTC)\n\n2.1 Life Support and Environmental Support\n2.2 Propulsion and Navigation\n• The Icarus-II was in a stationary scanning lock (Zero G, Zero Thrust) prior to the event.\n• Dampener Array: Inertial dampeners maintained 99.99% efficiency. No unexpected micro movements detected.\n\n• Navigation Grid Lock: The ship’s navigational computers remained locked onto the fixed stellar coordinates for the duration of the UTI event, only deviating upon Reversion Protocol activation.\n\n2.3 Power and Communication Core\n• Fusion Core Output: Stable at 78% capacity. No power surge, brownout, or internal redistribution of energy occurred. All internal lighting and console power remained constant.\n\n• Internal Network: No packet loss or denial of service event logged on the intraship network (ISN). All brainwave to text translator units maintained connection, though no data was transmitted during the period of incapacitation.\n• Telemetry Dip: The preceding external telemetry dip recorded at 14:15:00 remains the only associated anomaly. Hypothesis: The external dip was a momentary distortion of the sensor array signal, not an actual internal system event.\n\nDISCREPANCY ANALYSIS\n\nThe crew's account (LOG-A9-210103) details a total loss of memory and subsequent awakening in secondary locations (galley, equipment bay).\n\n• Discrepancy: The medical log confirms the crew was not sedated, yet the ship log shows no physical or environmental cause for incapacitation or spatial displacement.\n\n• System Integrity: Based on this review, any cognitive failure or memory loss cannot be attributed to a malfunction of the Icarus-II or its subsystems. The ship functioned perfectly as a controlled environment.\nEnd of Technical Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON INCIDENT REPORT: COMMUNICATION TECHNICIAN LOSS\n\nReport ID: INC-CB-589-KAPTEYN\nSubject Incident: Cognitive Isolation (CI) Event\nTarget: Kapteyn-14 Deep-Space Comm Relay Buoy\nReview Date: 2101-01-15\nLead Analyst: Dr. L. Sharma (Cognitive Physics)\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOn 2101-01-12, Communications Technician (CT) J. B. Singh, aboard the maintenance shuttle Relay-2, initiated standard power diagnostics on the Kapteyn-14 Comm Buoy (Target distance: 2.75 AU from Earth). During the procedure, the buoy’s emergency maneuvering thrusters unexpectedly activated, initiating a rapid drift away from the established grid position. As the shuttle (still docked to the buoy) crossed the 2.80 AU threshold, CT Singh's communications abruptly degraded from coherent, procedural language to simple, incoherent phrases, followed by total cessation of meaningful dialogue. CT Singh is currently alive but non-communicative.\n\n\nPOST-EVENT ANALYSIS AND BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION\n\n3.1 Cognitive State\nFollowing the CI event, the Relay-2 was remotely piloted back to the 2.7 AU mark. CT Singh was secured and evaluated.\n\n• Physiological: Blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and neurological activity (EEG) are within healthy human limits. No toxins or physical damage were found.\n\n• Behavioral: CT Singh exhibits stark, profound cognitive simplification. They respond only to immediate, loud stimuli. When presented with a complex instruction (e.g., \"Press the red button labeled 'A'\"), they stare blankly. When presented with a basic survival action (e.g., placing food into mouth), the action is performed correctly but without any sign of self-awareness or recognition. The Personal Identifier Markers (PIMs) are permanently absent.\n\n3.2 Correlative Data\nThis incident bears a striking and undeniable correlation with the data degradation experienced by the Persephone-7 probe (REPORT 001-A) and the PIM loss noted in the Artemis-9 incident (LOG-A9-210103).\n\n• In all three instances, PIM loss occurs only when the subject crosses the 2.8 AU spatial boundary.\n\n• In all three instances, the subject’s biological status remains completely nominal.\nInitial Hypothesis Adjustment: The \"telemetry dip\" in previous reports (LOG-A9) and the \"thruster failure\" in this report are secondary effects. The primary and recurring variable is the spatial distance from Earth.\n\nIMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. All HCON personnel are immediately recalled from any operation extending beyond 2.7 AU.\n\n2. The boundary at 2.8 AU is hereby \ndesignated the Proximity Null Point (PNP).\n\n3. A dedicated, highly classified project (Operation Deep Line) must be initiated to formally investigate the existence and properties of this spatially defined cognitive constraint.\n\nEnd of Incident Report."

    "selftext": "I am set to start computing and info systems at Athabasca university next month. I'm a bit confused on a few things and it will be my first time attending a fully online school with no professors or lectures so i am very nervous. I am also making this post in hopes that through this i can also find other students who are starting in my program on the same or similar start date, maybe we can join a discord or WhatsApp group and be a little community to help each other out/support one another lol I'm not sure if that's wishful thinking but i figured id give it a try. Back to my questions, I have called and emailed the school's help lines however their answers were very vague and not so helpful which is also worrying me for how these next 4 years are about to go. So if there is anyone who has attended this uni and especially who has completed this program i would love to get any tips or any answers from you from your personal experience! Here are my questions I'm very sorry for how many there are:\n\n1. I received an email saying they received my payment for school and i am set to start on  November 25th however in my message center i was sent confirmations of enrollment for each of my courses and they all say my contract start time is November 1st. So do i start on the 25th or the 1st? i understand it is ultimately up to me since its not scheduled for me but i would like to know if i can start earlier than the 25th. \n\n2. I am super confused how the whole Moodle and Brightspace works. when i click on the course links after i log into myau it takes me to this very disorganized looking page full of information but nothing that makes it clear where to start, what's expected of me and so on. I also am not sure since i see all the information or what i think is all the info for the course it seems like i could start right now if i wanted to? very confused. \n\n3. Who marks all our work and are all the courses self taught or are there some with lectures and a prof? \n\n4. Since it is self paced i read i can finish the degree in 3 years instead of 4, how realistic is this and if i take 5 courses every term is that enough to graduate in 3 years or will i have to take courses in the summer as well in order to make the 3 year mark?\n\n5. Do you have any tips before i begin? for example any studying tips, exam tips, just anything at all? I've bought myself an iPad to organize and take notes on and i have a decent windows computer to study on I'm not sure if i need anything else. I am worried about the aspect of having to teach myself everything as ive always had a prof who helped me through things. I did see tutors send me messages in my message center stating i can reach out if i need help but I've seen a lot of bad reviews about this and that you almost can never rely on this resource so I'm wondering if there are any other resources or anything you know of that could be helpful to my learning journey?\n\n6. For the computing and info systems graduates, what is it like once you graduate in relation to the work field? what were you able to apply to/qualify for and how difficult was it for you to land a job? I've seen a few things online about employers judging degrees coming from Athabasca due to it being a fully self taught online school. I am wondering if i should switch my major to accounting or something that is more guaranteed work once i graduate. I am minoring in web development i am not sure if this will help me land a web dev job later on. \n\n7. I'm worried people will be mean to me for this but my whole goal of taking this program or maybe even switching to accounting later if possible is to get a decent to high paying remote work from home job as a career. i live and plan to always live in a very rural area and i do not have the affordability to get a car or anyway to get to and from work and i am planning on also working on my farm a lot when im not busy working from home. It is just what fits best for me and i understand it is not the most conventional thing but it is my goal upon graduating this program to begin a work from home position with web dev or anything really as long as its a remote position. My internet is not an issue we still get very fast internet here and I'm willing to upgrade if needed. I'm just wondering if there is anyone who has graduated who has applied and or successful gotten work from home jobs after and if so what was the process like/ how realistic is this for me? \n\nThat's all my questions. I am very sorry for it being all over the place i am pretty overwhelmed so my thoughts are all scattered but i tried my best to organize them and make sense. Thank you to anyone that replies and tries to help! \n\n"

Chen (Behavioral Analysis, HCON)\nSubjects: Pilot K. Vance, Surveyor E. Nunez\n\nINCIDENT BACKGROUND\n\nThe Artemis-9 mapping team (Pilot Vance and Surveyor Nunez) were executing a long duration, hyperspectral scan in Sector Gamma-4. At 14:15 UTC, the mission log recorded a sharp, unexplained dip in all external telemetry data coinciding with a manual activation of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol. The ship, Icarus-II, executed automated corrective return to the stationary scanning platform and powered down non-essential systems. The crew was recovered and returned for immediate evaluation.\n\nPrimary Objective of Interview: To establish the timeline immediately preceding and following the initiation of the emergency protocol.\nINTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (EXCERPTS)\n[14:45:12] Dr. Chen: Pilot Vance, please describe your last coherent memory prior to the incapacitation event.\n\nVance: We were 90% through the long-sweep spectral capture. I remember commenting to Nunez that the processing load was running high. The last thing I distinctly recall is confirming the power drain on the main array. No warning, no pain, just... a full stop.\n[14:46:05] Dr. Chen: Surveyor Nunez, do you corroborate Pilot Vance’s account?\nNunez: Yes, Doctor. The sweep was routine. I was calibrating the filter matrix. I remember the green light on my console flashing, indicating the capture was nearly complete, and then nothing. It wasn't sleep. It was like... a tape being cut.\n\n[14:48:33] Dr. Chen: Describe your first memory upon regaining consciousness.\nVance: Confused. I woke up in the aft galley, near the cryo prep station. My chest harness was loose, but I was otherwise fine. No disorientation, just immediate awareness that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked my internal chronometer: approximately 3 minutes 14 seconds had passed since my last memory.\nNunez: I woke up in the tertiary equipment bay, the one near the recycling unit. I was sitting down, leaning against a storage locker. When I looked around, I had no contextual memory of how I got there. The feeling was profound confusion, like waking up in the wrong apartment.\n\n[14:50:50] Dr. Chen: Did either of you experience physical symptoms, such as headache, vertigo, or auditory hallucinations upon waking?\n\nVance: Negative. I felt slightly thirsty, perhaps. But physically, I was 100%.\n\nNunez: Negative. I felt perfectly normal, which was the most frightening part.\n\n[14:52:19] Dr. Chen: How was the emergency Reversion Protocol initiated?\n\nVance: As soon as I confirmed my location and realized Nunez wasn't at his station, I knew something was fundamentally wrong. The disorientation and memory gap pointed to a potential system breach or a neurotoxin leak. I immediately accessed the nearest auxiliary panel and keyed in the Level-2 Reversion.\n\nNunez: I was en route back to the bridge when the automated alert sounded. Once Reversion was initiated, the ship took control. It cycled the air, sealed all non-essential hatches, and began the automated return vector, bringing us back to the platform.\n\n[14:54:40] Dr. Chen: Did either of you see or hear anything out of the ordinary, either external or internal, that would explain the shared, sudden loss of consciousness?\nVance & Nunez: Negative.\n\nCONCLUSION AND INITIAL FINDINGS\n\nMedical Evaluation: Both subjects underwent comprehensive neurological and biological screening post event. All metrics, including toxicology, brain mapping, and cognitive function tests, returned nominal results. There is no evidence of radiation exposure, physiological distress, or localized brain trauma. The incident remains officially classified as Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI).\n\nInterviewer Recommendation: Based on the crew's uniform adherence to emergency protocols and the lack of physical explanation, Dr. Chen recommends isolating the Icarus-II log data for analysis of the precise moment of the telemetry dip. A systems-based failure is currently the most viable explanation for the temporal and location displacement.\nEnd of Interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON TECHNICAL REPORT: SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW\n\nReport ID: DIAG-A9-210103-NOMINAL\nSubject Incident: Post-UTI System Verification, Icarus-II\nMission: Artemis-9 Stellar Cartography\nReview Date: 2101-03-08\nLead Analyst: Dr. A. P. Zada, Core Engineering\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA comprehensive review of the Icarus-II telemetry logs from the temporal window of interest (2101-03-05, 14:15:00 to 14:18:14 UTC) reveals no systemic failures, internal anomalies, or unauthorized access attempts during the Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI) event. All primary and secondary sub-systems operated within nominal tolerances throughout the 3-minute, 14-second period. The only non-routine event recorded was the manual keying of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol by Pilot Vance at 14:18:14.\n\nConclusion: The ship experienced no detectable internal distress or malfunction capable of causing physical or cognitive impairment to the crew. The incident is not attributable to vessel failure.\n\nSYSTEM-SPECIFIC VERIFICATION (14:15:00 - 14:18:14 UTC)\n\n2.1 Life Support and Environmental Support\n2.2 Propulsion and Navigation\n• The Icarus-II was in a stationary scanning lock (Zero G, Zero Thrust) prior to the event.\n• Dampener Array: Inertial dampeners maintained 99.99% efficiency. No unexpected micro movements detected.\n\n• Navigation Grid Lock: The ship’s navigational computers remained locked onto the fixed stellar coordinates for the duration of the UTI event, only deviating upon Reversion Protocol activation.\n\n2.3 Power and Communication Core\n• Fusion Core Output: Stable at 78% capacity. No power surge, brownout, or internal redistribution of energy occurred. All internal lighting and console power remained constant.\n\n• Internal Network: No packet loss or denial of service event logged on the intraship network (ISN).

Sharma (Cognitive Physics)\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOn 2101-01-12, Communications Technician (CT) J. B. Singh, aboard the maintenance shuttle Relay-2, initiated standard power diagnostics on the Kapteyn-14 Comm Buoy (Target distance: 2.75 AU from Earth). During the procedure, the buoy’s emergency maneuvering thrusters unexpectedly activated, initiating a rapid drift away from the established grid position. As the shuttle (still docked to the buoy) crossed the 2.80 AU threshold, CT Singh's communications abruptly degraded from coherent, procedural language to simple, incoherent phrases, followed by total cessation of meaningful dialogue. CT Singh is currently alive but non-communicative.\n\n\nPOST-EVENT ANALYSIS AND BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION\n\n3.1 Cognitive State\nFollowing the CI event, the Relay-2 was remotely piloted back to the 2.7 AU mark. CT Singh was secured and evaluated.\n\n• Physiological: Blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and neurological activity (EEG) are within healthy human limits. No toxins or physical damage were found.\n\n• Behavioral: CT Singh exhibits stark, profound cognitive simplification. They respond only to immediate, loud stimuli. When presented with a complex instruction (e.g., \"Press the red button labeled 'A'\"), they stare blankly. When presented with a basic survival action (e.g., placing food into mouth), the action is performed correctly but without any sign of self-awareness or recognition. The Personal Identifier Markers (PIMs) are permanently absent.\n\n3.2 Correlative Data\nThis incident bears a striking and undeniable correlation with the data degradation experienced by the Persephone-7 probe (REPORT 001-A) and the PIM loss noted in the Artemis-9 incident (LOG-A9-210103).\n\n• In all three instances, PIM loss occurs only when the subject crosses the 2.8 AU spatial boundary.\n\n• In all three instances, the subject’s biological status remains completely nominal.\nInitial Hypothesis Adjustment: The \"telemetry dip\" in previous reports (LOG-A9) and the \"thruster failure\" in this report are secondary effects. The primary and recurring variable is the spatial distance from Earth.\n\nIMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. All HCON personnel are immediately recalled from any operation extending beyond 2.7 AU.\n\n2. The boundary at 2.8 AU is hereby \ndesignated the Proximity Null Point (PNP).\n\n3. A dedicated, highly classified project (Operation Deep Line) must be initiated to formally investigate the existence and properties of this spatially defined cognitive constraint.\n\nEnd of Incident Report."

    "selftext": "I'll try to post helpful details about the city, and areas you'd consider. If you live here please add your experience in the comments.\n\nMyrtle Beach is one of the fastest growing areas in the country (percentage-wise) probably because it had a lower population to begin with compared to other cities.\n\nThe city has a strong vacation identity, but residents experience a much calmer, more everyday coastal lifestyle depending on which neighborhood they choose. \n\nSome areas feel like classic beach town neighborhoods, while others feel suburban, and the tourist core feels completely different from both.\n\n# The Vibe\n\nMyrtle Beach is known for its wide sandy beaches, golf courses, boardwalk entertainment, and warm-weather coastal atmosphere. \n\nThe city has an easygoing pace, but because tourism drives much of the economy, certain areas can feel crowded, congested, and transient. \n\nThe central tourist district experiences the highest levels of crime and foot traffic, while the surrounding residential areas are noticeably quieter and more community-focused. \n\nWhere you choose to live will determine most of what your day-to-day life feels like.\n\n# Weather\n\nThe climate is humid and subtropical. \n\nSummers are long, hot, and very humid, with temperatures commonly in the upper eighties to low nineties. \n\nWinters are mild, generally in the upper fifties to lower sixties, and freezing temperatures are uncommon. \n\nRain occurs throughout the year. \n\nHurricane season lasts from June through November, and storms can bring strong winds, flooding, and storm surge.\n\n# Economy and Job Market\n\nTourism is the backbone of the local economy, but healthcare and construction also play major roles. \n\nThe region is supported by several large hospital systems, the county school district, resort companies, and year-round service and hospitality employers. \n\nThe median household income is about $53,679 and the unemployment rate is around 4.6 percent. \n\nGrowth in healthcare and residential development has helped diversify employment options in recent years.\n\n# Cost of Living and Taxes\n\nThe overall cost of living is about seven percent below the national average. \n\nHousing is where residents see the greatest savings, since home prices are generally about thirty percent lower than the national average. \n\nUtilities tend to cost more than average, often because air conditioning runs heavily during the long humid summers. \n\nGroceries are slightly higher than average. \n\nThe total sales tax rate in the city is nine percent. \n\nSouth Carolina’s top state income tax rate is 6.2 percent. \n\nProperty taxes are significantly lower here than in most states. For example, a primary residence valued at $300,000 would have an annual property tax bill of about $1,050. Investment properties and second homes are taxed at higher rates.\n\n# Transportation\n\nMost residents rely on a car for daily life. \n\nWhile the tourist strip and The Market Common area have walkable sections, the majority of neighborhoods and shopping centers are spread out. \n\nThe average commute time is about twenty-three minutes. \n\nThe main routes are US-17 for north-south travel along the coast and US-501 for travel inland toward Conway. \n\nThe Coast RTA bus system provides local and regional service, but coverage is limited. \n\nMyrtle Beach International Airport offers nonstop flights to more than fifty destinations, which is notable for a city of this size.\n\n# Healthcare\n\nMyrtle Beach has strong medical access for its size. \n\nGrand Strand Health, McLeod Health, Tidelands Health, and Conway Medical Center each operate major facilities in the region, providing trauma care, cardiology, surgical specialties, and general hospital services.\n\n# Lifestyle and Community\n\nLife here can be very active or very relaxed depending on your interests. \n\nThe restaurant scene includes classic seafood buffets, locally owned diners, and newer upscale dining areas in The Market Common and Grande Dunes. \n\nThe beach is the main recreational draw, but there are also state parks, golf courses, river access points, boardwalk entertainment areas, theaters, music venues, and regular seasonal festivals. \n\nThe population includes a mix of long-term residents, families, remote workers, and retirees. The median age is about forty-seven.\n\nHere are some neighborhood/spots to consider:\n\n# Carolina Forest\n\nFamily-oriented suburb, inland.  \nWalkability: Car-dependent  \nCrime: Low  \nSchools: Excellent  \nHouse price (3 bed): $350k–$450k\n\n# North Myrtle Beach\n\nQuieter beach-town feel, more residential.  \nWalkability: Car-dependent  \nCrime: Low to Medium  \nSchools: Excellent  \nHouse price (3 bed): $380k–$470k\n\n# Surfside Beach\n\nSmall, friendly “Family Beach” community.  \nWalkability: Car-dependent  \nCrime: Very Low  \nSchools: Excellent  \nHouse price (3 bed): $370k–$480k\n\n# The Market Common\n\nModern, planned community with shops and parks.  \nWalkability: Moderately walkable  \nCrime: Low  \nSchools: Mixed  \nHouse price (3 bed): $350k–$480k\n\n# Downtown Myrtle Beach (Boardwalk Area)\n\nTourist-heavy, busy, and transient.  \nWalkability: Car-dependent  \nCrime: Very High  \nSchools: Mixed  \nHouse price (3 bed): $280k–$415k\n\n# Grande Dunes\n\nLuxury, resort-style living.  \nWalkability: Car-dependent  \nCrime: Extremely Low  \nSchools: Excellent  \nHouse price (3 bed): $650k+\n\n"

Chen (Behavioral Analysis, HCON)\nSubjects: Pilot K. Vance, Surveyor E. Nunez\n\nINCIDENT BACKGROUND\n\nThe Artemis-9 mapping team (Pilot Vance and Surveyor Nunez) were executing a long duration, hyperspectral scan in Sector Gamma-4. At 14:15 UTC, the mission log recorded a sharp, unexplained dip in all external telemetry data coinciding with a manual activation of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol. The ship, Icarus-II, executed automated corrective return to the stationary scanning platform and powered down non-essential systems. The crew was recovered and returned for immediate evaluation.\n\nPrimary Objective of Interview: To establish the timeline immediately preceding and following the initiation of the emergency protocol.\nINTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (EXCERPTS)\n[14:45:12] Dr. Chen: Pilot Vance, please describe your last coherent memory prior to the incapacitation event.\n\nVance: We were 90% through the long-sweep spectral capture. I remember commenting to Nunez that the processing load was running high. The last thing I distinctly recall is confirming the power drain on the main array. No warning, no pain, just... a full stop.\n[14:46:05] Dr. Chen: Surveyor Nunez, do you corroborate Pilot Vance’s account?\nNunez: Yes, Doctor. The sweep was routine. I was calibrating the filter matrix. I remember the green light on my console flashing, indicating the capture was nearly complete, and then nothing. It wasn't sleep. It was like... a tape being cut.\n\n[14:48:33] Dr. Chen: Describe your first memory upon regaining consciousness.\nVance: Confused. I woke up in the aft galley, near the cryo prep station. My chest harness was loose, but I was otherwise fine. No disorientation, just immediate awareness that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked my internal chronometer: approximately 3 minutes 14 seconds had passed since my last memory.\nNunez: I woke up in the tertiary equipment bay, the one near the recycling unit. I was sitting down, leaning against a storage locker. When I looked around, I had no contextual memory of how I got there. The feeling was profound confusion, like waking up in the wrong apartment.\n\n[14:50:50] Dr. Chen: Did either of you experience physical symptoms, such as headache, vertigo, or auditory hallucinations upon waking?\n\nVance: Negative. I felt slightly thirsty, perhaps. But physically, I was 100%.\n\nNunez: Negative. I felt perfectly normal, which was the most frightening part.\n\n[14:52:19] Dr. Chen: How was the emergency Reversion Protocol initiated?\n\nVance: As soon as I confirmed my location and realized Nunez wasn't at his station, I knew something was fundamentally wrong. The disorientation and memory gap pointed to a potential system breach or a neurotoxin leak. I immediately accessed the nearest auxiliary panel and keyed in the Level-2 Reversion.\n\nNunez: I was en route back to the bridge when the automated alert sounded. Once Reversion was initiated, the ship took control. It cycled the air, sealed all non-essential hatches, and began the automated return vector, bringing us back to the platform.\n\n[14:54:40] Dr. Chen: Did either of you see or hear anything out of the ordinary, either external or internal, that would explain the shared, sudden loss of consciousness?\nVance & Nunez: Negative.\n\nCONCLUSION AND INITIAL FINDINGS\n\nMedical Evaluation: Both subjects underwent comprehensive neurological and biological screening post event. All metrics, including toxicology, brain mapping, and cognitive function tests, returned nominal results. There is no evidence of radiation exposure, physiological distress, or localized brain trauma. The incident remains officially classified as Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI).\n\nInterviewer Recommendation: Based on the crew's uniform adherence to emergency protocols and the lack of physical explanation, Dr. Chen recommends isolating the Icarus-II log data for analysis of the precise moment of the telemetry dip. A systems-based failure is currently the most viable explanation for the temporal and location displacement.\nEnd of Interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON TECHNICAL REPORT: SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW\n\nReport ID: DIAG-A9-210103-NOMINAL\nSubject Incident: Post-UTI System Verification, Icarus-II\nMission: Artemis-9 Stellar Cartography\nReview Date: 2101-03-08\nLead Analyst: Dr. A. P. Zada, Core Engineering\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA comprehensive review of the Icarus-II telemetry logs from the temporal window of interest (2101-03-05, 14:15:00 to 14:18:14 UTC) reveals no systemic failures, internal anomalies, or unauthorized access attempts during the Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI) event. All primary and secondary sub-systems operated within nominal tolerances throughout the 3-minute, 14-second period. The only non-routine event recorded was the manual keying of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol by Pilot Vance at 14:18:14.\n\nConclusion: The ship experienced no detectable internal distress or malfunction capable of causing physical or cognitive impairment to the crew. The incident is not attributable to vessel failure.\n\nSYSTEM-SPECIFIC VERIFICATION (14:15:00 - 14:18:14 UTC)\n\n2.1 Life Support and Environmental Support\n2.2 Propulsion and Navigation\n• The Icarus-II was in a stationary scanning lock (Zero G, Zero Thrust) prior to the event.\n• Dampener Array: Inertial dampeners maintained 99.99% efficiency. No unexpected micro movements detected.\n\n• Navigation Grid Lock: The ship’s navigational computers remained locked onto the fixed stellar coordinates for the duration of the UTI event, only deviating upon Reversion Protocol activation.\n\n2.3 Power and Communication Core\n• Fusion Core Output: Stable at 78% capacity. No power surge, brownout, or internal redistribution of energy occurred. All internal lighting and console power remained constant.\n\n• Internal Network: No packet loss or denial of service event logged on the intraship network (ISN). All brainwave to text translator units maintained connection, though no data was transmitted during the period of incapacitation.\n• Telemetry Dip: The preceding external telemetry dip recorded at 14:15:00 remains the only associated anomaly. Hypothesis: The external dip was a momentary distortion of the sensor array signal, not an actual internal system event.\n\nDISCREPANCY ANALYSIS\n\nThe crew's account (LOG-A9-210103) details a total loss of memory and subsequent awakening in secondary locations (galley, equipment bay).\n\n• Discrepancy: The medical log confirms the crew was not sedated, yet the ship log shows no physical or environmental cause for incapacitation or spatial displacement.\n\n• System Integrity: Based on this review, any cognitive failure or memory loss cannot be attributed to a malfunction of the Icarus-II or its subsystems. The ship functioned perfectly as a controlled environment.\nEnd of Technical Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON INCIDENT REPORT: COMMUNICATION TECHNICIAN LOSS\n\nReport ID: INC-CB-589-KAPTEYN\nSubject Incident: Cognitive Isolation (CI) Event\nTarget: Kapteyn-14 Deep-Space Comm Relay Buoy\nReview Date: 2101-01-15\nLead Analyst: Dr. L.

    "selftext": "Hi! I just came back from a 10-day land-based solo trip through the Galapagos and wanted to share all the details about it in case it can help any of you trying to plan a similar trip, as I know I essentially lived on this subreddit trying to put together information myself.\n\nContext: 22M solo traveler, late October 2025\n\nItinerary:\n\nDay 1: Flew from Quito to San Cristobal\n\nIf you’re flying out of Quito, you will likely have a short layover in Guayaquil, unless you’re lucky enough to find a nonstop flight on your date. **Make sure the flight number is the same on both the UIO-GYE and GYE-SCY or GPS legs.** That means you won’t have to get off the plane in Guayaquil and makes the short connection time much easier.\n\nActivities:\n\n* Walked around the main port where there are tons of sea lions, iguanas, crabs, and occasionally a turtle passing by. \n* Walked to Playa Mann where you share the beach with dozens of sea lions\n* Went to Playa La Loberia where the water is a little clearer to snorkel and more sea lions. I walked there (30 min) and took a $4 taxi back to town\n\nDay 2: 360 Tour\n\nThank you to those of you who suggested the 360 tour over the Kicker Rock tour–you were right! Our first stop of the day was Kicker Rock, and unfortunately we didn’t really see anything other than reefs and fish while snorkeling. However, the massive rock itself is insanely cool to see as it towers above you. \n\nSardine Bay was the second snorkel, which was beautiful, but  we also didn’t really see much and the water wasn’t very clear. \n\nHowever, the last stop, Bahia Rosa Blanca was incredible!! One of the most beautiful beaches I’ve ever seen, and the snorkeling spot a few steps away was where we saw a ray, tons white tipped reef sharks, and turtles. Truly the highlight of the day.\n\nI paid $150 in cash for this tour from Nazca Travel–included a wetsuit, snorkel, fins, and Go-Pro rental.\n\nDay 3: Galapaguera, Cerro Tijeretas, Playa Punta Carola\n\nThis day was on my own pace going to the last few stops around San Cristobal. I hired a taxi for $40 round trip to take me to Galapaguera to get up close to the tortoises. You can also do a highlands tour, but it didn’t seem too interesting to me. \n\nThen I walked to Playa Punta Carola where I was literally the only one there and had the long beach full of sea lions to myself – amazing. \n\nI continued the hike over to Cerro Tijeratas where there’s a cool view point of the lagoon you can snorkel in. \n\nDay 4: Ferry to Santa Cruz and Playa Tortuga\n\nEarly wake up on this day to be at the port at 6am for the 7am ferry departure. \n\nArrived in Santa Cruz on time at 9, and spent the rest of the day walking around town, picking up my wetsuit for the next day’s tour, and headed to Playa Tortuga Bay. \n\nThe walk there wasn’t bad at all, about 40 mins and mostly flat. The beach is gorgeous but the current was too strong to swim (they have warning flags), but that didn’t stop me from taking a quick dip. Iguanas everywhere. You can continue the walk to Playa Manza which is a calmer beach with more people hanging out, but wasn't as pretty.\n\nDay 5: Bartolomé Tour\n\nThis tour was okay, and I knew what I was getting into. The highlights were the really informative and passionate guide, and the landscapes that look like a different planet. The snorkel portion of the tour at Sullivan Bay was also great. Clear water, lots of schools of fish, turtles, and a ray. But the boat ride back to Santa Cruz is loooong, plus the 40 min drive each way from the channel to town. The tour was fun, but this is one of the more expensive ones (which makes sense due to the long boat journey), and for me, it wasn’t worth the price. \n\nI paid $250 and booked online with Galapagos Dreams. \n\nDay 6: Discovery Dive at North Seymour\n\nThis was the best day of my trip hands down, because diving beats snorkeling any day, even the discovery dive. The dive was operated with Shark Bay diving and they are EXCELLENT. Whether you’re certified or not I would 100% go with them. We got up close to reef sharks, hundreds of fish, rays, and turtles. At the second spot, we swam through a massive bait ball – it was unreal. The certified divers were looking for hammerheads but had no luck that day, but a few of them said they’d seen them earlier in the week, so definitely possible!\n\nI paid $240 and booked online through Aquaventures, and you have the option for a second dive or snorkel.\n\nDay 7: Transfer to Isabela\n\nSuper chill day. Ferry left and arrived on time but we had to pay $10 port tax which caught me off guard. They didn’t seem to have this tax on the other islands. Spent essentially the rest of the day at the beach, where there were hundreds and hundreds of iguanas.\n\nDay 8: Túneles tour\n\nHonestly after the dive, snorkeling stopped being as fun lol. The tour was still nice. The first stop at the lava tunnels was cool to get up close to blue-footed boobies and swim through the formations, but there wasn’t too much marine life. The second spot had more wildlife: turtles, sharks, and a sea horse! But the water was full of sediment that caused it to look super green and murky. \n\nI paid $110 in cash with Rosedelco. They’re a great and very professional agency!\n\nDay 9: Tintoreras tour\n\nI was torn between this tour and Sierra Negra for my last day, but I ended up choosing Tintoreras as I wasn’t feeling a full-day tour with a long car ride. I did pretty much only water activities the whole trip so maybe the volcano tour might have been good to switch it up. But I enjoyed getting super close to turtles and marine iguanas swimming. After the tour I ended up snorkeling with a sea lion at Concha Perla, which i was waiting to do since the start of my trip!\n\nI paid $50, booking a day in advance with Pahoehoe. I rented a camera from them for $25. Concha Perla is free, but rented a $4 snorkel at the entrance.\n\nDay 10-11: Isabela exploring, return to Santa Cruz, fly out\n\nI spent my last day walking on the trail to the Wall of Tears but didn’t make it all the way. I mainly did it in order to spot wild tortoises along the trail. I’d say I walked decently far but didn’t end up seeing any. Maybe renting a bike would’ve been the wiser option, oops. There were a few cool spots like a little beach, mangroves, and a lava cave on the way. I caught the 3pm ferry back to Santa Cruz, had a chill evening, and flew nonstop to Quito the next morning!\n\nOverall, I loved this trip! In total I spent roughly $1900, excluding flights. As a solo budget traveler who had the opportunity to go to the Galapagos, I think a land-based trip was the best decision for me considering all factors. But I totally see the appeal of a cruise with more packed days and access to more remote areas of the islands.  \n\nI hope this is helpful, and I’m happy to answer any questions! "

Chen (Behavioral Analysis, HCON)\nSubjects: Pilot K. Vance, Surveyor E. Nunez\n\nINCIDENT BACKGROUND\n\nThe Artemis-9 mapping team (Pilot Vance and Surveyor Nunez) were executing a long duration, hyperspectral scan in Sector Gamma-4. At 14:15 UTC, the mission log recorded a sharp, unexplained dip in all external telemetry data coinciding with a manual activation of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol. The ship, Icarus-II, executed automated corrective return to the stationary scanning platform and powered down non-essential systems. The crew was recovered and returned for immediate evaluation.\n\nPrimary Objective of Interview: To establish the timeline immediately preceding and following the initiation of the emergency protocol.\nINTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (EXCERPTS)\n[14:45:12] Dr. Chen: Pilot Vance, please describe your last coherent memory prior to the incapacitation event.\n\nVance: We were 90% through the long-sweep spectral capture. I remember commenting to Nunez that the processing load was running high. The last thing I distinctly recall is confirming the power drain on the main array. No warning, no pain, just... a full stop.\n[14:46:05] Dr. Chen: Surveyor Nunez, do you corroborate Pilot Vance’s account?\nNunez: Yes, Doctor. The sweep was routine. I was calibrating the filter matrix. I remember the green light on my console flashing, indicating the capture was nearly complete, and then nothing. It wasn't sleep. It was like... a tape being cut.\n\n[14:48:33] Dr. Chen: Describe your first memory upon regaining consciousness.\nVance: Confused. I woke up in the aft galley, near the cryo prep station. My chest harness was loose, but I was otherwise fine. No disorientation, just immediate awareness that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked my internal chronometer: approximately 3 minutes 14 seconds had passed since my last memory.\nNunez: I woke up in the tertiary equipment bay, the one near the recycling unit. I was sitting down, leaning against a storage locker. When I looked around, I had no contextual memory of how I got there. The feeling was profound confusion, like waking up in the wrong apartment.\n\n[14:50:50] Dr. Chen: Did either of you experience physical symptoms, such as headache, vertigo, or auditory hallucinations upon waking?\n\nVance: Negative. I felt slightly thirsty, perhaps. But physically, I was 100%.\n\nNunez: Negative. I felt perfectly normal, which was the most frightening part.\n\n[14:52:19] Dr. Chen: How was the emergency Reversion Protocol initiated?\n\nVance: As soon as I confirmed my location and realized Nunez wasn't at his station, I knew something was fundamentally wrong. The disorientation and memory gap pointed to a potential system breach or a neurotoxin leak. I immediately accessed the nearest auxiliary panel and keyed in the Level-2 Reversion.\n\nNunez: I was en route back to the bridge when the automated alert sounded. Once Reversion was initiated, the ship took control. It cycled the air, sealed all non-essential hatches, and began the automated return vector, bringing us back to the platform.\n\n[14:54:40] Dr. Chen: Did either of you see or hear anything out of the ordinary, either external or internal, that would explain the shared, sudden loss of consciousness?\nVance & Nunez: Negative.\n\nCONCLUSION AND INITIAL FINDINGS\n\nMedical Evaluation: Both subjects underwent comprehensive neurological and biological screening post event. All metrics, including toxicology, brain mapping, and cognitive function tests, returned nominal results. There is no evidence of radiation exposure, physiological distress, or localized brain trauma. The incident remains officially classified as Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI).\n\nInterviewer Recommendation: Based on the crew's uniform adherence to emergency protocols and the lack of physical explanation, Dr. Chen recommends isolating the Icarus-II log data for analysis of the precise moment of the telemetry dip. A systems-based failure is currently the most viable explanation for the temporal and location displacement.\nEnd of Interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON TECHNICAL REPORT: SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW\n\nReport ID: DIAG-A9-210103-NOMINAL\nSubject Incident: Post-UTI System Verification, Icarus-II\nMission: Artemis-9 Stellar Cartography\nReview Date: 2101-03-08\nLead Analyst: Dr. A. P. Zada, Core Engineering\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA comprehensive review of the Icarus-II telemetry logs from the temporal window of interest (2101-03-05, 14:15:00 to 14:18:14 UTC) reveals no systemic failures, internal anomalies, or unauthorized access attempts during the Unexplained Temporary Incapacitation (UTI) event. All primary and secondary sub-systems operated within nominal tolerances throughout the 3-minute, 14-second period. The only non-routine event recorded was the manual keying of the Level-2 Emergency Reversion Protocol by Pilot Vance at 14:18:14.\n\nConclusion: The ship experienced no detectable internal distress or malfunction capable of causing physical or cognitive impairment to the crew. The incident is not attributable to vessel failure.\n\nSYSTEM-SPECIFIC VERIFICATION (14:15:00 - 14:18:14 UTC)\n\n2.1 Life Support and Environmental Support\n2.2 Propulsion and Navigation\n• The Icarus-II was in a stationary scanning lock (Zero G, Zero Thrust) prior to the event.\n• Dampener Array: Inertial dampeners maintained 99.99% efficiency. No unexpected micro movements detected.\n\n• Navigation Grid Lock: The ship’s navigational computers remained locked onto the fixed stellar coordinates for the duration of the UTI event, only deviating upon Reversion Protocol activation.\n\n2.3 Power and Communication Core\n• Fusion Core Output: Stable at 78% capacity. No power surge, brownout, or internal redistribution of energy occurred. All internal lighting and console power remained constant.\n\n• Internal Network: No packet loss or denial of service event logged on the intraship network (ISN). All brainwave to text translator units maintained connection, though no data was transmitted during the period of incapacitation.\n• Telemetry Dip: The preceding external telemetry dip recorded at 14:15:00 remains the only associated anomaly. Hypothesis: The external dip was a momentary distortion of the sensor array signal, not an actual internal system event.\n\nDISCREPANCY ANALYSIS\n\nThe crew's account (LOG-A9-210103) details a total loss of memory and subsequent awakening in secondary locations (galley, equipment bay).\n\n• Discrepancy: The medical log confirms the crew was not sedated, yet the ship log shows no physical or environmental cause for incapacitation or spatial displacement.\n\n• System Integrity: Based on this review, any cognitive failure or memory loss cannot be attributed to a malfunction of the Icarus-II or its subsystems. The ship functioned perfectly as a controlled environment.\nEnd of Technical Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCON INCIDENT REPORT: COMMUNICATION TECHNICIAN LOSS\n\nReport ID: INC-CB-589-KAPTEYN\nSubject Incident: Cognitive Isolation (CI) Event\nTarget: Kapteyn-14 Deep-Space Comm Relay Buoy\nReview Date: 2101-01-15\nLead Analyst: Dr. L. Sharma (Cognitive Physics)\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOn 2101-01-12, Communications Technician (CT) J. B. Singh, aboard the maintenance shuttle Relay-2, initiated standard power diagnostics on the Kapteyn-14 Comm Buoy (Target distance: 2.75 AU from Earth). During the procedure, the buoy’s emergency maneuvering thrusters unexpectedly activated, initiating a rapid drift away from the established grid position. As the shuttle (still docked to the buoy) crossed the 2.80 AU threshold, CT Singh's communications abruptly degraded from coherent, procedural language to simple, incoherent phrases, followed by total cessation of meaningful dialogue. CT Singh is currently alive but non-communicative.\n\n\nPOST-EVENT ANALYSIS AND BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION\n\n3.1 Cognitive State\nFollowing the CI event, the Relay-2 was remotely piloted back to the 2.7 AU mark. CT Singh was secured and evaluated.\n\n• Physiological: Blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and neurological activity (EEG) are within healthy human limits. No toxins or physical damage were found.\n\n• Behavioral: CT Singh exhibits stark, profound cognitive simplification. They respond only to immediate, loud stimuli. When presented with a complex instruction (e.g., \"Press the red button labeled 'A'\"), they stare blankly. When presented with a basic survival action (e.g., placing food into mouth), the action is performed correctly but without any sign of self-awareness or recognition. The Personal Identifier Markers (PIMs) are permanently absent.\n\n3.2 Correlative Data\nThis incident bears a striking and undeniable correlation with the data degradation experienced by the Persephone-7 probe (REPORT 001-A) and the PIM loss noted in the Artemis-9 incident (LOG-A9-210103).\n\n• In all three instances, PIM loss occurs only when the subject crosses the 2.8 AU spatial boundary.\n\n• In all three instances, the subject’s biological status remains completely nominal.\nInitial Hypothesis Adjustment: The \"telemetry dip\" in previous reports (LOG-A9) and the \"thruster failure\" in this report are secondary effects. The primary and recurring variable is the spatial distance from Earth.\n\nIMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. All HCON personnel are immediately recalled from any operation extending beyond 2.7 AU.\n\n2. The boundary at 2.8 AU is hereby \ndesignated the Proximity Null Point (PNP).\n\n3. A dedicated, highly classified project (Operation Deep Line) must be initiated to formally investigate the existence and properties of this spatially defined cognitive constraint.\n\nEnd of Incident Report."

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nI could use some expertise trying to diagnose an Artika ceiling fan. “Austin” model. One day it stopped working. Sometimes the fan will spin in reverse a couple degrees, sometimes in forward. Maybe 2-4 glitches of movement & that’s it. If I turn off the fan with the remote or wall switch, I’ll get the same few degrees of random operation. The lights always work fine & get an audible beep when any remote button is pressed. I’m not great at circuit board repair, it’s a brushless fan. The circuit board looks ok. No broken cold solder joints or anything burnt/loose. The transformer is sending out 24 volts DC. I don’t think this has a start/run capacitor? On the bench the fan connector will get sporadic voltage & does it few degrees of movement. I applied 24 volts directly to the motor & got the same random movement. It’s a 3 wire connector so I’m guessing it won’t bench test without the signal wire hooked up to the PCB?  I can’t find any information online. Sorry for the bad pictures. I can send more if anyone wants. Any help is appreciated. \n\nThank you!"

All the theories, the discussions, yes, even the discourse, they have been made me feel alive again.

    "selftext": "Good evening readers — wherever you are, from Lucknow’s chai to London’s drizzle ☕🌧️\n\nEver wondered why some people effortlessly fly abroad while others stay rooted in their homeland?\nIs it luck, karma, or cosmic geography?\nLet’s decode this fascinating pattern — the astrological migration code.\n\n\n✈️ 1️⃣ The 9th & 12th House Connection — The Cosmic Departure Gate\n\nIn Vedic astrology, the 9th house represents fortune, destiny, and long journeys.\nThe 12th house represents foreign lands, isolation, and liberation.\nWhen these two connect through lords, aspects, or nakshatras, the chart whispers — “your soul will travel.”\n\nFor example:\n\nLagna lord in the 12th → native feels drawn to other cultures.\n9th lord in the 12th → destiny opens through foreign experiences.\nJupiter or Venus influencing both → knowledge and love bloom abroad.\nYou can call it cosmic wanderlust.\n\n🧭 2️⃣ Rahu — The Ultimate Foreigner\n\nRahu doesn’t understand borders.\nWherever Rahu touches, it dissolves limits — caste, country, or comfort zone.\nIf Rahu connects with your 9th, 10th, or 12th house, expect a life that moves beyond your postal code.\nRahu in the 9th gives the hunger to explore other ideologies;\nRahu in the 10th shifts your career across continents;\nRahu in the 12th creates fascination with life abroad — even if you never migrate physically, your mind always travels.\nRahu says: “Be more than where you were born.”\n\n\n🌞 3️⃣ Sun, Mercury, and the “Recognition Factor”\n\nMoving abroad isn’t just about distance — it’s about visibility.\nWhen the Sun or Mercury rule or aspect the 9th/12th, the native’s recognition grows through communication, education, or professional excellence in a foreign setup.\nSun in the 9th or 12th → Government / multinational associations.\nMercury there → success through language, data, or negotiation skills.\nEver noticed how some Indians settle in UK or US and suddenly “shine”?\nThat’s Solar-Mercurial light finding a global stage.\n\n💼 4️⃣ The 10th House Trigger — Career Abroad\n\nThe 10th is karmasthana — your workplace.\nIf the 10th lord joins or aspects 12th, your karma naturally flows to foreign lands.\nVenus or Mercury as 10th lords often bring corporate or creative exposure abroad.\n\nExample:\nA Taurus ascendant with Saturn (career) in Pisces (12th) usually finds stability only after working in a structured system abroad — that’s karmic engineering at play.\n\n\n💎 5️⃣ The Timing — When Planets Stamp Your Visa\n\nYou can have every “foreign combination” and still stay in Lucknow — until your dasha activates the promise.\nRahu–Venus or Rahu–Jupiter → travel / PR approvals / global projects.\nSaturn–Jupiter → career relocation.\nMercury–Moon → short foreign stays for study or training.\n\n\nTransit tip:\nWhen Jupiter transits your 12th or aspects 9th/10th, your passport gets busy.\nWhen Rahu transits 3rd/9th axis, opportunities knock from unexpected countries.\n\n\n💫 6️⃣ But Not All Who Wander, Win\n\nHere’s the twist most people miss:\nForeign stay isn’t always “progress.”\nFor some, it’s isolation, for others, evolution.\nIf the 12th lord is weak or afflicted, you may feel uprooted, not elevated.\n\nAstrology doesn’t promise foreign success — it maps foreign experience. The outcome depends on your karmic maturity. That’s why two people go abroad one builds an empire, the other longs to come home.\n\n🌙 7️⃣ The Emotional Migration — Moon’s Role\n\nMoon decides how you “feel” about relocation.\nMoon connected to Rahu, 9th or 12th makes you emotionally nomadic. You adapt quickly, love global diversity. But if Moon is afflicted or in fixed signs, your heart stays in the homeland even if you’re sipping coffee in London. Sometimes migration isn’t about place it’s about peace.\n\n\n🔮 8️⃣ The Modern Karma: “Digital Abroad”\n\nIn this new age, even remote workers and digital creators live their 12th-house karma online. A person teaching astrology on Reddit from India but guiding clients in Europe?\nThat’s 12th house fulfilment in 5G form!\nThe universe doesn’t need airports anymore; only Wi-Fi and wisdom.\n\n\n🕊️ 9️⃣ Remedies & Realignment\n\nIf your chart strongly points abroad but progress feels blocked:\n\n1. Strengthen the 9th lord through donation and study.\n2. Offer water to Sun for clarity in decision-making.\n3. Travel East on Thursdays — symbolic activation of Jupiter’s expansion.\n4. Keep learning foreign languages — Rahu loves adaptation.\n\n\nRemember: destiny opens only when you prepare practically and spiritually.\n\n\n✨ 10️⃣ Closing Thought\n\n “The stars don’t care for borders; they only care for evolution.” Some souls grow roots, others grow wings. If your chart whispers of motion, trust it. Lucknow or London — the destination doesn’t matter; the journey does. Because every mile you travel is a karmic classroom  and astrology, when read right, is the map of your soul’s passport.\n\n\nFrom LagneshMitra’s Desk 🔯\nIf your chart shows a strong 9th-12th link or Rahu in motion and you’re wondering when your “boarding pass” activates —\ndrop your chart details in comments or DM privately for deeper insight.\n"

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nThrowaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI started my business at the end of 2022. It’s a super niche SaaS involving VoIP, entirely online, and 100% remote. What started as a random side idea has now somehow become a full-blown company. (Forgive me I use ChatGPT to help me spellcheck and write this).\n\nTo give some context:\n\n* 2022: \\~100 subscribers (website started kinda as just a test of my skills and then just snowballed)\n* 2023: 458\n* 2024: 1,000\n* 2025: Just shy of 2,000\n\nTurnover has followed that growth, **£420k last year**, and on track for around **£660k this year**. Supplier costs sit around **£265k/year**, and advertising is about **£2.5k/month**. I pay myself roughly **£85k/year** (split between salary and dividends), my only employee gets **£2.5k/month**, and my partner the same. My **corporation tax bill this year alone is £31k**. This year I even bought out a competitor (they only had 50 customers) but I was super thrilled even if they were smaller. That and getting my first ever new car gave me a temporary feeling of \"I've made it\". But it's worn off (I'm late thirties).\n\nI’ve invested around **£90k** into a team of developers to build a new web app that automates about 90% of what me and my employee currently do. It’s now fully paid off and almost ready to launch, it looks fantastic and should make the business largely self-sustaining once live. But when I first started working with the developers it didn't feel 'real' now it's nearly launched my anxiety has skyrocketed. I don't know why.\n\nBut honestly, I’m struggling. The anxiety has got so bad that I’ve been having physical chest pain for weeks. I’ve worn a heart monitor for a week (Dr got me to do it), and I’m due back in hospital next week for more heart tests. Deep down, I’m convinced it’s just the stress of it all.\n\nThe strange part is that I only *really* work about **10 days a month** (not counting the late evenings between 8pm and midnight where I tidy things up). It’s all run from home, the income’s solid, and there’s no daily chaos, yet I feel either completely at peace, or completely tense, worried something will go wrong, or that I’ve somehow just got lucky and it’ll all vanish. Like I don't deserve it. And I'm so terrified of ever having to work in an office again.\n\nI never really saw myself as a business owner or entrepreneur. My sister runs her own business too (different niche) and said she went through the same thing. We both grew up poor in the UK, so to suddenly be making good money feels… unnatural, almost like I don’t deserve it.\n\nI think part of my anxiety comes from not knowing what’s next. I’ve built something real, profitable, and simple, but I’m so mentally drained I can’t imagine doing this forever.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in a similar place, how do you deal with the constant anxiety and imposter syndrome? How do you find peace when everything looks fine on paper, but inside you’re a mess? I feel bi-polar (apologies to anyone who's actually bi-polar) but my mood is either absolute bliss, or I want to destroy the world. \n\nI’m genuinely proud of what I’ve built, but I’m exhausted. Any advice or shared experiences would really help."

Original construction circa 1875, Cincinnatus, NY (near Cortland). Property is in a very remote and rural area with lots of state forests and logging operations..so I would imagine it would be something local? Nearby forests have mostly spruce, pine, maples, red oak, eastern larch, black cherry, poplars, black locust.... Grain seems tight but some knots, and random widths..leaning towards white pine?"

It is quite short and one of my first English language creative writing practice questions I have done \n\nThe desert lay still , completely unmoving, unending expanses of golden sand under a merciless heat emanating from the sun. Each grain shimmered beneath the relentless gaze of the sun, so bright it almost seemed as if the ground itself was luminous, and mixed with the sultriness of the air, it made it almost too humid to breathe comfortably.\n\n\nA loud silence stretched across the barren dunes, so thick that all to be heard was my own heartbeat, and hearing a pin drop would be no challenge. Sparse amounts of rocks were dispersed across the sand, and rose somewhat defiantly, dark shadows clinging desperately to the edges.\n\n\nBeneath my feet, the ground radiated heat, heat so intense that it felt searing against my skin, as fire would, and the grains sifted and slid like liquid fire.\n\n\nEven with the emptiness of the vast desert that unfurled before me, the view still had a strange beauty, one that is only present in a remote place - a vast sky, unbroken by the pollution of humans, with the glow of the sun at dusk, slowly transforming from a calm azure to a warm gold to the deep indigo that only appears at night."

The initial attack vector involves spearphishing emails that deliver malicious LNK files masquerading as communications related to NATO and European Union meetings. These files leverage the high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-9491) to install the PlugX remote access trojan, allowing the attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive diplomatic communications and data.\n\nThis zero-day flaw is particularly concerning due to its method of operation, which relies on tricking users into interacting with malicious content. In recent analyses, the scope of these attacks has expanded from primarily Hungarian and Belgian diplomats to include entities across Europe, raising alarms about the risks faced by diplomatic communications. As the exploit does not currently have a patch from Microsoft, organizations are urged to take immediate steps to block malicious file types and related command-and-control infrastructure to mitigate the impact of these ongoing attacks.\n\nWhat measures do you think diplomats and organizations should take to protect against such cyber-espionage threats?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-exploit-windows-zero-day-to-spy-on-european-diplomats/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**"

    "selftext": "\n**In January 2024, a breach in Microsoft's systems by Russian hackers highlighted that passwords remain a critical vulnerability in cybersecurity.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Even advanced security measures can't fully protect against weak passwords.\n- Legacy accounts in corporate systems are significant points of vulnerability.\n- Users often utilize predictable password modifications, making their accounts easier to breach.\n- Implementing dynamic password management strategies is essential for robust security.\n- Regular audits and risk-based authentication are key to protecting sensitive access points.\n\nIn a striking revelation, Microsoft's January 2024 security breach underscored a persistent issue: despite the sophistication of current security technologies, weak passwords can still be exploited. This incident serves as a sharp reminder that organizations must prioritize password security as an essential component of their cybersecurity strategies. For many IT teams, it is alarming to realize that the humble password often remains the weakest link, one that attackers can easily breach even with multiple layers of security in place. The breach demonstrated that passwords can easily become entry points for cyber criminals, proving that no security system is infallible.\n\nToday's cybersecurity landscape is complex, with on-premises servers, cloud platforms, and remote work setups creating a multifaceted environment for password management. Legacy accounts, which often go unchecked, can function as hidden vulnerabilities, much like forgotten spare keys left under mats at old houses. These weak entry points provide attackers with easy access to networks that are assumed to be secure. Additionally, the average individual struggles to manage numerous passwords, leading them to use predictable variations that fall short of true security, effectively becoming 'master keys' for hackers. To combat these challenges, organizations need to adopt intelligent password management policies that focus on length, memorability, and dynamic strategies, such as risk-based authentication, to ensure finer control over access and mitigate the threats posed by weak passwords.\n\nWhat steps should organizations take to improve their password security in light of recent breaches?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/why-password-controls-still-matter-in-cybersecurity/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**"

As the threat landscape evolves, organizations face heightened risks, particularly those using outdated or misconfigured systems. The agencies stress the need for robust security measures such as limiting administrative access and employing multi-factor authentication to significantly improve defenses against potential exploitation.\n\nThe urgency of this guidance is underscored by recent exploits targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. CISA warns that many such instances lack the necessary protections, making them vulnerable to attacks that could compromise sensitive communications. The proactive steps outlined in the guidance focus not only on immediate security measures but also on long-term strategies, such as transitioning away from aging infrastructure towards cloud solutions like Microsoft 365 to ensure better resilience against future threats. Furthermore, companies are urged to remain vigilant, especially in light of a new vulnerability in WSUS that has already seen evidence of exploitation, affecting organizations across various sectors, including technology and healthcare.\n\nWhat actions is your organization taking to secure its servers against these emerging threats?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/cisa-and-nsa-issue-urgent-guidance-to.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**"

The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 9.3, allows hackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems, leading to severe security breaches. Reports indicate that attackers are actively exploiting this vulnerability to install backdoors on compromised systems, facilitating ongoing control over critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Tick group, also known by multiple aliases, has been operating since at least 2006 and is engaged in cyber espionage. Their recent operations have included deploying a known backdoor called Gokcpdoor, which establishes a proxy connection to execute malicious commands. Sophos has noted that these attacks utilize advanced techniques like DLL side-loading and the Havoc post-exploitation framework to further infiltrate networks and exfiltrate sensitive data. With the Tick group previously leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities, organizations using Lanscope are advised to promptly assess their security posture and make necessary upgrades to prevent such intrusions.\n\nWhat steps are you taking to secure your corporate systems against such vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/china-linked-tick-group-exploits.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**"

Now they’re saying I’m “past the 180-day appeal window” and they “don’t have the right tools” to fix it.\n\nIt’s been two months of going in circles with Meta support, and every single reply comes from a different person just copy-pasting the same response. I’m a remote social media manager, and this is literally preventing me from doing my job. The business owner is hands-off, so I’m the one who needs to manage ads, and Meta basically refuses to look deeper into their own mistake.\n\nI’m honestly at my wits’ end and about to file a formal complaint with the Attorney General’s office since Meta won’t take accountability.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this — being falsely restricted or told you violated an ad policy when you didn’t? Did you ever get it resolved? Any advice or hope is appreciated!"

    "selftext": "**A Little History**\n\nFor those interested in these things, One&Only Palmilla has a genuinely fascinating backstory, and it's really the story of luxury tourism in Los Cabos itself.\n\nLos Cabos as a tourist destination is surprisingly young. In 1951, when the first guesthouse opened in San José del Cabo, the town had a population of just a few thousand, while Cabo San Lucas had only 300 residents. Tourism was exceedingly modest and small-scale. Most early hotels had no more than two dozen rooms, and getting to Southern Baja required flying in supplies, equipment, and even manpower from the Mexican mainland. It wasn't until the Transpeninsular Highway was completed in 1973 and Los Cabos International Airport opened in 1977 that the region became accessible for large-scale tourism. Even then, the airport couldn't handle wide-body jets until a major expansion in 1992.\n\nThe property now known as One&Only Palmilla was one of the pioneers that started it all. Originally built in 1956 by Abelardo \"Rod\" Rodríguez Jr., the son of a former Mexican president, and his wife Lucille Bremer, a former actress who had shared screen time with Fred Astaire, it was called Hotel Las Cruces Palmilla. It opened on a beach where cattle were still being loaded onto offshore ships. The hotel had just 15 rooms.\n\nWhen Conrad Hilton visited as a guest, he reportedly quipped to local hotel pioneer Luis Cóppola: \"For Christ's sake, that's a boarding house, not a hotel!\" But despite its modest size, Palmilla attracted a celebrity-rich clientele from the start: Hollywood royalty, heads of state, and those who valued discretion above all else. In its early years, it was accessible only by boat or small plane. There were no roads, no major airport. It was a true escape.\n\nThe resort changed hands over the decades. An American developer eventually bought the property and brought Jack Nicklaus to Los Cabos to design two signature golf courses, including Palmilla. When One&Only took over management in 2004, they expanded the room inventory, added a 25,000-square-foot spa, and brought the first celebrity chef (Charlie Trotter, RIP) to Los Cabos.\n\nWhat makes Palmilla historically significant isn't just its Hollywood past, it's that it was one of the first luxury resorts in all of Baja California, opening decades before the major hospitality brands arrived. Long before Las Ventanas opened in the 1990s and properties like Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton arrived in the 2000s and beyond, Palmilla set the tone for what Los Cabos could be: a private sanctuary for those seeking natural beauty and world-class hospitality in a place that felt genuinely remote.\n\nThis isn't a resort that's trying to be all things to all people. Instead it embraces its position as a private, deeply rooted sanctuary that prioritizes warmth, privacy, and genuine hospitality over flash. And that identity, rooted in its history as Los Cabos' original luxury hideaway, remains intact today.\n\n[Wonderful little secret gardens are all around the property ](https://preview.redd.it/mm9yjznz4hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f64bcbe7597bada303ee17fb34163e571f41a3a)\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nThe arrival experience set the tone. As we pulled up, a local shaman greeted us with copal smoke, a traditional Mayan blessing meant to cleanse and welcome. It's the kind of gesture that could feel woo-woo, but it didn't. It felt intentional and grounding, like the property was saying: you're not just checking into a hotel, you're entering a space that respects this place and its traditions.\n\nThe architecture is traditional hacienda style: whitewashed walls, terracotta tiles, hand-painted Talavera details, and lush, overgrown landscaping that gives the whole property a jungle-like privacy. There are 174 keys total, including two four-bedroom villas, and the scale never feels overwhelming.\n\nIs everything brand new and cutting-edge? No. The aesthetic is more timeless than trendy, and some finishes show their age. But everything is immaculately maintained. If you need the latest in contemporary design, this probably isn't your place. If you want charm, character, and a sense of history, you'll love it here. I know some of you fellow redditors do not have high opinions of my photography and I will admit - the photos here don't do this resort justice - it's definitely the kind of place you have to experience yourself to see why it's magical.\n\n[There were a few demons left but overall, welcome gets 10\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/ucyy6hc45hyf1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=9033c70343455e12b10331353973c2d68be251a9)\n\n**Service: The Real Star**\n\nThe service here is some of the best I've experienced anywhere.\n\nThere are over 1,000 staff members for 174 rooms. You feel it immediately. Every staff member we passed greeted us with their hand over their heart which is a small gesture that, over the course of a week, became deeply moving. It wasn't performative. It felt like genuine care, and my kids noticed it too.\n\nWe were assigned a butler, and I'll admit I was skeptical. I've had \"butlers\" at other resorts who you never see again after check-in. Not here. Our butler checked in daily, helped coordinate our dining plans every evening, and brought my kids coloring books after realizing I was traveling alone with 3 kids I needed a little extra distraction for my feral animals at dinner time. When we had an unexpected power outage (more on that in a moment), he helped us pack up our entire room, kept my kids entertained during the move, and made what could have been a stressful situation feel completely manageable.\n\nThat level of attentiveness extended to every interaction. At breakfast, staff remembered my kids' egg orders. At dinner, they went out of their way to accommodate my extremely picky eater with custom off-menu dishes that she would actually eat. They quickly figured out my deep love of churros.\n\n[My son wants me to tell everyone they have a garden full of hammocks hidden here too](https://preview.redd.it/xyd3b6z67hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d0a1afc3c9948808aea99c34c1a3049a27e89f0)\n\n**The Power Outage (And How They Handled It)**\n\nMidway through our stay, we had an electrical outage in our building. I expressed some concern to my butler about what I was going to do if we had no power at bedtime- within minutes, our butler was at the door with a plan. They proactively moved us to a building with full power, helped  pack up, manage my feral 4 year old son who didn't have a shirt or shoes on for the entire interaction, and transport everything, and had our new room completely set up before we even arrived. By the time we got there, the kids' stuffed animals were arranged on the beds, the bags were unpacked, and everything felt seamless.\n\nThe power in our original room came back on a few hours later, but I was grateful they didn't wait to see if it would. They anticipated the problem and solved it before it became one. That's the kind of service that makes you a repeat guest.\n\n**Rooms**\n\nWe stayed in two different room categories: a Casita Junior Suite, oceanfront and an Oceanfront double queen.  The rooms were both spacious, traditionally decorated, and had traditional hacienda-style warmth: wooden beams, tile floors, and doors that opened directly onto a private terrace; there are no bad views here.\n\nThe rooms themselves had the essentials - blackout curtains, excellent air conditioning, and really comfortable beds. The bathroom was large, well-lit, and stocked with high-quality products. Everything worked. Everything was clean. \n\nHousekeeping was flawless. Turndown service included thoughtful touches like arranging the kids' toys and leaving small treats. Everything felt intentional and personal.\n\n[Characterful bathrooms - my children were sad they looked out on the ocean so they couldn't moon anyone](https://preview.redd.it/aokp8b9m5hyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=980de85d4ab0ac5c3510ef32acf0b8ded137acfd)\n\n[I told you guys these rooms are not the epitome of contemporary glam - so Reddit haters don't @ me. You could, however, eat off the floors \\(before my kids stomped through them\\) - they are that clean. Zero dust anywhere.](https://preview.redd.it/3hduvc9m5hyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c929f8a0bc770d9aa8a63b04fb1b98aae16af270)\n\n[Old School Hacienda Style decor](https://preview.redd.it/8sorfd9m5hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d92bccc10b639788d7ab63acff94c69a276e9fd)\n\n**The Beach**\n\nThis is where Palmilla truly stands out. The beach is one of the few genuinely swimmable beaches along the Cabo Corridor. The water is calm, clear, and protected — perfect for families with young children. My kids spent hours playing in the gentle waves, and I actually felt relaxed watching them rather than constantly worried about undertow.\n\nThe beach was never crowded. There are plenty of comfortable loungers, and attentive staff.\n\nFor water activities, the resort offers complimentary kayaking, paddleboarding, and snorkeling equipment. \n\n[we had the beach to ourselves most days](https://preview.redd.it/3osafpph5hyf1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee34095a52723c12f7d1c0a263bdf2d4a44980e)\n\n**Kids' Club**\n\nThe kids' club was legitimately excellent. My children are at the age where they can be brutally honest about whether they're having fun (usually they fight me on going and are happy to leave), and they loved it. The activities were varied, thoughtful, and well-supervised. The staff was warm and engaging, and my kids asked to go back every single day.\n\nThe club is currently in a temporary space while they build a new, expanded location that will double the size. It's scheduled to be finished before Thanksgiving, which is great timing for families planning winter trips.\n\nWhat impressed me most was how the staff remembered details about each child, their interests, their preferences, what they'd enjoyed the day before. Parents are not supposed to hang out but I lingered a little bit in the hallway and heard them dealing with my son who was being kind of an a-hole about some perceived slight in a jump rope game, and I was really impressed with how quickly they got him to turn it around (he still legitimately sucks at jumprope, however - they're not miracle workers after all). It felt personal and genuinely caring, not just babysitting.\n\n**Food**\n\nWe ate at several of the resort's restaurants, and the quality was consistently excellent. My favorite was Seared, the steakhouse. The food was outstanding, and the service was just awesome. They went above and beyond to accommodate my picky eater, creating custom dishes that weren't on the menu and presenting them beautifully. My one mild critique is that the food here is expensive. If you are going expecting cheap tacos, this is not your jam.\n\nEvery morning, we stopped by La Casa de Abuela, a charming little spot that serves coffee in the morning and refreshments in the afternoon. My kids went ham on the juices. The mexican coffee was top notch.\n\nFor breakfast the buffet is presented beautifully and my kids loved the magical pastry cabinet.\n\n[Magic](https://preview.redd.it/b25b89wa6hyf1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9e22d9e6bf633069023e72a836871ffc5a47863)\n\n**Spa & Wellness**\n\nThe One&Only Spa is exceptional. It has 13 treatment rooms, all designed to accommodate couples, and the atmosphere is serene and deeply spiritual. The highlight for me was the temazcal (sweat lodge), which is guided by a shaman. The temazcal is a traditional Mayan purification ceremony, and the experience is meant to represent the womb: you enter in darkness, sit in intense heat, and emerge feeling reborn. It's not for everyone, but if you're open to it, it's powerful.\n\nThe entire spa feels less like a hotel amenity and more like a true wellness sanctuary. Everything about it, from the design to the treatments to the rituals, is rooted in the culture and Mexican traditions.\n\nThe gym was well-equipped and had natural light, which I appreciated. It's not massive, but it has everything you need for a solid workout.\n\n[Entrance to Spa](https://preview.redd.it/yy4kc73d6hyf1.jpg?width=4167&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c19eab401a3f71095d9abdd03d84427160e889)\n\n[Temazcal](https://preview.redd.it/5qecd93d6hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b230fffa4ec59df2f557c6741e1151e5c5adb54)\n\n**Other Amenities**\n\nThe resort has a 27-hole golf course (18 holes private, 9 public), two tennis courts, two pickleball courts, and a new arcade that opens after 11 a.m. There's also a new social club, and the resort continues to add thoughtful amenities without losing its intimate feel.\n\nThe landscaping is lush, private, and gives the property a true jungle-meets-ocean vibe. You feel completely removed from the rest of Cabo, which is exactly the point.\n\nThere's also a chapel on the property, built in 1957, which is still used for weddings and private services. It's a beautiful piece of the resort's history and adds to the sense of place.\n\n[Really dreamy kid pool - also they have kid sized loungers that are truly the cutest and my kids loved them](https://preview.redd.it/v6kvjsvi6hyf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=282fa17c754abd1ead4b40eb6558fc2eec413919)\n\n[Adult pool. I didn't use it but I stared at it longingly at breakfast](https://preview.redd.it/maw91l7c7hyf1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=204b6e1cef574d6bdd7ee28ec0027f0b609d44e9)\n\n**Final Takeaways**\n\nOne&Only Palmilla is not the flashiest or the newest. Instead it distinguishes itself through thoughtful, rooted, and genuinely excellent hospitality. \n\nThe service is some of the best I've experienced. The property is private, beautiful, and immaculately maintained. The food is excellent, the kids' club is top-tier, and the whole place feels like it genuinely cares about your experience.\n\nI met and saw several ultra-high-net-worth guests during our stay, and it was clear why they chose Palmilla: discretion, privacy, and service that anticipates rather than reacts.\n\nThis is a place that earns its reputation every single day.\n\n**Who This Resort Is For**\n\nFamilies who want genuinely excellent kids' programming and attentive service\n\nTravelers who value privacy, discretion, and a sense of place\n\nGuests who appreciate traditional Mexican hacienda style and cultural authenticity\n\nAnyone who wants one of the few truly swimmable beaches in the area\n\nRepeat Cabo visitors who want something quieter and more rooted than the party scene\n\nAnyone who wants to feel genuinely cared for\n\n**Who This Resort Is Not For**\n\nTravelers who need the newest, most contemporary design\n\nParty-seekers looking for a buzzy scene or nightlife\n\nGuests who want to be in the center of Cabo's restaurant and bar scene\n\nAnyone who prioritizes modern aesthetics over charm and character\n\nBudget-conscious travelers (this is a premium property with premium pricing)"

Task Manager > find exe > right click open file location > C:\\\\\\\\\\DattoAV folder. \n\nHopped on Copilot to find Datto does in fact utilize Avira engine. My guess is because of all the AWS and Azure issues, maybe redirected/pointed to this new Google-hosted site to keep AV up and running? Hopefully.\n\nTL;DR found out Datto uses Avira through brief moments of panic that we're infected/hacked, blocked it all only to find is legit. \n\nNot much else online about this so hopefully could help someone else? Certainly ate up my morning thinking I was about to have a long day/weekend!"

He finds clipped news articles about Katherine Latchford (but none about the other 3 Trawler victims). He pockets a spare key to Mallory’s penthouse and heads to the basement where he finds stocks of pet food and a locked door. Upon leaving, he spots the beige-colored van again and scrapes his knee trying to chase it down. That night, he passes out on Valium and receives six silent voicemails.\n\nOn a late school night, Bret receives an emergency call from Terry in the hospital asking him to go to the Windover Stables and act as a witness/surrogate to a crime scene involving Debbie’s prize horse Spirit. Bret arrives to a grotesque scene: Spirit has been disemboweled and mutilated just like Alex, Matt Kellner’s cat. Bret reports this back to Terry who urges him not to tell Debbie. The stables are quickly bleached and cleaned and Debbie is told that Spirit died of a heart abnormality, which sends her into shock. She doesn’t show up to school.\n\nThom returns to Buckley. Bret tells him about Susan and Robert’s Palm Springs weekend excursion while he was away. Tension grows throughout the week, finally erupting at lunch on Thursday. Thom painfully confronts Robert. He and Susan break up.\n\nThat Thursday night, Debbie’s golden retriever disappears and during a nighttime swim in the pool, someone tries to grab her leg and drown her. In a panic, Debbie contacts the police and calls Susan to tell her she is coming over to spend the night. But Debbie never makes it to Susan’s house. Before Debbie leaves, she finds a manila envelope from Liz containing explicit photos of her father and Bret at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Angry and hysterical, Debbie calls Bret and screams at him. The next morning, her BMW is gone. She vanishes.\n\nBret drowns himself in Quaaludes. Bret’s dog Shingy disappears and he finds Matt Kellner’s jockey shorts and the Maxell tape neatly laid out on his bed (which the housekeeper confirms wasn’t her doing). Increasingly paranoid that he is the next Trawler victim, he barricades the house. Over the weekend, Robert Mallory shows up to Bret’s house. Robert confronts Bret about breaking into his Benedict Canyon home and again denies Bret’s accusations about his connection to Matt Kellner’s death. Robert fake seduces Bret before calling him a  🚬🐐 and leaving.\n\nEverything comes to a violent end Saturday night. Susan is attacked and slashed in a home invasion. Thom comes to rescue her but is also severely injured. Susan bites down on the intruder’s forearm and he flees. Robert Mallory arrives soon after and rushes Susan and Thom to the hospital. Susan’s mom calls Bret to warn him that they are possibly being targeted. Immediately suspecting Robert, Bret races to Century City using his spare key to sneak in to Robert’s penthouse. Bret disables the door, unplugs the phone lines, and grabs a kitchen knife. Robert catches Bret off guard, defensively wielding a butcher knife. Bret accuses Robert of kidnapping Debbie. Robert accuses Bret of being “one of the freaks” following him since the death of Kathy Latchford. It escalates into a blood-drenched knife fight, ending on the balcony where Robert Mallory falls 27 stories to his death.\n\nUnable to tell the truth, Bret spins an exaggerated narrative about Robert’s mental illness and death. Debbie returns home, revealing she had spent a no-contact weekend with her secret fling, a 30 year old musician in the Hollywood Hills. Bret visits Susan in recovery but the visit is cut short when Susan sees a deep wound on Bret’s forearm and thinks it is the bite mark she left on the intruder. Late November, the Trawler abducts another girl and verifies that Robert Mallory was simply “the God” he sacrificed the girls to, but was not involved in the crimes. Abby Mallory releases letters proving that Robert was indeed stalked by the Trawler. Bret’s narrative falls apart.\n\nBret becomes a pariah the rest of senior year. Susan and Thom leave Buckley and finish school elsewhere. Bret doesn’t see Thom again until 1999 at a book signing and Susan until 2019—the incident at the beginning of the book which triggered his anxiety and forced him to write The Shards. He doesn’t contact Debbie in 1992 when her father passes away. He learns from fellow classmate Tracy Goldman in 2018 that Ryan Vaughn settled in San Francisco with his partner.\n\n# Podcast Recap + Interesting Tidbits\n\n**Episode 26** contains the first (and only) major scene/plot difference between the podcast and the book. In the book, Thom never showed up to school after his breakup with Susan. In the podcast, Thom shows up to school late after morning assembly and physically attacks Robert in the courtyard. Ryan, Jeff, and the coach break up the fight and Thom is suspended and escorted off campus.\n\n**In the final episode**, Bret says *The Shards* is his first book not overly concerned with style or artifice, just pure narrative. And while he started the narrative with the goal of unravelling the mystery of the Trawler, ultimately *The Shards* became about the people he loved: Matt Kellner, Susan Reynolds, Thom Wright, Ryan Vaughn.\n\n[A Daily News article posted on the BEEPodcast sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/BEEPodcast/comments/mvz210/debbie_schaffer_attended_one_of_brets_nyc_parties/) (found by u/Real-Base466), reveals the real Debbie Schaffer attended Bret’s loft party in December 1990.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nDespite Bret Easton Ellis’ assertion, *The Shards* isn’t a simple retelling of true events. Too many discrepancies, small and large:\n\n* In podcast Episode 3, the photo taken by Terry’s assistant Steven Reinhardt isn’t mentioned (he just hesitates and waves). It is added retroactively.\n* Decor/menu/celebrity details from Bret’s meeting with Terry at Trumps restaurant is pulled from an LA Times article, not Bret’s memory.\n* All-too-simple narrative convenience of Bret’s meeting and conversation with Abby Mallory that only serves to reinforce every detail of Bret’s own narrative but makes little sense from Abby’s perspective.\n* Thom attacks Robert after his breakup with Susan in the podcast retelling, but not in the book.\n* Bret’s credibility is never reexamined by police/investigators even though he widely spreads a false narrative among his classmates.\n* Bret kept in touch with Debbie Schaffer irl, but chose to omit this from the epilogue, despite highlighting his reunion with Thom.\n* An incident as dramatic as Robert Mallory’s death would have followed the author of a book like *American Psycho*.\n\nIt might be a cop-out on my part, but instead of attempting to unravel *The Shards* like a True Crime mystery (Was the bite mark real? Did Bret do it?), I’m inclined to treat it like pure symbolic fiction. Bret, the character, is obsessed in a meta-sense with “narratives,” the “pantomime,” being the “tangible participant” in his own story. I get the sense that BEE, the author, wrote and narrated *The Shards* 40 years later as catharsis for unaddressed emotions and regrets. His relationships with Matt, Ryan, Thom, Susan, Debbie were all real. The undergirding emotions were real too. Robert Mallory, in the end, was just some unattainable guy that Bret used in his narrative, his version of events, as a psychological scapegoat for his sexual frustrations and repressed self. When Bret’s double life is finally exposed and his friend group has a massive falling out, Robert Mallory ‘dies.’ As Robert says: *When you talk to me you're really talking to yourself, dude.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*The Shards* was my first BEE novel. ngl, its length daunted me at first but its prose wasn’t remotely dense or plot as tedious as 600+ page novels tend to be, thankfully. I also finally read *American Psycho* this month. BEE’s insatiable horniness and his ability to capture the bygone glamour and artifice of “Empire” era America make for a highly engaging read. Prominent music references give his novels a movie-script-like feel. At certain times, BEE is directing scenes with the soundtrack already picked out. Name-dropping albums, songs, and artists in a novel can establish the right mood, evoke nostalgia, transport you to an era, etc, but it rarely works for me personally, even if I share the same music taste as the author. I think it works far better on screen (Quentin Tarantino being an obvious example). *Less Than Zero* seems short, so I’ll probably read it next weekend when I have time.\n\nIf, by some rare chance, anyone is still following along, I’d love to read your thoughts. Do any of you think *The Shards* is 99% true like Bret claims?\n\n# Upcoming Book Discussions\n\n**November 1 - 30**: The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst\n\n**December 1 - 31**: [INVERSION, Gay Life After the Homosexual](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOEPlUHiGMr/)"

Then rainmeter mond and discord that’s pretty much it, and after the setup I had 380-90 GB Left Of space out of 475, 50 gb and majority of the space went to system files which is a bummer. Okay so yeah I had 380-390GB+ left then on the following days I just watched a few movies on my laptop (on my browser) and played valo. Never downloaded anything new, slowly I noticed my 390 went down to 375 when night came. I didn’t think much of it then I set it to sleep, and used it the next day and played valo and noticed it went to 369 while playing when I closed it, it went up to 371 I still lost 4GB? Then Day over I watched a few movies closed it to sleep, the next day which was today, I played on it like usual then I so happen to my storage drop from 371 to a whopping 359 what’s happening?

I arrived at a comfortable point where I lead a small department of amazing people and really enjoy working with them. I often work remote which allows me a lot of flexibility :)\n\nPhysical: I am 185cm tall with a healthy weight/height proportion. I am trying to stay active at the gym and I am definitely loving it! I have my right arm including peck tattood and generally love tattoos, so if you have them I would gladly want to know more about them and see them! Looks wise I used to gravitate towards more of a metalhead look but I recently trimmed my beard short and cut my shoulder-length hair, I have blue eyes, ear piercing, dressed mostly in comfy hoodies (I can promise you can wear one of them) and darker clothes.  \nPreview: [https://imgur.com/a/SxAkXcd](https://imgur.com/a/SxAkXcd)\n\nPersonality wise I would say I am pretty chill, I don't like drama or stress outside of my workplace so I am usually quite mellow and relaxed. I try my best to communicate openly and am quite in touch with my state of mind and emotions. I joke around a lot (be prepared for a lot of dad jokes) and sarcasm is one of my favourite languages. I laugh a lot and try to make other people laugh too, it's one of the joys I've learned.\n\nHobbies are gravitating more towards nerdy shit, Warhammer 40k, PC Games, Genshin, Honkai, MMOs (WoW, XIV, would love someone to try GW2 or Lost Ark with), reading (got my first 40k book recently which I am excited about), music, concerts and festivals. Just came back from Tuska in Finland and my next stop is a concert in Vienna. I would like to go to the Oslo Rock festival next year and possibly Graspop or Novarock. Tattooing (I would like to get another piece done on my left leg) and in general body art. My focus for this year is physical and mental health so I would like to learn how to play the guitar and have gotten into a healthy workout schedule. I am also currently very much obsessed with Bikes! Definitely something I intend to persuit next year and get my drivers license in!\n\nWhat I am looking for:\n\nSomeone to build a strong, honest and healthy relationship with. I want us to be there for each other, care about each other but also to joke, laugh, have fun, explore the world, explore music and really fall in love. I am looking for someone who has their own life in order but is missing that \"someone\" to fill that open spot, maybe to sink their passion and heart into?\n\nThings which are important: I do not want children (apart from furry children, doggos and cats are adorable), I am not religious and prefer you not to be either. I am also not a big fan of drugs, partying and substance abuse. Also please be within Europe, I am not interested to date outside of the EU.\n\nHope to hear from you soon :)"

All in all, it seems fairly liquidy, but I am unsure what else to do. \n\nDoes anyone recognise the make of septic tank, or can provide me a diagram of what I'm looking at? I only have found the one lid to see inside, and I have seen a handwritten \"1000l\" written on the top, so it's fairly small. I've put a hose pipe from the crack most of the way down the pipe and not found any blockages there, which makes me think the blockage must be near the septic tank. But I'm unsure how to unblock it from that end? There is a PVC pipe that goes directly down into the tank, meaning I cannot angle a hosepipe or anything else up it from above. I've tried digging the pipe out from outside of the tank, but it appears super stuck on and won't undo. Any advice for next steps would be much appreciated!\n\n"

Make a post listing all your hobbies and try to connect through them? Bond while playing video games? Share the same k\\\\\\*nks? Have casual conversations and start as friends? This time, I'll try an approach I've never tried before: I'll describe what my ideal life(-style) looks like and if you see yourself sharing that vision...jackpot. I think the chance of someone reading this who shares the same weird ideas is extremely low, but so is finding your soulmate any other way so here we go...\n\n\\* I work completely remote in IT and I love to travel/explore/adventure. You could call it digital nomad, but I have a steady apartment, of course. Traveling 6 months per year and 6 months at home is a nice balance for me, but not set in stone in either direction.\n\n\\* My traveling style is pretty active (with some cosy rest days sprinkled in). When I'm not working, I like to spend as little time inside as possible. I like hiking, cities, nature, restaurants, quiet bars, (classical) concerts, cinemas, museums, anything from the most touristy spots to remote areas. I definitely prefer warm climates, but I'm not a spend your entire day laying at the beach type of person, though \"long walks at the beach\" might just be my favourite thing.\n\n\\* I'm a hopeless romantic and always wanted my partner to be my best friend. An us against the world type of thing (sound unhealthy? Maybe, but then again, what isn't nowadays). If you're clingy, want to share most of your time and interests with your partner - like just sitting in the same room while we do our own thing - that's my vibe. Good and bad times!\n\n\\* I lead, you follow. You need me, but you're also completely fine on your own. Paradoxical? I know.\n\n\\* Like deep, intellectual conversations about the meaning of life, psychology, science, ... (deeptalks...as they say) to completely silly nonsense like would you still love me if I was a worm? (it's important!)\n\n\\* I'm not a gym bro but workout 5-6 times a week, like to cook and watch my nutrition (bulking/cutting). I try as much as possible to keep this up while traveling, though it's very difficult.  It would be amazing to have someone to share this with and motivate each other. Your BMI should be normal, but lower is better.\n\n\\* My hobbies are the classic nerdy wombo combo: HUGE film and TV show enthusiast (not going to use the word cinephile, that always makes me cringe) - being able to watch a film and then analyse it together afterwards is a must - who's your favourite director?; horror fan!; Disney! (duh); video games - I always have my Switch with me - let's build one of those cheesy gamer couple setups together, I already have the LED strips; photography; manga; - you don't have to be into all of these, but the basic direction should be there. I'm also very interested in your interests, trying them out and maybe picking them up (learning the piano? a language?)\n\n\\* Single, never m\\\\\\*rried, no kids, monogamous, no smoking, omnivore!\n\n\\* Oh and scented candles!\n\n\\* Age: 18-27\n\nThere you have it.

    "selftext": "T: Is Hell truly a place that exists to punish human sins? This time, let’s go deeper into a special zone of Heaven: Hell. Is Hell really where human sins are punished? What I’ve seen is nothing like that.\n\n\n\nT: Over the years, several elders and friends around me have passed away. It may sound irreverent to speak of the departed this way, but I’ve spoken with their souls and thank them for allowing me to share what I discovered through their experiences. From the perspective of the deceased, my own observations and recollections, and group discussions, I’ve summarized these insights:\n\n\n\nT: A soul is not a single unit; it’s a cluster of light—dense in some places, diffuse in others—much like a comet’s state.\n\n\n\nT: At the instant the body exhales its last breath, the senses of the mind-soul yearn to see someone again, to say goodbye. Awareness expands without limit. Like water suddenly spilling from a bowl and losing its fixed form, it can be here and there at once, spanning many dimensions. It can even appear beside tens of thousands of people one knew in this life. The subtlety and vastness of the soul defy imagination.\n\n\n\nT: At such times, people with high sensitivity or spiritual sight often sense, “So-and-so has passed, and they came to see me.” These shards of awareness feel like passing thoughts—light as air—faint, misty emotions, an oddly fresh atmosphere (hard to describe). They rarely cause fear because their energy is scattered and drifting. Sometimes they only think of seeing you again yet can’t even recall their own name.\n\n\n\nT: Meanwhile, residual awareness within the body still retains much of the ego. Even after the organs stop, one may hear, or seem to see loved ones with the mind’s eye. One can even feel the radiant energy fields of those loved ones and experience selfless love and the stillness of the spirit world.\n\n\n\nT: At this stage, the original spirit is blending with awareness, lifted upward by guardian souls to rest.\n\n\n\nT: But the frequency of the primordial soul is so light that awareness cannot immediately perceive it—or the guardian’s presence. As awareness suddenly widens and is overwhelmed by floods of emotion, the soul rises like a comet while its heavier, fragmented pieces fall away. These fragments carry intense feelings: reluctance to part with loved ones, resentment over debts, the desire to meet people again…\n\n\n\nT: The first three days after death are the busiest for the original soul: settling the karmic accounts of this life (resolved or added), sorting the denser layers of the energy field (choosing human-world entanglements, ranking them by importance to address next life), possibly splitting a portion off to guide surviving family members, and deciding whether to reincarnate soon or rest in the spirit world for a time.\n\n\n\nT: The guardian’s main goal is to anchor the soul’s core safely in Heaven, where it can rest. If awareness stabilizes, it can follow quickly. Scattered shards of awareness and emotion are gradually gathered by heavenly messengers (appearing in many religious forms). Usually after several days—often around the seventh day—these fragments knit back together, and only then does awareness fully realize: “I’m dead!” (A shock, followed by resignation, finally allowing reunion with the original soul in Heaven.)\n\n\n\nT: Throughout this process, the high-frequency energy of the primordial soul clashes with the narrow self-identity of awareness. Most of awareness remains submerged in grief or anger, curling like a fetus in the womb (with life events vividly fast-forwarding). The primordial soul does not force this; after all, they are one and the same. When the turmoil settles, the re-merging completes.\n\n\n\nT: In any case, these drifting fragments are simply the soul’s emotional aspects. Because of free will, no deity—however mighty—can force a reincarnation.\n\n\n\nT: Thus, emotions and attachments separated from the primordial spirit can cling to others, becoming karmic creditors. And yes, we can also become karmic creditors to others.\n\n\n\nT: (When one begins cultivating kindness and helping others, even karmic creditors can see this and reflect. Hence the saying: “Cultivate the self to ferry all beings.” As you elevate yourself, you also elevate those who once hated you, letting them glimpse a better world—and they willingly depart.)\n\n\n\nT: Because a soul can fragment without limit, excessive dispersion weakens it. The gravity of karma then pulls us back together—to meet again, to understand, to clash or reconcile, to repay debts and retrieve our lost pieces—so the light can become whole once more.\n\n\n\nT: This differs entirely from the notion of Hell.\n\n\n\nT: When people die, they reunite with their primordial soul. From that higher vantage, they see through the absurdities and falsehoods of worldly life, feel guilt and prickings of conscience. This generates the illusion of Hell. Out of indebtedness, awareness is willing to accept punishment as a way to lighten the burden.\n\n\n\nT: Those who suffer in Hell are the fragments of awareness—not the primordial spirit.\n\n\n\nT: Structurally within Heaven, each culture has its own Hell-forms. Whether S, Y, or any other culture, all are organs within Earth’s karmic management system. Messengers of karma exist above and below; the underground divisions are larger in scale. Those who work there shine with white light, but because the work is strict, entry is restricted—only specialists may enter to review.\n\n\n\nM: “I occasionally go to observe, discussing with G about planetary blueprints and events that must be planned to prevent excessive energetic stagnation. In a sense, I’m their superior. Of course, ordinary souls coming to Earth to reincarnate cannot enter; administrators and visitors operate on entirely different tiers.”\n\n\n\nT: Our souls come to help Earth process karma, but the karma is so heavy that it can only be absorbed into Earth’s energy meridians.\n\n\n\nT: Before reincarnating, a soul registers with the Reincarnation Planning Board (RPB), drafts a life blueprint that accounts for karmic debts, and generates a conscious child-self. A bespoke embryo forms in Earth’s womb, spending ten months downloading the appropriate karmic energies and context. During this period, embryo and awareness co-vibrate, allowing the soul’s high frequency to gradually descend and adapt to Earth’s atmosphere.\n\n\n\nT: Ten months later, the child is born. Earth’s meridians guide bodily development through karma, leading to experiences until life ends. When life ends, the primordial soul returns to Heaven to complete its report and reintegrate, while the karma stored in the body returns to Earth’s meridians.\n\n\n\nT: In short, when souls rest in Heaven, they need not carry karma. Only, if the contract’s term isn’t complete or the trial isn’t passed, they cannot graduate and depart Earth. Karma circulates on and within Earth, monitored and recorded by the Earth Planning Dept (EPD), much like a stock market where trades occur remotely—but only by entering this world do they receive and process karma in concrete form.\n\n\n\nT: Thus, when souls return to Heaven to rest (Earth Reincarnation Rest Area, ERRA), they can shed all emotional distortions caused by karma and regain the clarity they had upon first coming to Earth. They ask themselves whether they underestimated Earth’s lessons, overlooked personal blind spots, whether they should explore other fields of study next life, or attend sessions with the Council of Elders (CE). Some even request leave to study on other planets, gaining new insight before returning to Earth. It’s like a magnificent university library where individuals or groups delve in quiet exploration of wisdom and knowledge.\n\n\n\nT: Heavy karma can affect Earth’s core pressure, thereby adjusting the planet’s rotational speed (explaining shifting senses of time across history and the balance of dimensions).\n\n\n\nT: The Red Dragon (RD), manager of karma, can carry negative energy out to the outer core, but its capacity is limited. The emotional energy of beings in the material world is so dense that it must manifest as tangible issues to be addressed—leading to wars and waves of refugees. Refugees carry their homeland’s karma to new nations and continents, allowing more advanced civilizations with greater resources to help resolve karmic burdens/wars. In itself, this is a soul agreement, a method arranged to aid Earth’s energy circulation.\n\n\n\nT: The Karma Division of the Earth Planning Zone (EPZ) extends to the outer core. The planning team gathers fields of illusion in the lower mantle, keeping them tightly controlled so the self-torment atmosphere doesn’t spill out.\n\n\n\nT: Hell isn’t only the self-punishment of the dead. Many, while alive, endure condemnation by conscience through forced work or actions. Part of their awareness feels deep guilt, creating Hell—or even unconsciously opening themselves to torment by souls. It’s a way of repaying karma, but an extreme one.\n\n\n\nT: Even our hatred of someone can make them “go to hell.” In truth, it just traps us. Hatred binds our awareness to another, waiting for revenge. But “fixation” is attachment. Hating someone ties us to them, never letting go, always seething—essentially building a personal hell-prison.\n\n\n\nT: Some psychics see scenes of torture in Hell because they believe in its illusion and thus naturally enter that collective world, witnessing all manner of suffering. For those who don’t believe, Hell looks like watching people in a 4D theater scream at the screen. In the spirit world, subjective belief shapes experience.\n\n\n\nT: In short: those who hold the concept of Heaven and Hell will manifest Heaven-and-Hell phenomena. In the spirit world, thought becomes reality. When a group of souls shares a concept, they generate deities and a common society, self-governed within a system. If the scale is large enough, it connects with natural cycles (karma and reincarnation). Different cultures generate Heaven/Hell ecosystems that fit their beliefs. This is why, before traveling abroad, people often pray to foreign gods for protection—it truly helps, in a spiritual-diplomatic sense.\n\n\n\nT: (From nature’s viewpoint, Earth’s energy meridians, climate, and ocean currents are parts of one system, not ruled regionally. Only the minds of humans—or of elements and beings in other dimensions—create separate autonomous zones. But mental energy is finite. No single individual can dominate Earth, especially with so many religions existing. Respecting differences is how balance is maintained. With many options, every need can be met, and each soul can choose the destiny it wishes to experience.)\n\n\n\nT: When awareness has experienced enough—whether judgment or self-satisfaction—it naturally leaves that realm and reunites with the primordial soul. Therefore, after death, experience continues unless awareness at death is calm and serene. In that case, it simply merges with the original soul without these human-made processes.\n\n\n\nT: When people live unhappily and rip themselves apart—parts of awareness denying one another—it is agonizing for helpers to witness. They can’t knit us back together; we must do it ourselves. This is why many are led onto the spiritual path: to make themselves whole again.\n\n\n\nT: We must reconcile with the denied, fragmented selves. The lighter forms resemble the Inner Child; the heavier ones may resemble karmic creditors who attack us. I (X) have met both, but thankfully they always appear within my capacity to handle.\n\n\n\nT: This process is never pleasant. We must face aspects of ourselves we fear to admit. For example, I’ve had to face that in past lives I led armies that slaughtered nations; I was once a man who raped women out of lust; I was a thief, a bandit; I killed children; I committed countless crimes in fury. Facing those dark lives and my shame, my team keeps guiding me:\n\n\n\nT: “Stop judging yourself. The past was governed by past causes. Reach for a higher vision.”\n\n\n\nT: Through such experiences, I understand both the victim’s and the perpetrator’s view, seeing human good and evil from every angle—the knots that steer history’s flow, great and small. By role-playing with each soul I love, exchanging perspectives, I dig deeper to the root and find solutions.\n\n\n\nT: At this level, good and evil, right and wrong are merely scripts in a role-playing game, not absolute definitions.\n\n\n\nT: Previously, on FB, I shared this discussion:\n\nX: “Surely the great masters of old knew the spirit world is equal—so why use Hell, demons, and punishments to scare people into virtue?”\n\nThey replied: “It was the era. Humanity was warlike, greedy, selfish, scrambling for advantage. Religion had to impose strict rules—extraordinary measures for extraordinary times—to prevent excessive violence and karmic burden, lest souls linger on Earth too long and fail to return to the stars.\n\nBut modern people, shaped by centuries of education and progress, are no longer suited to Hell-threats or overblown praise as control tools. People need the gentle, compassionate energy of the New Age, in harmony with the cosmos, awakening true inner goodness and reaffirming the self.\n\n“We’re training new guides to awaken humanity. People will rise from within, recognizing the soul’s will. This longing will propel you to seek, to meet teachers and traditions. In this interweave of old and new culture, you’ll transform a lifetime of spiritual knowledge, learn more lessons, grow steady in relationships, and finally return to self-realization. The journey has only begun.”\n\n\n\nT: If the Holy Spirit is compassionate, It would never use violence to restrain violence, nor condemn anyone to eternal punishment. Hell, as tradition describes it, is a human-made structure. Flip the concept and it becomes clear:\n\nHell is the manifestation of conscience—the subconscious choice born from regret over life’s failures.\n\n\n\nT: But we have a choice. We need not endure such harsh self-punishment. It’s useless. We are alive; we can change; we are changing. We’re learning to live in peace, even to know when to say “no.” This tests inner wisdom and the soul’s priorities. Even the sharpest stone, once smoothed, still retains value.\n\n\n\nT: Once, an elemental said to X:\n\n“Wisdom is seeing the good in the most ordinary things.”\n\nI pass these words to you.\n\n\n\nT: When we find peace and joy from within, Heaven is already here. Since we can create Hell, we can also bring Heaven—creating peace for body, mind, and soul.\n\n\n\nQ & A\n\n\n\nQ: So when people die, do they forget everything until they reunite with their original soul?\n\nA: At death, people don’t realize they’ve died. Few are calm enough to accept it. Most panic—feeling abandoned, forsaken, angry—too many emotions. The heavy fragments fall like comet shards.\n\nOnly when death is accepted with serenity does one feel Heaven’s gentle love, blending with the primordial soul like being held by parents (for before that, one may not even know the primordial soul exists). There is light, warmth, and a sense of being upheld.\n\nBut that’s all. The primordial soul doesn’t spend long discussing. Awareness, once absorbed, is like a single cell returning to the body—becoming a screw within a great machine. Only in cases like mine, with communication across lifetimes, do my past selves realize they held many identities, statuses, and genders. In the merging, these past selves become advisors—though they sometimes argue and dislike one another. XD\n\nIn the end, it all depends on coordination and mutual understanding. (Extremely complex!)\n\n"

    "selftext": "TL;DR: my partner is interviewing for a position that he's overqualified for and pays a little less than he makes now - how do you explain that to a recruiter or hiring manager?\n\nI'll try to keep this as concise as possible - my partner found out through the grapevine that his employer is seeking to replace him (a remote employee) with someone local to the area, so he's been seeking other employment. \n\nMy partner's also a sole proprietor running a small business, and business has been pretty good. As his business is growing, a more flexible \"day job\" is beneficial and taking a lower salary isn't such a big deal.\n\nHe applied to a position with a company where he knows a few people, including someone well up the chain (I don't remember his position, but think director or chief officer). He's received word from a couple of those folks that he should expect a call for a phone interview today or Monday. \n\nHis current position is sort of his employer's equivalent to director of IT. The position he's applied for is an escalated client support position, and the upper end of the salary range in the job requisition is still a little lower than what he makes now. His experience makes him a great fit, and if anything, he's a little overqualified.  He knows and really believes in their products and services, which is great. \n\nIf it comes up, he can't exactly say, \"this is actually secondary income and healthcare benefits for me.\" He also doesn't want to divulge his side business at all (it's not a conflict of interest, but who's going to hire someone if they think the position isn't their primary focus?). He can't say, \"I want less responsibility.\" I don't think he can get away with lamenting his current unpredictable hours. The position he's interviewing for requires some travel, so he's hesitant to talk about the travel at his current position being much more than he signed up for.\n\nAny suggestions are so appreciated! He really is excited for this particular opportunity, and losing his current position with nothing else lined up would be devastating for us. Thanks in advance!"

    "selftext": "I ran 10 Candles last night for halloween. I tend to prefer serious stories and serious TTRPG sessions but I know that many if not most TTRPG players prefer goofy zany TTRPG play. For this session, I, as always , silently preferred a serious stone-faced experience, and was a little concerned that the game wouldn't work if players went goofy.\n\nPlayers DID , in fact, go goofy.  Not only did they take a goofy approach with characters, but they also threw in 2 layered elements which I was also afraid would not work with 10 candles:\n\n1. 2 players , using the narrative rights powers, choose to transform into \"them\", the ontological enemy, monster faction in all 10 candles games.\n\n2. These 2 players then, created a kind of psychic romance with each other, another thematic element that I did not expect in the game.\n\nHowever...\n\nAmazingly, the game STILL WORKED! We patched up the problem of 2 players turning into monsters by having a military kill team, who believed all players to be infected mutants, to chase them all down.\n\nThe goofiness worked fairly well with the story becoming about over-the-top battles and explosive deaths between human players, mutant players, and brutal soldiers.\n\nThe finale ended up looking similar to the last scene of the 1972 film \"The harder they come\", with the final surviving player attempting to use a big alien gun he'd found to take on a whole platoon of soldiers with the 1 remaining die + 1 hope die and being blasted to bits.\n\nI think that that the main reason why the game still worked was, first off, the tight dice mechanics, and second, the narrative mechanics. Players by luck won narrative control the vast majority of the game and I kept asking questions to help them both tie the story elements together and to keep tension and conflict in the story.\n\n\n2 other points I want to make:\n\n1. The game actually works equally fantastically with any vaguely isolating horror scenario and you actually lose nothing by skipping the \"darkness apocalypse\" theme. Go camping, go to a space station, go to a remote archaeology site, get locked in a mall after hours, it all works as long as the place youre stuck in is dark or even just dangerous.\n\n2. The only criticism i have for the game is that we found it was not viable or feasible to actually burn the ability cards indoors. It created so much smoke that we had to stop doing it to avoid triggering the smoke alarm. To do this properly you'd have to be in a pitch dark outdoor place which is a pretty tall order for urban dwellers."

    "selftext": "My entire life, I’ve been overweight. Even as a baby, I came out at almost nine and a half pounds. And throughout school, I was teased for being the chubby and fat kid. But I never let the teasing get to me. Sure, I was fat, but it didn’t hamper my life too badly. I was fat, but not obese, and I was able to live my life completely normally, aside of course from the odd bullying incident. In fact, my bulk even allowed me a spot on the football team once I reached high school. And I became the best defensive lineman the school had in years. I felt on top of the world.\n\n\n\nBut once graduation came around, and I wasn’t able to land my dream college, things began to spiral out of control for me. The friends I had made on the team managed to get into their schools, and they left off to fulfill their dreams. I thought that if, instead of going straight into college, I got a job, I might be able to get into a better school. However, living in the Rust Belt, job opportunities didn’t readily line up for me. And I ended up working as a gas station attendant. And unfortunately for me, the sedentary lifestyle quickly crept up on me. \n\n\n\nSince the owner was alright with me eating on the job, and since I worked as many hours as I could, I mindlessly stuffed my face with food. Soon, the pounds just began to pile on. I graduated from school at around 250 pounds. By the time I turned 25, I was almost over 400 pounds. And by that point, I had given up on going to college. I had no more dreams; all I had was the boring day-to-day work I was trapped in. While I was earning a decent enough income from all the hours I worked, I wasn’t putting any of it to use. All the money went to food or new clothes once my fat body had outgrown the previous articles. \n\n\n\nIf I was teased before because of my weight, it became even worse once I ballooned. The words from my close friends and family that they thought I couldn’t hear. The customers who looked at me in disgust as I rang them up. They treated me like some diseased freak, like just looking upon me would result in them suddenly gaining all the weight I had. Or that I might explode all over them like a video game zombie. And I had to deal with it every day. I tried to exercise and diet, but the hardest thing about having a lifestyle change is actually sticking with it. \n\n\n\nThings became so drastic for me that as I began to inch closer and closer to four hundred pounds, I became desperate. Trying starvation diets and even seriously considering trying a tapeworm diet. I had heard the wonder stories of all these new drugs that just help you lose all that weight easily, no hassle at all. I had tried a few of the readily available ones, and they helped me lose a couple of pounds here and there, but as always, my weight would just climb back through the roof. And the meds that actually worked, Ozempec and the others like it, were priced out of my range. Without insurance, it would be ludicrously expensive, and with my weight and health conditions, it was doubtful that I could get my own insurance. \n\n\n\nSo I had resigned myself to dying early. Probably from a heart attack or from diabetes. As if anyone would miss a fatass like me. That was until a friend I’d made at the gas station approached me. I didn’t work alone at the gas station; every now and then, I’d have a coworker. They were usually repulsed at me when they laid eyes on my fat body, but they were soon won over by how friendly and kind I was to them. One of these coworkers was Camila. \n\n\n\nShe had started working here about two years ago, and we had soon become close friends with each other. Camila wasn’t disgusted as the others usually were when she met me, or if she had been, she hid it incredibly well. I can usually tell when someone is putting up an act of being nice to me, but she genuinely seemed unbothered by my body. It was a breath of fresh air, and we often spent our long shifts talking and playing little games with each other. She was a ray of sunshine in the dim fog that had surrounded my life. \n\n\n\nCamila had a secret, however, and it was one I had accidentally discovered when I had gone into the woman’s bathroom to replace the soap. I entered and found her shooting up heroin in one of the stalls. She had begged me not to tell the owner that she was desperate to keep this job. I figured she was desperate to keep the job to buy more heroin, but I wasn’t any better. We were both addicted to something. I was addicted to food, and she happened to be addicted to a harder substance. So, I looked the other way. But from then on, I kept an eye on her. Making sure both that she didn’t try to rob the register for cash and that if she was shooting up in the bathroom, that she didn’t OD in it. \n\n\n\nI suppose also subconsciously, I didn’t want to lose such a good friend. She was the one bright spot in my life, so I kept an eye on her. One day, while I was counting the money in the register, she quickly ran up to me and seemed like she was ready to explode with excitement. \n\n\n\n“What is it this time?” I asked with a smile as I counted in my head. Already I was winded from simply standing, my knees aching as the weight of my bulk pressed down on them. Satisfied that the till was correct, I placed the money back in and turned to look at her. \n\n\n\n“I know a way for you to get a weight loss drug!” she said with excitement, her jet black curls bouncing up and down in the air as she stared up at me. “I have a…friend, who can help you!” She said, trailing away at the mention of her friend. I crossed my arms at her, peering down and watching as she stood there innocently before. \n\n\n\n“What kind of friend is it?” I asked her, walking over to the large chair I was allowed to sit in during working hours. It creaked and groaned under my weight, reminding me every time I sat down in it about how I was probably a couple of snacks away from snapping and breaking it into pieces. Whatever Camila was offering me seemed way too good to be true. \n\n\n\n“He’s just a friend! He’s coming around later today, and I can introduce you to him! He’s been working on a new drug that could help you lose weight!” she said with excitement. I, however, was unconvinced. She just happened to know some random guy who just so happened to be able to give me a magic drug that would help me lose weight? \n\n\n\n“I’m having a real hard time believing you.” I sighed, leaning back ever so slightly in my chair. It creaked and groaned louder, practically begging me to get off of it. I relented and sat back up, relieving some pressure on it. “How can some random guy you know just have this drug?” I asked her, to which she seemed less excited to tell me, avoiding my gaze and looking out into the empty gas station store. \n\n\n\n“Just listen to what he has to say! Pretty please, Reggie?” She looked back at me with her big brown eyes. I stared back at her and sighed, rubbing my face and becoming all too aware of how fat my face was getting. I had a double chin already, and no doubt a third one was quickly forming. What did I realistically have to lose? A couple of minutes of some crazy person’s speech? \n\n\n\n“Alright, fine,” I sighed. Camila wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hard hug, thanking me over and over again. I wondered why she seemed more excited than I was at this opportunity. We both were working the night shift, so I didn’t know when this friend of hers would show up. As the hours ticked by, I was sure that he had probably flaked on us. It wasn’t until 2:30 in the morning that someone showed up.\n\n\n\nThe front door to the store swung open and beeped. I looked up from my phone, an extra-large soft drink in my hand, as I looked over to see who it was. Walking into the store was the sketchiest guy I’d ever seen. He was wearing a hoodie and a turtleneck, with a face mask covering the lower half of his face. His hands were firmly placed in his hoodie pocket, and he had the most unsettling look in his eyes. It wasn’t a threatening look, but a look of extreme indifference. He walked up to the counter and nodded at me. \n\n\n\n“Carton of Newports,” he said. His voice sounded hollow, like he was talking to me through a tube somehow, and it was muffled from the mask, so it took me a moment to understand his request. I nodded slightly before slowly turning my back to him. I half expected him to pull out a gun on me, but surprisingly, he waited patiently as I picked up the carton for him and brought it to the register. \n\n\n\n“Spencer!” Camila cried out, startling me so badly I accidentally rang him up twice. I looked behind me to see that she had seemingly popped up out of nowhere. She smiled at the mystery man, who nodded back at her. “This is the guy I was talking about, Reggie!” I looked back at Spencer, who had pulled his wallet out and was riffling through what looked like my entire paycheck for a month's worth of money. \n\n\n\n“You’re the guy with the weight loss drug?” I asked him. He nodded as he handed me a hundred-dollar bill for his carton. I took it and quickly confirmed that it was real before giving him his change. He nodded and placed his gloved hands back in his hoodie pocket. \n\n\n\n“It’s a trial run I’m doing. I asked a couple of my clients if they knew anyone in their life who was morbidly obese to let me know.” I was skeptical, and he could probably tell. He pulled his carton of cigarettes over to him and looked at the clock on the wall behind me. “When do you two get off of work?” he asked, opening the carton and fishing out a box of cigarettes. \n\n\n\n“We both get off at 3,” I told him, looking over to see that Camila was still next to me, and still buzzing with excitement over this whole thing. Spencer nodded as he smacked his box of Newports against his palm. \n\n\n\n“Cool, I’ll hang around and give you the whole pitch when you’re off the clock.” He walked away from both of us and headed outside, surrounded in darkness. I watched as a brief flicker of light appeared outside as he lit his cigarette. \n\n\n\n“I don’t trust him,” I told Camila as we started to ready the gas station shop for closing. She nodded her head as she helped me take inventory of everything. \n\n\n\n“I know he looks super sketchy, but trust me! Spencer is a freaking genius! His stuff is always high quality, and I’ve never gotten a bad deal with him,” she said with a giggle. I looked at her for a moment before suddenly realizing what it was that she meant. \n\n\n\n“Is he you’re fucking drug dealer?” I asked her. She looked over at me before sheepishly nodding. “I should’ve fucking known.” I sighed, tossing the clipboard I was holding on the counter and crossing my arms at her. “What the fuck, dude?” \n\n\n\n“Look! I know it seems really bad. But he promised I could get more of his product this way! And it also helps you out, Reggie! Just, pretty please, hear him out! That’s all I’m asking for!” She begged me, literally getting on her hands and knees and begging me. I sighed hard and rubbed my head. Already, I felt exhausted from standing again. And it was only going to get worse the fatter I got. How much longer did I realistically have left to live if I continued like this? What was the harm in listening to him? I was most likely going to die early anyway. \n\n\n\n“Fine. But I’m still pissed at you.” I picked up the clipboard and continued with the inventory as Camila thanked me a million times. I knew she was just happy to keep getting her heroin, but it still made me happy to see her so excited. I wanted her to beat her demons as well, and I was hoping that losing weight would also allow me to get the courage to ask her out. If I were with her, I could hopefully help her with the addiction. \n\n\n\nOnce we had finished locking up the gas station, we made our way out and saw that Spencer was waiting for us, leaning on the wall and playing around with a Zippo lighter. He looked over at us and nodded, closing the lighter and shoving it in his pocket. We both approached him, and I wheezed slightly as I did so, more aware than ever of how fat I was. \n\n\n\n“So, ready to hear my pitch?” Spencer asked, the stench of cigarettes rising off of him. I nodded and almost wished I had a chair to sit down in. But I stayed standing as the drug dealer began to let me in on what he was doing. “It’s a little side project I’ve been working on. All you’ll have to do is inject yourself and record the progress that happens. Let me know of any side effects you might encounter. It’s only a trial run, so don’t expect it to work perfectly,” he told me, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a ziplock bag. It contained a syringe and needle, along with a vial of some mystery liquid. \n\n\n\n“How do I know this shit won’t just kill me?” I asked him, unsure of how I felt about the presentation of this wonder drug. Spencer stared at me for a minute before lowering his gaze to my large, protruding stomach. \n\n\n\n“Can’t be any worse than what you’re doing to yourself now,” he said, shaking the bag at me like it was a treat. I tsked angrily at him and grabbed the bag off him. “Inject yourself in the abdominal area. Don’t worry, the needle is sterile, but if you don’t trust me, you can clean it yourself. There are instructions as well, follow them and don’t deviate from them.” He reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled out another baggie, this one containing a folded up block of tin foil. “Here you go, Cam.” He tossed the bag to Camila, who caught it with an excited shriek. \n\n\n\n“Thanks, Spence! You’re the best! See you tomorrow, Reggie!” She practically sprinted to her car and left me alone with Spencer. We both stared at each other before I shoved the bag into my pocket. He nodded at me before again reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small flip phone. \n\n\n\n“How much room you got in there?” I asked as he tossed the phone at me. I caught it and looked back to see him walking away from me. “What number do I call you on?” I called out to him. \n\n\n\n“The only number that’s on the phone, genius. Once a day, understand?” He called back to me as he disappeared into the darkness of the parking lot. I looked back down at the phone before shoving it into my pocket. I took a deep breath and slowly made my way to my car. I arrived back at my lonely apartment and tossed my keys on the counter. I watered my plants and then walked over to the bathroom. I pulled my shirt off and stared at myself in the mirror. I was completely unrecognizable. My stomach was huge and drooped down far enough, almost to cover my knees. My face was puffy with fat, and I looked one burger away from a heart attack. I pulled out the baggy and fished out the instructions. \n\n\n\n“One injection a day of 2 mL.” I nodded at the simple instructions before pulling the needle and syringe out. I decided to sterilize it further and boiled it in a pot of water for half an hour. Putting on some latex gloves I had lying around, I put the needle back on the syringe with some difficulty, my sausage fingers refusing to comply with me. Finally, with the needle sterilized, I pierced the vial and pulled out exactly 2 mL of fluid. It was a clear fluid which didn’t instill me with confidence, but I supposed it was better than if it were neon green or something. \n\n\n\nI took a deep breath and stared at myself in the mirror one last time. Before injecting myself and pushing the plunger down. I grunted a little once I pulled the needle out and placed it in the sink. I stared at myself for a moment before shrugging and heading to bed. I didn’t exactly expect it to begin working overnight, so I lay my head down on my bed and went to sleep. \n\n\n\nWhen I next woke up, I was in unbelievable pain. Not just at the injection spot, but across my entire body. It was like my whole body was on fire, but there wasn’t any flame to be seen. I gasped and grunted in pain, quickly reaching out and pulling the phone that Spencer had given me. I dialed the only saved number on the phone and waited an agonizing few seconds for him to pick up. \n\n\n\n“Whole body pain, huh?” he asked me, completely nonchalant, as if he had to deal with this daily. “That’s normal. It’s going to feel like shit at first, but just drink some water and you’ll feel better.” Before I could say anything else, he hung up on me. I tossed the phone away as I stumbled out of bed. Every movement was pure agony as I crawled my way over to a packet of water bottles I had lying on the floor. I tore into the packaging and ripped the bottle open with my teeth, guzzling down the water in an attempt to stop the pain. \n\n\n\nAnd to my immediate surprise, it did stop. As soon as the bottle of water was gone, so was my pain. I stood up from the floor and felt no pain at all. I made my way over to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. There wasn’t any difference, but when I weighed myself, I was surprised to discover that I now weighed a few pounds less than the day before. At first, I was sure that this was all due to dehydration, but as I walked over to the kitchen to get something to eat, I suddenly realized that I wasn’t hungry at all. Not even a little peckish. \n\n\n\nThe surprises continued as I started my day of work at the gas station. I had no appetite at all, and soon enough, when the pain started to creep back up across my entire body, a quick guzzle of water was enough to quickly kill the pain without much fuss. I spent the entire day at work, still winded from standing for long periods, but also without eating a single thing. Even when I had forced myself to during my starvation diets, I had needed to be eating or snacking constantly. But now I didn’t even feel like chewing on gum. Camila didn’t work that day, so I had no one to tell about what I was going through, but it felt surreal to not have a snack or a soda on hand. \n\n\n\nAnd upon returning home from work, I quickly walked past the fridge and straight to the bathroom mirror, water bottle firmly in my hand as I quickly guzzled it down. Once I had finished with the bottle, I lifted my shirt to look at my body. There wasn’t any difference, but to my surprise, there was a small black bruise where I had injected myself. I wondered if I had simply done it too hard and had somehow caused a bruise. Giving it a gentle poke, it certainly stung like a bruise, so that’s what I went with. \n\n\n\nAfter again sterilizing the needle in a pot of boiling water, I extracted exactly 2mL and injected myself close to the initial site, but far enough away so as not to damage the bruise. I quickly slammed down another water bottle after I had injected myself, and went over to my couch. Sitting down and pulling my shirt back on, I dug the burner phone out of my pocket and quickly dialed Spencer to check in for the day. \n\n\n\n“Hm?” He grunted as he answered his phone. It sounded like he was at a party or something, since in the background I could hear the excited cries of people and the blaring of music. It made sense that Spencer would hang out in clubs, dealing drugs to people. \n\n\n\n“I just injected myself for the second time. I haven’t had an appetite at all today.” I told him. I was wondering if he could hear me over how loud the music was on his end, but he seemed to be able to just fine. He responded that everything was normal and asked if I was experiencing any other symptoms. “Well, there was a bruise that appeared at the injection site. Is that something I should worry about?” I asked. He was silent for a moment, with only the loud, blaring music coming from the background of his call. Soon, however, the music cut out, and he cleared his throat. \n\n\n\n“Sorry, I went somewhere where I could hear you better. A bruise, huh? How big is it?” He asked, suddenly sounding incredibly curious about this. I explained to him that it was barely the size of a bug bite. “Alright, keep an eye on it. Other than that, stick to the treatment. See ya.” Without waiting for a response, he hung up on me. Tossing the burner phone on the couch, I looked down at my stomach and wondered to myself if I should be worried. I decided to keep going for a few days and see what happened to me. \n\n\n\nWhat ended up happening to me was that over the course of an entire week, I dropped nearly a hundred pounds. It was sudden and caught everyone, including me, off guard. The drug had completely removed my appetite, and from only drinking water, it seemed that my body was literally burning the calories and fat right off my body. I was soon able to fit into clothes that I had put away to be donated, and nearly everyone I knew was shocked by my sudden and rapid loss of weight. Even Camila was floored by me when she arrived at work to see me down to nearly 250 pounds. \n\n\n\nThere was, however, a lingering issue. The bruise on my stomach had grown larger. From the size of a mosquito bite, it had slowly grown from each subsequent injection. It now covered nearly my entire torso, and it looked as if I had been in some horrible car accident and was badly hurt. While I had lost all this weight and was still doing so, the bruise was spreading across my body and making me increasingly fearful. \n\n\n\n“That big, huh?” Spencer asked, completely nonchalant at my panic. I was again staring at myself in the mirror and giving the bruise a soft poke. It was so painful that even just applying the slightest pressure was nearly enough to bring me to my knees in agony. “I guess I can swing around your place to check on it,” Spencer sighed, clearly annoyed by all of this. \n\n\n\n“Please! This looks really bad, and it hurts so much!” I called out to him. \n\n\n\n“Yeah, yeah, tell me your address and I’ll be there.” He sighed in annoyance. I quickly told him my address before hanging up and continuing to stare at myself in the mirror. The bruise covered nearly the entire right side of my torso, and every movement of my body seemed to upset it. As I was about to put my shirt back on as carefully as I could, I noticed that something was leaking out of my stomach. \n\n\n\nDropping my shirt, I brought my hand close to the source of the fluid. I gently rubbed some on my finger and instinctively brought it up to my nose to smell it. I was instantly punched in the face with a noxious stench that I could only describe as a garbage can meets a swamp. I hacked and nearly vomited, saved only by the fact that I had no food in my stomach to throw up. What was this fluid? And why the fuck was it leaking out of my body?\n\n\n\nI quickly exited the bathroom and ran to my room, quickly grabbing a belt and running back to the bathroom. I bit down on the folded leather belt and gently grabbed my stomach, grunting loudly as the pain started to build. Biting down as hard as I could on the belt, and squeezed my belly and, to my horror, watched as more of the foul smelling fluid began to leak out of the injection sites. The pain was on the level I could only describe as breaking both of your femurs at the same time, and my vision went white as I soon tumbled to the floor. \n\n\n\nI soon awoke to Spencer staring down at me. We were still in my bathroom, but my entire body felt like it was on fire. I hadn’t had a drink of water yet, and it felt like my body was being consumed in flames and being crushed at the same time. Spencer knelt down and examined my shirtless body, poking it with his gloved hands and causing me to cry out in pain as he did so. He seemed fascinated by my body, and I was unable to do anything but grunt and whine in pain on the floor. \n\n\n\n“Well, this wasn’t supposed to happen.” He sighed, looking at me and again poking my stomach with his incredibly bony finger. I cried out in pain and tried to lift my arm to smack him away, but I couldn’t so much as lift it off the floor, I was in so much pain. “Well, let’s see what you’re filled with.” He sighed, reaching into his pants pocket and pulling out an empty syringe. I mumbled a protest as my body felt like it was burning up in a blazing furnace. Spencer poked my stomach with his syringe and began to extract some fluid from inside me. \n\n\n\n“Damn, that’s not a good sign.” He sighed, slightly annoyed. I couldn’t see what he had pulled out of my stomach at first, but as he pulled the syringe up and I caught a glimpse of what he’d just pulled out. It was a sickly black and yellow fluid that looked as if I’d put rotten meat in a blender and had liquified it.   \n  \n“What…did you do to me…” I heaved out, suddenly having extreme trouble breathing. He looked over at me and pulled his face mask down. To my shock, the entire lower part of his face was completely rotted away. His jawbone and most of the lower part of his skull were completely exposed, and much of his neck had also started to rot away. My eyes went wide at the horrible scene before me, and I tried to get my body to move, but nothing I was communicating to it was working at all. \n\n\n\n“Guess I have to go back to the drawing board.” He sighed, capping the syringe full of the fluid and placing it in his hoodie pocket. “Here, I’m going to give you something for the pain, and also something that’s probably gonna mess you up some more. Stop taking the meds for now, and just wait for it to leave your system. Sound cool?” he asked, but before I could even tell him to fuck off, he quickly jabbed a needle into my neck. \n\n\n\n“Fuck…you…” I gasped as I soon began to lose consciousness. Just as I fell into the either, I heard Spencer calling someone and lighting a cigarette. When I finally woke up, I had been moved from the floor of my bathroom to the couch in my living room. Looking around for Spencer, expecting him to be hovering over me like some horrible grim reaper, I was instead surprised to find Camila waiting for me. \n\n\n\n“Oh, thank god that you’re awake!” She sighed and quickly came over to me, sitting on the floor and helping me gently sit up. “Spencer called me and said something was wrong with you.” I looked around my apartment to quickly see if he was still there, but it seemed that only Camila was here. \n\n\n\n“He’s a monster.” I started to tell her, sitting up from the couch, and I suddenly found that I had no more pain. Not even from the bruise on my body. “He…he has no face. Or…or half his face is gone.” I told her, suddenly realizing how insane I sounded. And looking at Camila, it was obvious from her facial expressions that she thought I was delusional. \n\n\n\n“Here, let me get you a glass of water. You should also try and eat something.” She quickly stood from the floor and headed over to my kitchen. I sighed deeply and began to rub my face, racking my brain over the events I had just witnessed. Had I really just been hallucinating from the pain of my bruise? But I had seen Spencer’s face so clearly, or I suppose half of his face. Camila came back over with a glass of water and a small sandwich for me to eat. \n\n\n\nThanking her, I took a small sip of water and stared down at the sandwich. It was a simple ham one, with a little bit of lettuce and a tomato. It had occurred to me that since starting Spencer’s weight loss drug, I hadn’t had a single ounce of hunger, and because of this, I hadn’t eaten anything. I took a small bite of the sandwich and chewed on it. As I went to swallow it, however, my body reacted violently. All at once, I felt violently ill. I dropped the sandwich and the glass of water and sprinted to the bathroom as fast as I could. \n\n\n\nAs I threw up violently into the toilet, listening to Camila’s worried knocks at the door and muffled words, I stared down into the bowl. Floating there was the same black and yellow pile from the syringe that Spener had pulled out of me. There was also a small piece of the sandwich I had eaten, but more horrifying was a few chunks of what looked like meat floating in there along with the sandwich. I hadn’t eaten anything for a week. Where the hell had that meat come from? \n\n\n\nFor the next few days, my situation deteriorated further. The weight continued to fall off of me even after I’d stopped taking the drug. Soon, I had dropped to 200 pounds. And now I was throwing up more frequently, and each time there were more and more of the mystery chunks in my toilet bowl. I fished some out of the bowl and put them into a zip-lock bag. Biting the bullet and figuring it was worth the price, I headed to the hospital. They were just as dumbfounded as I was. I tried to explain to them what I was going through, but of course, none of them believed me. \n\n\n\nThat was until I was given an MRI. The doctors pulled me aside and demanded to know what was really going on with me. They wondered how I could possibly be alive when most of my internal organs were rotting away inside me. The meat chunks had been what was left of my few remaining organs. I tried to tell them again everything that had happened to me, even pulling up my hospital gown and squeezing my stomach at them. To their horror, the same foul smelling liquid seeped out. \n\n\n\nI was kept in the hospital, but I continued to lose both weight and more of my internal organs. And yet I was still being kept alive. I wasn’t even placed on an IV bag, because for all intents and purposes, I was completely ‘healthy’. Even my sagging skin began to disappear, as it seemed to cling to my bones like I’d been vacuum-sealed. Soon, my weight dipped down to 150 pounds, and continued to fall. Camila visited me often, and I could tell how worried she was by my appearance. My face had become sunken, and I looked no better than an actual skeleton. She stayed by my side, and to my surprise, she even told me that she had checked herself into a rehab facility. Seeing what Spencer had done to me had scared her into kicking her heroin habit, and for that I was thankful. \n\n\n\nA few days after my weight had dropped to 100 pounds, and I was confined to my bed, another visitor showed up. It was after hours in the middle of the night. Staring up at the ceiling, I wondered how much longer my body would hold up. How much longer until I simply died from what was happening to me? Suddenly, the door to my room opened. I expected it to be a doctor or a nurse, coming in to check on me, or oggle at the oddity they had on their hand. Using the remote to push my bed up slightly, I was horrified to see Spencer standing at the foot of my bed, reading my chart. \n\n\n\n“I was wondering why I hadn’t heard from you.” He told me, pulling his face mask down again. It proved that I hadn’t been crazy or hallucinating, half of his face really had rotten away. “I’m a little hurt that you decided to come to a hospital before you came to me.” He sighed, walking around my bed and taking a seat next to me. I frantically began to search for the remote to call for my nurse, but Spencer waggled it at my face as he continued to read my chart. \n\n\n\n“Get away from me! You’re the reason this happened to me! Nurse! Nurse, help!” I screamed, but Spencer seemed entirely unconcerned with my pleas for help. He just flipped through my chart, his brow rising at some points. No matter how hard I tried to call for my nurse, it seemed like no one could hear us. I frantically started pulling my IV and my heart monitor patches off, hoping that if they thought I was flatlining, they’d come running. But Spencer casually reached over to the monitor and silenced it after only one beep. \n\n\n\n“Organ failure, organ necrosis, drastic weight loss.” He read through my chart aloud before tossing it over his shoulder and staring at me for a few moments. “Not my best work, unfortunately. But I guess you did lose a lot of weight. I barely recognized you walking in here.” He said with a dry giggle. I gritted my teeth and lunged at him, but before I could get my skeletal hands around his throat, he shoved the barrel of a gun in my face. “Don’t touch me. I’ve got a thing with germs.” He pushed his chair further away before staring at me, gun still pointed at me. \n\n\n\n“You might as well just shoot me, I’m probably going to die anyway, right? Why the fuck haven’t I? My stomach, liver, kidneys, both intestines, they’re gone! How is that possible? What did you do to me, you freak?!” I screamed at him. He sighed, pulling his box of cigarettes and placing one in his mouth. \n\n\n\n“I thought that if I combined both weight loss and skin loss into one drug, it’d work better.” He explained, lighting his cigarette and blowing the noxious cloud in my face. The smoke from his cigarette permeated throughout the various holes in his skull. It seeped through where his nose should’ve been, through the gaps in his teeth, and even out the sides where his cheeks should’ve been. “Clearly, that didn’t work. As to how you’re alive, that drug I gave you is keeping you going. It’s a good thing I got here, since you’re due for another injection. Unless you want to keel over and experience what total organ failure feels like all at once.” He took another drag of his cigarette. \n\n\n\n“What kind of monster are you?” I asked him, clutching my blankets tightly. He offered me another laugh, the smoke escaping his various crevices as he did so. \n\n\n\n“Trust me, dude. There’s way worse ones out there than me.” He pulled out another syringe and held it up to me. “You either take this and stop your impending death, or you die here. I know what I would pick.” He waggled the syringe at me like it was a pencil. \n\n\n\n“What’s going to happen to me even if I take that? Am I just going to wither away into nothing?” I asked him, staring down at my emaciated body. \n\n\n\n“I have a theory that might work. But it’s going to require you to take the injection first.” He continued to waggle the syringe at me. I stared at him and the mysterious contents of his syringe, before nodding and turning away. He reconnected my IV and poured the contents of the mysterious syringe into the bag. \n\n\n\n“Now what?” I asked, watching as the bag turned from clear to a strange mix of blue and green. It suddenly hit me with an intense sense of drowsiness, and soon I passed out before I could even fully comprehend what was happening. When I next woke up, it wasn’t in the hospital room. It was in my own apartment, but I was chained to my own bed. I tried to tug against the restraints, but despite how skinny and skeletal I was, the restraints were wrapped around me tightly. \n\n\n\n“Sup?” Spencer asked, eating what looked to be a chocolate bar from my cupboard. “Welcome home. I brought you some food.” He waved a package of meat at me before tossing it on the bed. “If you promise not to bitch, I’ll untie you. Otherwise, you don’t get any food.” He bit into the chocolate bar, and watching him eat with only his jaw and no muscles disgusted me. \n\n\n\n“I can’t eat with no stomach, dumbass!” I shouted at him, fighting against the restraints. He sighed and grabbed the packaged meat. He ripped it open and waved a piece of the meat in front of my face. I grimaced at it, realizing that it smelled awful. But before I could protest, Spencer shoved the stinking piece of meat into my mouth. He shoved it completely in my mouth and covered it with his gloved hands. I gagged and choked, and with no way of spitting it out, forcefully swallowed the mass of meat. \n\n\n\nI waited for the vomit that would no doubt ensue, but it didn’t happen. After a moment, Spencer pulled his hand back and made a show of wiping it on my bed. The meat had no taste, despite how foul it smelled. Staring at it with curiosity, I then looked over at Spencer, and I didn’t need to ask him the obvious question. \n\n\n\n“It’s better you didn’t know,” he said, standing up and leaving me alone with the package of meat. Knowing Spencer, it could’ve been anything, and I had a horrible idea of what it might actually be. After a while, Spencer came back and unlocked my restraints. For the first time in forever, I was consumed by a hunger like no other. I quickly dug into the meat and literally tore it to shreds in a few seconds. \n\n\n\n“I’ll drop by every few days to leave you meat. Try not to cause any trouble.” He told me as he dropped more packages of meat for me onto the floor. Without thinking at all, I pounced on them and literally began to tear into the packages as fast as I could. The absence of taste didn’t bother me at all, it was the sensation of being able to eat something. \n\n\n\nSoon, the days began to blur as my entire life began to revolve around Spencer's visits for the delivery of meat. I began to turn into a mindless creature that only craved the delivery of meat, and every day waiting for more of it drove me insane. I felt every pang of hunger that I hadn’t felt before, every ceaseless pain that roared from my abdomen.\n\n\n\nOne day, there was an aggressive knock on the door. I stared up quickly. I had been crawling around on all fours, trying my best to find some source of meat to eat. My apartment had deteriorated around me, and it was a mess of flies and rats. Juicy, yummy, delicious rats. The knock became harsher and angrier, and I quickly scurried underneath one of the cupboards and hid. The door soon flung open, and soon I heard the wretching sounds of my landlord. \n\n\n\n“Jesus Fucking Christ, what has that fatass been doing in here?” he hissed in anger, entering my apartment and wading through the mass of trash. “Reggie! Where the fuck are you?! I’m evicting your fatass!” he shouted. I gently peered out of my cupboard and stared at my landlord. Slowly, drool began to build up in my mouth as I watched him. He was meat. He was meat, and here he was. I opened the cupboard and slowly stalked him as he headed for my bedroom. As he threw open the door and was hit by a huge noxious cloud of flies and the smell of rot, I pounced on him from behind. I sank my teeth into his delicious neck meat and tore it to shreds, happily chewing on it and going for another giant bite. \n\n\n\nBy the time Spencer arrived at the apartment, I had completely devoured my landlord and was in the process of desperately cracking his bones open and sucking the marrow out. Spencer sighed in annoyance and knelt next to me as I vigorously tore into the remaining marrow in the femur. \n\n\n\n“You’re a pain in the ass.” He sighed, standing up and pulling out his cellphone to make a call. I didn’t care about what he was planning to do with me. I was more excited by the delivery of the meat he had given me. I crawled over to it on my emaciated arms and legs and quickly tore into the package, completely absorbed into the juicy, delicious, and succulent flesh. \n\n\n\nAs long as I can have flesh, he can do whatever he wants with me. \n\n"

So, Sunny was a little pleased to show her his new abode... even if it had to be briefly. They looked at each other, their eyes igniting with a heated intensity.

Neave is a solid choice since we already have an emotional attachment to him, and G3 already gave us a death flag for him in 2681.\n"

    "selftext": "I always had mind sight ig but didn't know what it was. It would happen when I wake up to pee or something close my eyes and I can still the room sometimes there's bugs too idk why but I just accepted it after a while. Recently tho something weirder happened where I close my eyes to meditate and a purple cloud would appear and if I focus on it a hole opens up and I can clearly on the other side. It's not a still image either. For example I wanted to see between my wardrobe and book case, purple cloud appeared, hole opened up and I could see exactly where I wanted. The only thing is the hole is small so it's like I really have to use my \"eyes\" to see harder but when I focus too hard ofc it disappears. I blindfolded myself to test and same result. Some people say it's mindsight or remote viewing but idk I'm trying to practice when I can. Yesterday I tried again and a hole opened up and I saw 2 silhouetted beings inspecting something from my laying down POV and they were just walking back and forth looking at what I'm guessing is the hole or something idk. Any help would be great "

I told my boss by week 6 because of how sick I felt and because there were days I'd literally be running to the bathroom. \n\nI'm a clinical supervisor for every clinician in my department, I'm also an administrator for the department, and I have a caseload on top of that. I work 1-1.5 hours away from where I live, and we aren't allowed to do any remote work. At all. Like I've witnessed massive push back when someone has had a medical reason with a doctors note to work from home for a short period of time. But I need my job. This is how my family has health insurance, and without that, we would be screwed. ESPECIALLY now that I'm pregnant. \n\nI just keep having the thought of how the hell am I going to do this for another like 7 months? Maybe I will feel better in the coming trimesters, but what if I don't? Now there's the new law, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (2023), but I don't even think my HR department knows about it. My boss didn't even know about it and she had a baby since it passed/went into effect. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Has anyone been in a similar situation? 3 of the last 4 women to get pregnant here didn't return from leave, and I just don't know how to handle the amount of work I have, my commute, all of the doctors appointments, and how sick I feel.

    "selftext": "Yesterday, I was offered a provisional role with the Ministry of Justice, and today I verified my ID and submitted everything for the enhanced DBS checks. I then received an email asking me to log into the MoJ portal and complete the Pre-Appointment Form.\n\nI’m in a bit of a unique situation. I’ve been on Universal Credit (LCWRA) since 2018, so I haven’t been in employment during the last five years or the last ten. On the form, I selected “Unemployed (claiming benefits)” and filled out the relevant details. However, I did some voluntary work with an NGO between 2021 and 2023.\n\nAs part of that, it's asking me to provide a reference, and this is where I’m in a bit of a pickle as to what I do and what details I provide, so I thought I’d explain everything here to see if anyone can help and/or advise.\n\nIn essence, towards the end I was Chair of the organisation, so I was responsible for the day-to-day running, coordination, and oversight. This can be verified through several articles online where my name and role are clearly listed when they’re discussing the organisation, so I’m not too worried about being able to prove what my role and responsibilities were. The issue is that the remaining Director went completely MIA and wasn’t contactable, wasn’t responding to emails, or through any other communication channels I had at the time. In the end, I had no choice but to step down and resign, as it was causing me a lot of unnecessary stress and impacting my health. Bear in mind I was, and still am, disabled and had my health to prioritise.\n\nShortly after I resigned, the organisation was dissolved via compulsory strike-off on Companies House. Therefore, any contact details I would have had for them, such as their work email address, no longer work and are a complete dead end since the organisation is no longer in operation. I also didn’t have any other contact details for them, as all communication was done through a mixture of Zoom, Slack, and email. It was a fully remote organisation with no physical office, as it was set up and operated during the pandemic.\n\nThe only point of contact I do have is one of the founding Directors, who, shortly after setting up the organisation on Companies House as a Community Interest Company in April 2020 and handling the submission of all the necessary documentation, resigned as Director in November 2020 but remained part of the organisation’s management committee. This is someone I worked alongside during my time with the organisation from 2021 to 2023.\n\nThey’d be able to verify my role and responsibilities and have agreed to provide me with a reference, but I’m not sure if the MoJ will accept them as a reference given the above circumstances. The thing is, during the interview, all the examples I gave for each of the behaviour questions were from my time volunteering at this organisation."

    "selftext": "Hey! Attractors-- I hope you are doing great.\n\nIntro on me: I am 23F. My journey in manifestation started 1 year ago, specifically August 2024. In Aug 2024, my fiancé broke up with me, I lost my job, I had no income, and only $800 in my savings account.\n\nI lost someone I loved and lived with for 3+ yrs. We travelled the world together and --- now everything was gone. I hit the rock bottom. I did some poor jobs in attempts to survive myself yet I was paid $50/week. Seeing things going worst, I decided that it is best if I move back to my parents place. That time, I Mom started her spiritual/ manifestation journey.\n\n  \nI was far from all these and totally unaware. My Mom saw my mental state. I was a sinking ship. When I was at my worst, my Mom introduced me to the Law of Attraction. She thought me the power of Law of Attraction to manifest anything, to bring your desires to life. She thought me how every thought in my head shapes the reality, the world which i live in.\n\n  \nIntroducing me to the core concept of thoughts shaping the reality and attracting situation -- she shared with me a 21-days methodology. In this method- you first describe and writing down a script. A script of what you want in details, as much as you can. Mention a date-- if you have one in mind. For my situation that time, all I needed was a remote job with $3000/month income by the end of Nov 2024. I gave myself roughly 2 months for job hunting. $3000/month would be blessing for someone like me who is living in Asia. \n\nThat was all I wanted. A date, remote job, and income defined. My script was 3 to 5 lines. Something like \"I am working remote full time with a company. I am earning USD $3000/month from 1st Dec, 2025. I am super happy with this job. Thank you\" \n\nOnce you describe what you want and have a script written down, you can begin the 21 days framework. For 21 days, every morning after wake up, before your feet touch the floor or you use your phone -- you open a book, and on a fresh page with green pen write down the script while speaking softly with your voice. And with every word -- feeling it, visualizing it. Feel how would it be to have what you want, try to visualize small things -- cal Google Meet call, or getting that money in bank. Repeat for 21 days and surrender that your desire will be fulfilled. \n\nI did this 21 days framework for 2 times before I landed my job.  I got exactly $3000/month income and I was super happy. \n\n  \nBut now, 1 yr later, I am trying to manifest a job-- I tried x3 times using same steps, same methodologies, same feelings and thoughts yet I am failing. I tried to manifest job multiple times, rectify my thoughts, surrender, Assume it is done yet ....\n\n  \nI feel scared and lost at this point. I researched about Law of Assumption by Neville Goddard, Rhonda Bryne's work and now I am reading book on Ho’oponopono \n\n\n\nBut I don't understand, what is wrong? Am i missing something?\n\nSome way, it is about feelings & my thoughts. Some say- if the manifestation doesn't work out, trust that Universe have some better plan for you. Manifestation failure is sign of something bigger and better for my future.   \n  \nJust seeking some love and support from fellas here. Thank you for your time, if you read till here. "

Never been to Costa Rica before (or really anywhere outside of Canada/the US, so it's a bit overwhelming trying to figure out where to stay/etc.\n\nPrimary Interests:\n\n\\- Hiking/nature, less crowded hiking trails preferred (don't want anything super remote where there are no people at all, or where you basically have to bushwhack through dense forest, but also don't want trails that are completely packed where you have to literally squeeze past other people constantly). I frequently hike in the Alberta rockies, moderate hikes around 8-12 km (3-5 hrs round trip) for reference.\n\n  \n\\- Not really into spending a ton of time at beaches; would be nice to visit, but honestly I'm not really into swimming/surfing, so there wouldn't be a ton for me to do there, other than maybe walk along the beach/see sunrise/sunset/etc.\n\n  \n\\- Not into night life/partying\n\n  \n\\- Interested in trying local food/interacting with locals (I'm learning Spanish right now, so that should be helpful); a bit limited in regard to food choices since I can't have gluten/dairy/eggs haha, so any tips for things to watch out for in that regard would be appreciated.\n\nTentative plans:\n\n\\- Was thinking about flying into the airport at Liberia, renting a small SUV for the week, and staying the entire time at a hotel in Monteverde, then just driving to various areas. If it would make more sense to stay in a different area I'm open to that; would prefer not to have to change hotels much/at all if possible, but not a huge deal if that makes more sense.\n\nBasically just looking for some input on whether my plan makes sense given my interests, or any suggestions at all really would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! :)"
