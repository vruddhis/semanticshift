    "selftext": "I see a lot of hype around Prompt Engineering roles, and while I'm fully in this space, I can't help but wonder about the 5-10 year outlook.\n\nOne argument is that we're essentially beta-testing the next generation of user interfaces. As models get better at inferring intent, the need for complex, hand-tuned prompts will diminish, and the role will be absorbed into other jobs (developer, marketer, etc.).\n\nThe other side argues that this is the birth of a new discipline‚Äîa kind of 'AI psychologist' or 'natural language programmer.' As models become more powerful and integrated, the need for specialists who can communicate with them at a high level will only grow.\n\nPersonally, I lean towards the latter, but I think the role will look *very* different in a few years, focusing more on systems, evaluation, and fine-tuning. What's your take? Is this a fleeting gold rush or the ground floor of a lasting career path?"

The first line has nine syllables, the second eight, and so on until the final line, which has only one syllable. This structure creates a gradual progression or build-up within the poem.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. \"After Apple-Picking\" by Robert Frost.\n\n2. \"Landing Under Water, I See Roots\" by Annie Finch.\n\n3. \"Sonnet to the Past\" by Kenneth Pobo.\n\n**Tips for Creative Writing:**\n\n- **Syntactic Precision:** The nonet's structure encourages clear and concise language.\n\n- **Build Tension:** Utilize the descending syllable count to create a sense of climax.\n\n- **Experiment with Themes:** The nonet is versatile and can explore various emotions and topics.\n\n**Questions for Exploration:**\n\n1. How does the gradual reduction of syllables impact the poem's rhythm and tone?\n\n2. Can you identify any contemporary poets who have effectively employed the nonet form?\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- Explore nonets by modern poets like A.E. Stallings for innovative approaches.\n\n- Read classic nonets to understand how poets from different eras have utilized the form.\n\n**Creative Writing Prompt:**\n\n**Step 1:** Choose a theme or emotion for your nonet.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the descending syllable count for each line (9-8-7, and so on).\n\n**Step 3:** Compose your nine lines, utilizing the gradual reduction of syllables.\n\n**Example:**\nIn twilight's embrace, shadows gently play (9)\nA symphony of hues, the fading day (8)\nSilhouettes dance, a poetic display (7)\nAs night unfolds, dreams find their way (6)\nStars whisper tales in the cosmic array (5)\nMoonlight weaves a spell, a silent ballet (4)\nSoft breezes carry the night's soft relay (3)\nA tranquil world in slumber, at bay (2)\nNight's hush, in quiet, holds sway (1)\n\n*Remember: The nonet's structure provides a poetic journey, leading the reader to a poignant conclusion.*"

The art is nice though, it's what drew me in initially.\n\nI'm a little late to Eden of Witches, but it seems to be a good fantastical tale with art reminiscent of Witch Hat.

    "selftext": "The rest is just context.\n\nhow does real examiners score my writings? what they want in writing? \n\nTLDR, are they like gpt?\n\n  \nI was getting 22-25 or writings using gpt and some other service in my country for AI checks that rely on gpt via costume prompts. could hardly ever get beyond 27 even using all means possible. extra long writing, no typos, mentioning and paraphrasing everything. not to exaggerate that much but it was pedantic.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Michael from ETS and official practice sets. (links are added). These examples almost break most rules that I had learned through You tube and personal teaching. like:  \nPunctuation\n\n* Punctuation mistakes\n* T2 having 5 paragraphs repeating the same points.\n* **No summary of the reading or relationship with reading or other students.**\n* Having question sentences or surprise sentences with exclamation marks.\n* Numbers instead of writing them down. 200 not two hundred.\n* and the most significant one\n\nIt took me so much from **May 2024** to **January 2025** improving my general English and from then **till now** practicing **TOEFL** so almost 8+9 months (not spending full or even half time on it to be clear). people here and IRL say they just studied ranging from 2 days to 2 months. I improved from the score 70 to being able to consistently get 102-105 from the same pedantic AI. A huge improvement for a non native! for example, my recent self full test score was R29 L29 S22 W24.\n\nIt seems I was and am doing something majorly wrong. Although, my teacher says AI is being generous (my teacher has English literature Masters maybe that's why he is also somewhat stiff).\n\nTook a mock exam and I am currently waiting to get the result. If that's 100<  then another one and if it's again 100<, I will go for the real deal from ETS.\n\n[https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/about/content/writing.html](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/about/content/writing.html)\n\n[https://www.ets.org/pdfs/toefl/toefl-ibt-writing-practice-sets.pdf](https://www.ets.org/pdfs/toefl/toefl-ibt-writing-practice-sets.pdf)  \n\n\n**You can skip reading the rest!** it's just an example.\n\nfor more context: here is my writing in response to some task 1 sample (happened while taking a full exam) and how it was scored.  \nReading:  \nFor many years, a rare species of bat thrived in the city of Seville, Spain, nesting in the hollows (holes) of trees in a large park, which is part of this species' historic habitat. Unfortunately, some years ago invasive birds, rose-ringed parakeets, established themselves in the park. The parakeets have been steadily reducing the park's bat population by attacking and killing the bats and stealing their tree-hollow nests. This raised the question of how to protect the bats, which play an important role in the local ecosystem, for example, by feeding on insect pests. While the situation appears critical, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of the bats in Seville.  \n  \nLiving in Fewer Nests  \nFirst, while the bat population has declined significantly in the park, the remaining bats seem to be adapting to the parakeets. Scientists have discovered a few tree-hollow nests occupied by an unusually large number of bats. The bats appear to be surviving by living in larger numbers in fewer nests, which the parakeets have not invaded. Therefore, the remaining bats may not be in immediate danger of disappearing from the park completely.  \n  \nBat Boxes  \nSecond, conservationists could help restore the bat population by setting up bat boxes‚Äîwooden structures on poles‚Äîin the park. Bat boxes have a specific design feature‚Äîan open bottom with a landing platform‚Äîthat attracts and accommodates bats but makes bat boxes unsuitable as nests for parakeets. Placing bat boxes throughout the park in Seville would provide the bats with nests that the parakeets will not steal, enabling the bats to raise their young and increase their numbers.  \n  \nEradication of Parakeets  \nFinally, the bats could be saved by eradicating the parakeets from the park. Eradication involves killing a species in the areas where it is invasive and has become too numerous. Spanish law allows the eradication of invasive species, so eradication is one way to prevent the parakeets from threatening the bats' survival.\n\n**Lecture**\n\nNarrator: Now, listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.  \n  \nProfessor: Unfortunately, the decline of the bats in Seville is likely to continue despite the arguments made in the reading.  \n  \nFirst, those bats living in larger numbers in fewer nests may not survive for long. The problem is that such cramped living conditions pose a serious risk to the bats' health. You see, bats get tiny organisms called parasites from trees they nest in. However, if the bats spread out, it's harder for parasites to reach them. Parasites transfer from one bat to another when the bats don't have enough space. So when the bats are forced to live close together, parasites transfer from one bat to another much more easily. Sadly, this means that many bats get infected and die.  \n  \nSecond, there's also an issue with the bat box proposal. You see, it's likely to be a slow process for the bats to learn to use bat boxes. In fact, it could take several generations for the bats to start using the boxes, and the bats in Seville could go extinct before they adapt to the boxes. That's because bats have strong preferences about where they like to nest. They prefer hollows in older trees, especially decayed or dead trees. But brand-new boxes are very different from the hollows in older, decayed trees. So unfortunately, the bat boxes won't help prevent the decline of the bats.  \n  \nFinally, it's true that eradicating the invasive parakeets could help save the bats. In fact, the city government of Seville had planned to eradicate the parakeets a few years ago. At that time, a local newspaper published an article explaining the eradication plan. After reading the article, one concerned citizen started an online petition to the mayor of the city, asking him to cancel the eradication plan, and thousands of others supported the petition and signed it as well. Due to public opposition, the government canceled the eradication plan, and it's likely that any future eradication of the parakeets will also be strongly opposed.  \n\n\n**Mine:**  \nBoth the reading and the lecture discuss future of a particular bat species in Seville park of Spain, both stating that these bats are facing this currenct situation due to the invase parakeet birds establishing themselves in the same park. While the reading finds bats survival chance rather high and in an optimistic way the lecturer argues the population decline is likely to continue by ruling out the ways the reading stated.\n\nFirst, the reading points out the bats have already strated to adapt to possible nest stealings by birds by leaving in larger numbers each nest. unfortunately the Lecturer opposes this by explaining how living in larger packs can easiliy transfer parasytes in a cramped environment which are huge threats to bats survivals because infected bats die due to the infection.\n\nSecond, it is proposed by the reading that adding some wooden Bat nest boxes that are only suitable for bats, by having a special platform and shape, can help the remaining bats to preserve their population. In contrast the professor postulates these bats has strong preference for old and dead decaying hollow trees rather than these boxes. Moreover, it can take several generation for bats to learn how to live in those boxes, By then the bats may have already been extinct.\n\nFinally, the Author, knowing the spain law, mentions that the city can start the eradication process of invasive parakeet bird, thus helping the bats. However, the lecturer also knows this fact and the city did try this approach and they faild.¬†¬†¬† Besides, there is a huge public opposition to birds eradication that will likely prevent this initiating this proposed eradication process in the future like it did in the past.\n\n*  Task¬†score :¬†4.25\n* Coherence¬†score :¬†3.75\n* Language Use¬†score :¬†3.75\n* Organization Use¬†score :¬†4\n* **Final Score 24**"

    "selftext": "Chapter CCLIX.\n\nJefferson Household.\n\nSam glanced up at a knock on his door. Before he could respond, Millie hurried over from behind the kitchen counter with a wide excited smile.\n\n\"Oh tha' must be them!\"\n\nShe beamed a wide smile as she opened the door and gave a cheery greeting to someone Sam couldn't see from where he was sitting. He didn't have to wait long to find out though as nine halflings followed Millie into the living room carrying baskets of food stuffs.\n\nFour looked to be about Millie's age while the other five appeared younger versions of them. They were practically built from the same mold as Millie was. Three foot short, a bit of plump where it mattered, and dressed like they walked out of a New Zealand Renaissance faire.\n\nMillie smiled and chatted with them as she introduced the women and girls to Sam.\n\n\"Sam, these are my friends! Melanie, Shannon, Petunia, 'nd Mildred! 'Nd these are their wee lassies! Brigit, Poppy, Irene, 'nd tha twins Sarah 'nd Ethel!\"\n\n\"Uh, nice to meet ya, ladies.\" Sam replied and stood from his chair to shake their hands and welcome them.\n\n\"A pleasure hon! Millie 'ere's told us plenty 'bout ya!\" One of the older halfling women said as she returned the handshake eagerly and excitedly.\n\n\"She has?\" Same asked before starting to go towards the kitchen to offer food and drink, only to be promptly waved away by Millie and a couple of the other halfling women as they took the food stuffs into the kitchen and immediately started preparing for a meal.\n\n\"Oh aye! Couldnae keep 'er talkin' o' anythin' else!\" One of the women replied as she and the other remaining halfling woman looked around and wandered the living room similar to how Millie had first done when she first seen his home.\n\nWhile they gabbed away with Sam about various things, idle gossip from Millie, the collection of knickknacks and doodads around the living room, the other two were in the kitchen with Millie preparing a meal. One of them leaned over towards Millie.\n\n\"Bit old ain'y 'e, Millie?\"\n\nMillie sighed, she knew this would come up, she though as she chopped carrots and other veg for a stew.\n\n\"Aye, 'e is.\"\n\nThe other halfling tsk'd at her words.\n\n\"'Ow old did ya say 'e were?\"\n\n\"Inta 'is fiftieth years.\" Millie replied and braced for what would come next.\n\n\"'Arvest Mother's Teats, Millie! 'E may as well be in tha ground now!\"\n\n\"I ken! But 'e says 'e still 'as plenty o' years ta go!\"\n\nThe other halfling rolled her eyes as she diced some cuts of lamb.\n\n\"All 'umans say tha'. 'Nd ya ken wha' 'appens? They rush off 'nd get themselves killed.\"\n\nMillie wanted to argue. But her friend had a point, she thought as she peered around the counter and could spy Sam chatting with the other two, and the jagged scar across Sam's cheek.\n\n\"Well, t'were hopin' Agatha came along ta take a look. Jus' ta be sure.\"\n\n\"No dear, with magicks tha way they is, folks been needin' her wisdom now more than e'er. Cannae a day pass without some manner o' gout er boils tha' need her know-how. Sent 'er lass along though she did.\"\n\n\"T'weren'y a trouble gettin' 'ere were it?\"\n\n\"Oh no dear! No trouble at all! Some o' those manlin's in green escorted us ta town when we asked!\" The one other halfling cheered as she plucked a pair of chickens.\n\n\"Yeah, after tha' whole business with them hoods, didnae dare travel by ourselves.\" The first halfling replied as she threw the bits of lamb into the pot.\n\n\"Almost turned back when we saws them greenskins! But one o' them 'uman lookin' ones escorted us tha rest o' tha way!\" The second replied as she gutted the chickens.\n\n\"Uneasy it were. But they was gentlefolk they was. Well, tha 'uman lookin' ones were. Tha others were typical greenskins. Dirty, rude... dirty. Their beady lil eyes a leerin' at ya. Right proper those others were though. Polite, clean, charmin'. A wee bit handsome.\"\n\nMillie and the other snickered at her words, causing her face to break out in a blush as she returned to meal prep. Millie glanced around the counter and peered into the living room once more before glancing around.\n\n\"Where'd tha lasses go?\"\n\n-----\n\nSammy exhaled a cloud of blue tinted smoke and did her best to peer through the thickness to gleam what more it could show her. But since that first vision, or trip, or whatever it was, it was nothing but smoke or things she couldn't describe. Or maybe she was just getting too high, she thought as she dabbed the barely smouldering end of her joint in a pool of saliva in her mouth before returning it to it's stash. She fumbled a little bit when the door to her room open.\n\n\"PA?! I told you to kno-\"\n\nShe stopped when she saw five halflings carrying an assortment of goodies stared back at her.\n\n\"Uhm, hi?\"\n\n\"Well hello! You must be Samantha!\" The halfling carrying a mason jar with a cloth top full of what looked like pickles. If pickles wriggled and writhed in the scummy green contents.\n\n\"Eh, Sammy. You must be Millie's friends?\" Sammy replied.\n\n\"Oh tha'd be our mothers! I'm Brigit! 'Nd these are Poppy, Irene, Sarah 'nd Ethel!\" The halfling with the jar said as she introduced each of the halflings in turn.\n\nEach of the girls said their hellos as they were introduced before spreading throughout her room and gazing at her eclectic mixture of Gothic decorations and what was left of her old pretty princess pink things she had yet to get rid of yet.\n\n\"Is tha' hemp I smell?\" The one called Irene asked.\n\nSammy choked and stuttered for a response before Brigit chimed up.\n\n\"Oh fret not Sammy! A bit o' hemp musk is good fer ya!\"\n\n\"You're not against weed?\" Sammy asked even as she inched towards her window and cracked it open to clear the air of smell and smoke.\n\n\"Course not! A great many weeds are good fer ya ifin ya tha know how!\" Sarah replied as she picked up one of Sammy's stuffed plushies. Sammy wasn't entirely sure what to do as the five halfling women oggled her room. Or maybe she was higher than she thought she was.\n\nMust've been the latter, she thought as Brigit placed the jar on Sammy's desk and undid the cloth before reaching in her bare hand and producing a fat wriggling leech. She turned to Sammy with a smile.\n\n\"Nothin' but a wee bit o' bloodlettin' ta clear tha head!\"\n\nIt took far longer for Sammy to finally click with what Brigit had said than she would've liked. She didn't even know what was happening at first until she felt a feeling on her arm like putting one of those plastic suction cups on your skin.\n\nShe blinked as she looked down at the wriggling leech attached to her arm, followed by another, then another. By the time it finally clicked in her head, she had five leeches sucking away on her arm. Yet it still took her a full minute before her body actually reacted to the sensation and what was happening.\n\nSuffice it to say, she screamed.\n\n\n[[First]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/lH4Ee9kFRp)\n[[Prev]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/zNAPnSqE8I)\n[Next]"

The guy was surprised I knew so much about German roach prevention (I told him all about this subreddit lmao) and even commented I laid down the diatomaceous earth perfectly, so he reassured me the chances of having an infestation the level I‚Äôm worried about is next to none.\n\nAnd after all this time, ever since seeing that one dead roach last month - nothing. Nothing on the glue boards, no instars, no droppings, nothing. But that‚Äôs what scares me. The pest control tech confirmed that roach I found was indeed very likely a traveller - but what if there are already hundreds in the walls and they‚Äôre all hiding?\n\nLike I feel‚Ä¶ somewhat safer, but just yesterday I saw the guy again treating an apartment just two units down from mine - he told me as long as I‚Äôm not seeing any signs and I keep up the regimen I have that I should be okay from here on out, but given how often pest control‚Äôs been coming now I still don‚Äôt feel safe enough to start cooking again like I used to and all of my things are still packed up in airtight plastic totes. My apartment feels like a glorified storage facility. I even panicked and threw away a perfectly good toaster because it was one of those ones where you can‚Äôt clean it unless you take the entire thing apart. I sleep with my earbuds in every night because I don‚Äôt want to have to one day call into work to tell them I have to go to the hospital over a cockroach in my ear.\n\nWhat makes me most livid about this is all of this started over two hoarders in our building, just the other day I caught one of them scavenging through MY garbage by the dumpsters for things to salvage. So no matter how many times the place gets treated, I don‚Äôt think the roaches will ever go away.\n\n**TL;DR my unit seems to be completely unaffected while the roaches are continuing to spread rapidly, what doesn‚Äôt help is other tenants aren‚Äôt cooperating so I have a feeling the infestation will be indefinite. Is there anything else I can do beyond this point (since things like Advion and Alpine are illegal in Canada)? I‚Äôve pretty much stopped cooking and have all my things packed in plastic totes, do I have to keep living this way as long as I live here?**"

A secondary red light source from the right side of the frame casts a warm, colored glow onto her arm and hip, adding depth to the lighting. The background foliage is dark and out of focus, emphasizing the subject.\n\nA candid, spontaneous photograph captures a young female with blonde, shoulder-length hair standing in a brightly lit convenience store aisle. She looks toward the camera with a slight smile, her blue eyes visible. She is wearing an extremely tight, form-fitting spaghetti strap dress with a pink, orange, and white tie-dye pattern that accentuates her figure. The material of the dress is thin, revealing that she is not wearing a bra. Her pierced nipples are distinctly visible through the fabric, with the small metal barbells clearly outlined against the pink material. An indentation from a navel piercing can also be seen through the tight dress on her stomach. She wears a gold snake chain necklace, small gold hoop earrings, and a nose ring. A black bag is slung over her shoulder. The background is filled with store shelves stocked with various snack products, and the scene is illuminated by standard overhead fluorescent lighting, creating a casual, unposed atmosphere.\n\n  \nA full-body photograph captures a female with a toned, athletic physique standing on a wet teak swim platform at the stern of a boat. She poses confidently, leaning against a black vertical support post with her left arm raised to grip it. Her body is angled toward the camera, and she gazes directly forward. She is wearing a revealing string bikini with a blue base and a pattern of red and white stars. Her blonde hair is wet and slicked back. The scene is set on a brilliant turquoise ocean under a cloudless blue sky. In the background, a distant coastline features green hills, sandy beaches, and resort buildings, with several small boats scattered across the water. The image is shot from a slightly low angle in harsh, direct midday sunlight, which creates strong highlights on her damp skin and the rippling water surface, alongside sharp, defined shadows. The photograph is characterized by its high clarity and saturated, vivid colors.\n\nA photograph of a young female with windswept, shoulder-length blonde hair, sitting on dark, wet volcanic rocks at a shoreline. She leans back on her right arm, her athletic body angled towards the camera, while she turns her head to fix an intense, direct gaze upon the viewer. She is wearing a minimal brown string bikini with contrasting white trim. The thin fabric of the triangle top is sheer, and her right nipple and areola are clearly visible through the material. A delicate, black ink line-work tattoo of a flower is centered on her sternum, just beneath her exposed breasts. Her toned abdomen features a small gold belly button piercing.\n\nA nighttime photograph captured with a direct on-camera flash features a young female with shoulder-length blonde hair and striking blue eyes. She stands on a balcony, smiling warmly at the camera, her hands raised to push her hair back from her face. Her attire consists of a very low-cut, black cowl-neck top that is backless, revealing the side of her torso and a large tattoo on her ribcage beneath her exposed breast. She wears a sheer, black mini-skirt adorned with a pattern of large pink and yellow flowers. A simple gold bracelet is visible on her left wrist, and she wears a delicate necklace. In the background, the scene is dark, with the unfocused lights of a city creating a bokeh effect against the black sky. The white vertical slats of the balcony railing are prominent in the composition. The direct lighting creates sharp highlights on her skin and hair, separating her clearly from the dark background.\n\nCheers fellas, have a great day!"

Imagine a world where kindness and empathy are our guiding lights, where every action stems from genuine love. It‚Äôs possible, and Jesus shows us how! Whether you‚Äôre familiar with His teachings or exploring them for the first time, His message about love invites us into a profound way of living that enriches our hearts and souls.\n\nOpen your heart and mind as we dive into the depths of what it means to truly love our neighbors as ourselves. It‚Äôs not just about grand gestures; it‚Äôs about everyday kindness and caring for those around us. Let‚Äôs explore how to embody this transformative love and compassion in our daily lives.\n\n\nBible Verse\n\nJohn 13:34 (NIV): ‚ÄúA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.‚Äù\n\n\nMeaning\n\nIn John 13:34, Jesus presents us with a simple yet profound command: to love one another as He has loved us. This love is selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional. Jesus lived out this command through His life, showing compassion to the marginalized, healing the sick, and forgiving the sinner.\n\nThis verse challenges us to reflect on Jesus‚Äôs model of love‚Äîa love not limited by conditions or expectations. He calls us to extend this love to everyone, even those who may be difficult to love. It‚Äôs about embracing a compassionate heart, seeking to understand others, and showing mercy.\n\nJesus‚Äôs teaching pushes us beyond our comfort zones. It‚Äôs easy to love friends and family, but what about strangers or opponents? That‚Äôs where true growth happens, as we align our hearts with the depth of Christ‚Äôs love.\n\n\nActions to Take\n\n- **Practice Active Listening**: Make an effort to truly listen when others speak, offering them your full attention and empathy.\n- **Extend Forgiveness**: Let go of past grievances and extend grace to those who have wronged you, just as Christ has forgiven you.\n- **Serve Others**: Look for opportunities to serve people in your community, whether through volunteering or simple acts of kindness.\n- **Show Appreciation**: Express gratitude to the people in your life who show love and compassion, reinforcing their positive impact.\n- **Cultivate Empathy**: Try to see things from another‚Äôs perspective, fostering a deeper understanding and connection.\n\n\nJournal Prompts\n\n- How have I experienced Jesus‚Äôs love and compassion in my life?\n- In what ways can I better demonstrate love to those around me?\n- Are there any barriers preventing me from fully loving others? How can I overcome them?\n- Reflect on a time you received unexpected kindness. How did it make you feel?\n- What steps can I take this week to embody Jesus‚Äôs teachings on love?\n\n\nPrayer\n\nDear Lord,\n\nThank You for showing me what true love and compassion look like through Your Son, Jesus. Help me to live out His teachings every day. Open my heart to those around me and guide me to love without limits, just as You have loved me. Let Your love shine through my actions and words.\n\nIn Jesus‚Äôs name, Amen.\n\n\nSocial Posts\n\n- ‚ÄúLove one another as I have loved you. Let‚Äôs spread kindness and compassion today! #LoveLikeJesus #Compassion‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúForgiveness and empathy transform hearts. Let‚Äôs embody Christ‚Äôs love in all we do. #FaithInAction #ChristlikeLove‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúJesus‚Äôs love knows no boundaries. How will you extend His love to someone today? #BeTheLight #LoveOneAnother‚Äù\n- ‚Äú‚ÄòA new command I give you: Love one another.‚Äô How powerful is that? #Inspirational #JesusTeaches‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúTransform your world with acts of love and compassion. Little gestures can make a big impact! #LoveInAction‚Äù\n\n\nConclusion\n\nEmbracing Jesus‚Äôs teachings about love and compassion can transform not only our lives but also the lives of those around us. By practicing empathy, forgiveness, and kindness, we reflect Jesus‚Äôs love and become His hands and feet in the world. Let this journey of love grow deeper, affecting every aspect of your life.\n\nContinue exploring and living out Jesus‚Äôs teachings with us at BGodInspired.com, where you‚Äôll find more resources to enrich your spiritual walk. Together, let‚Äôs make the world a better place, one loving action at a time.\n\n- - - - - -\n\nDo you want to know more about what Jesus teaches about ANY topic?

Give me something not romantic. Make it a fight. Have them make up.\n\n- a new start! Give me a charming character from one of my fandom choices start something new! And be supported!\n\n- an ending.

This guide explains how.**\n\nHey everyone,\n\nLike many of you running a small business or working on a lean team, I'm always looking for tools that *actually* pull their weight. NotebookLM has become a quiet mainstay in my stack. It's constantly improving, and the audio \"podcast-style\" overviews and auto-generated videos are brilliant.\n\nBut for SMEs, the real question is: \"How does this help me *day-to-day*?\"\n\nI've seen a lot of guides, so I put together a practical cheatsheet based on how we *really* use it. No hype, just use cases that actually move the needle.\n\n# Where NotebookLM Shines for Small Businesses (The \"Aha!\" Moments)\n\nThis is where it goes from \"cool tool\" to \"core tool.\"\n\n* **SOPs & Onboarding:** Upload your policies, handbooks, and playbooks.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Turn my SOPs into a week-one checklist for a new sales rep.\"\n   * **Prompt:** \"Create 10 quiz questions based on the employee handbook.\"\n   * **Prompt:** \"Generate a 10-minute audio overview of our core company values and policies for new hires to listen to on their commute.\"\n* **Research ‚Üí Decisions:** Pull in market reports, competitor PDFs, and industry web pages.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Summarize these reports into a 1-page brief for non-technical execs. Include 3 opportunities, 3 risks, and 2 next steps. Provide citations.\"\n* **Sales & Proposals:** Combine product sheets, case studies, and internal pricing docs.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Using the 'Gold Package' product sheet and the 'Acme Corp' case study, draft a tailored proposal for a new client in the logistics industry.\"\n   * **Prompt:** \"Generate an objection-handling FAQ based on our internal sales training docs.\"\n* **Content Repurposing:** Feed it interview transcripts, blog posts, and slide decks.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Turn this 1-hour interview transcript into a structured blog post outline.\"\n   * **Prompt:** \"Generate 5 social media captions and a 2-minute summary video from this article.\"\n* **Vendor/Tool Comparisons:** Load in those 30-page RFP responses and vendor PDFs.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Compare Vendor A, Vendor B, and Vendor C. Create a table with cost, key features, and implementation risk.\"\n* **Customer Insight Packs:** Summarize support tickets, NPS comments, or feedback forms.\n   * **Prompt:** \"Analyze these 50 customer comments. What are the top 3 themes? Rank them by urgency and suggest 1 fix for each, based on our support SOPs.\"\n\n# How to Be a Top 1% NotebookLM User (Go Beyond the Basics)\n\nThis is what changed the game for me. Don't treat it like a search box. Treat it like a thinking partner or a virtual analyst.\n\n1. **Mindset Shift: It's a Collaborator, Not a Vending Machine.** The magic is in *prompt chaining*. Don't ask one-off questions. Have a conversation.\n   * **Bad:** \"Summarize this.\"\n   * **Good (a chained conversation):**\n      1. \"Summarize the key themes from these customer interviews.\"\n      2. \"Based on those themes, what are the top 3 complaints?\"\n      3. \"For each complaint, cross-reference my 'Product Manuals' source to identify the likely root cause.\"\n      4. \"Now, draft a 1-page brief for the product team outlining these issues, their root causes (with citations), and suggest 3 action items.\"\n2. **Source Curation is Everything (Garbage In, Garbage Out).** The quality of your output is 100% dependent on the quality of your input sources.\n   * **Pro-Tip:** Keep your notebooks focused. Don't dump 100 random files in. Create a \"Company Brand Voice\" notebook, a \"Product Specs\" notebook, and a \"Project Phoenix\" notebook. You can't build a good house on a messy foundation.\n   * **Use the \"Discover Sources\" feature** to actively find and *vet* new information, not just passively accept what you've already uploaded.\n3. **Studio Outputs are Building Blocks.** A 1% user doesn't just generate one output. They use outputs as *inputs* for the next step.\n   * **Example:**\n      1. Generate a \"Report\" on market trends.\n      2. Create a \"Mind Map\" from that report to visualize connections.\n      3. Generate an \"Audio Overview\" of the *report* for your team.\n      4. Create \"Flashcards\" for the key stats from the report to prep for a meeting.\n\n# Pro-Tips: Getting Amazing Audio & Video Overviews\n\nThis is my favorite feature. Here‚Äôs how to get podcast-quality results.\n\n1. **Best Practice: Start with a Good Source.** An audio overview of a 50-page unformatted text dump will be messy. An overview of a well-structured document (clear headings, concise paragraphs) will be clean and focused. *If the audio is confusing, go back and clean up your source document first.*\n2. **Pro-Tip: Guide the Audience and Tone.** Don't just click \"generate.\" Tell it *who* it's for.\n   * `\"Create an audio overview of this report for a new sales rep who has never seen it.\"`\n   * `\"Generate a video overview with an upbeat, encouraging tone for the marketing team.\"`\n   * `\"Create a 5-minute audio overview that focuses only on the key action items and deadlines from this project plan.\"`\n3. **Advanced Tip: Create a \"Script\" Source First.** This is the #1 hack. Don't generate audio from a 50-page report.\n   * **Step 1:** Ask NotebookLM, `\"Write a 3-page script summarizing this 50-page report, using clear, conversational language.\"`\n   * **Step 2:** Save that script.\n   * **Step 3:** Add *that script* as a new source in your notebook.\n   * **Step 4:** Generate your Audio/Video Overview from the *script*, not the original report. You now have full control over the final output.\n\n# What I Like Most (The \"Why This, Not That\")\n\n* **It works** ***only*** **from your sources.** This is huge. It's not hallucinating or pulling random facts from the web (unless you explicitly ask it to with \"Discover Sources\").\n* **Citations you can check.** Every answer is linked back to your original document. This builds trust and makes it verifiable.\n* **Studio Outputs:** Reports, Mind Maps, Audio, Video, Flashcards... all from one set of sources.\n* **Shareable outputs:** The lightweight, shareable links mean my team will *actually* read/watch the summaries.\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* **Mixing unrelated topics in one notebook.** Keep them focused!\n* **Uploading poor-quality, image-only PDFs.** It needs text to read.\n* **Treating outputs as final.** It's an AI *partner*. Always review, refine, and add your human expertise before sharing.\n\nHope this practical guide helps you and your team!\n\nWant more great prompting inspiration?

    "selftext": "I know everyone's thinking about v6 now, but if you're still on v4 and haven't made the jump to v5 yet, I wanted to share our migration experience. We migrated BrainGrid's entire AI agent system (14 tools, complex streaming) from v4.3.16 to v5.0.0-beta.25 and learned some things that might save you time.\n\n**What motivated our migration from v4 to v5:**\n\n* Tool streaming - users can see what agents are doing in real-time\n* Provider options for cache control - save $$ on API costs\n\n# The Breaking Changes That Mattered\n\n**1. Tool definitions:** `parameters` **‚Üí** `inputSchema`\n\nEvery tool needed updating:\n\n    // v4\n    const tool = tool({\n      parameters: z.object({ url: z.string() }),\n      execute: async args => { /* ... */ }\n    });\n    \n    // v5\n    const tool = tool({\n      inputSchema: z.object({ url: z.string() }),  // üëà renamed\n      execute: async args => { /* ... */ }\n    });\n\nAlso: `chunk.args` became `chunk.input` and `maxTokens` became `maxOutputTokens`.\n\n**2. Message content type changes**\n\nThis exposed a real bug in our token calculator:\n\n    // This assumed content was always a string (it's not in v5)\n    function calculateTokens(message: AIMessage): number {\n      const content = message.content as string; // üö® Crashes on arrays\n      return tokenizer.encode(content).length;\n    }\n\nIn v5, content can be:\n\n* A string: `\"Hello\"`\n* An array: `[{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello' }, { type: 'image', image: '...' }]`\n* Complex objects\n\nWe had been undercounting tokens for months.\n\n**3. Control flow:** `maxSteps` **‚Üí** `stopWhen`\n\nThis confused us initially:\n\n    // v4\n    maxSteps: 25  // \"Stop at or before 25 steps\"\n    \n    // v5\n    stopWhen: stepCountIs(25)  // \"Run exactly 25 steps\"\n\n`stepCountIs(n)` behaves more like `minSteps` than `maxSteps`. But it's actually more powerful - you can now stop on specific conditions:\n\n    stopWhen: [\n      stepCountIs(5),\n      hasToolCall('generate_questions')  // Stop immediately when this tool is called\n    ]\n\nWe previously had to prompt-engineer agents to stop after certain tools. Now it's built-in.\n\n# What We Gained\n\n**Tool streaming** \\- The big win. Users see tool cards appear instantly:\n\n    if (chunk.type === 'tool-call') {\n      setTemporaryStreamMessage(prev => [\n        ...prev,\n        {\n          type: 'tool_call',\n          tool_call: {\n            id: chunk.toolCallId,\n            name: chunk.toolName,\n            arguments: chunk.input,\n            loading: true  // Spinner shows immediately\n          }\n        }\n      ]);\n    }\n\n**Provider options** \\- Cache control on tool definitions:\n\n    const tool = tool({\n      inputSchema: z.object({ /* ... */ }),\n      providerOptions: {\n        anthropic: {\n          cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' }  // Cache this definition\n        }\n      },\n      execute: async args => { /* ... */ }\n    });\n\nFor complex tools, this saved us thousands of tokens per request.\n\n**Stricter types** \\- Caught bugs like accidentally sending tool names instead of message content. v4 accepted it silently; v5 caught it at compile time.\n\n# Lessons We Learned\n\n1. **Pin your beta versions**: `\"ai\": \"5.0.0-beta.25\"` not `\"^5.0.0-beta.25\"` \\- beta versions can have breaking changes between releases\n2. **Read the source, not just the docs**: Migration guides show the happy path, but real apps have edge cases. The SDK source code is surprisingly readable.\n3. **Test with production-like scenarios**: Our unit tests passed, but we almost missed the `maxSteps` behavioral change. Always run manual tests before shipping.\n4. **Budget time for edge cases**: It took a couple of days instead of an afternoon. Simple changes add up when you have complex agent systems.\n5. **Document everything**: Keep a migration log. This blog post started as those notes.\n\n# Was It Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOur users get instant feedback when agents work. Infrastructure costs dropped noticeably. Our code is more type-safe and maintainable.\n\nYes, it took a couple of days instead of an afternoon. Yes, we discovered bugs we didn't know existed. Yes, we questioned our sanity around the second day. But that's engineering‚Äîwe migrated because our users deserved better, our infrastructure demanded it, and the beta version had exactly what we needed.\n\nWe wrote up the full migration with all the code examples, edge cases, and gotchas here: [https://braingrid.ai/blog/migrating-to-ai-sdk-v5](https://braingrid.ai/blog/migrating-to-ai-sdk-v5)\n\n**Has anyone else migrated to v5?

When teams perform well, customers notice. Innovation increases. Work feels meaningful.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the real challenge: performance does not improve through pressure alone. It improves when people know what to do, why it matters, and how they can get better every day.\n\n# Feedback Culture Drives Real Progress\n\nA healthy [feedback culture](https://gwork.io/blog/building-a-strong-feedback-culture-at-work/) is the backbone of great performance. People learn faster when feedback is timely, specific, and positive in its intent. They feel supported, not judged.\n\nWhen feedback becomes normal, teams:\n\n* Solve problems before they escalate\n* Maintain strong alignment\n* Build trust and accountability\n* Celebrate wins more often\n\nIt feels easier to excel when everyone communicates honestly and respectfully.\n\n# 360¬∞ Surveys Offer a Full Picture\n\nMany organizations now use **360¬∞ surveys** to understand how team members impact each other. These surveys collect feedback from peers, managers, and direct reports. The goal is simple: help every person grow from multiple perspectives.\n\nThis well-rounded insight leads to:\n\n* Better self-awareness\n* Improved collaboration\n* Stronger leadership skills\n\nPeople appreciate feedback more when it feels fair and balanced.\n\n# Habit Adoption Makes Performance Stick\n\nFeedback and insights only matter when they turn into consistent actions. [Habit adoption ](https://gwork.io/blog/case-study-30-improvement-in-team-productivity/)turns one-time improvement into lasting performance gains.\n\nSmall habits create big results:\n\n* Ask for quick input after completing a task\n* Share recognition when work is well done\n* Follow up with team members after feedback\n\nThese micro-behaviors build resilience and confidence. The team learns to adapt quickly and take ownership of success.\n\n# How GWork Helps Teams Perform at Their Best\n\n[GWork](https://gwork.io/) offers simple tools that help teams build the habits that support high performance. With built-in feedback prompts, easy check-ins, and automated 360¬∞ surveys, feedback becomes a natural part of everyday work.\n\nLeaders get real insights. Employees feel seen and supported. Teams grow stronger over time.\n\nGWork turns good intentions into real results.\n\n# Strong Performance Is a Team Sport\n\nWhen teams share feedback often and shape better habits together, performance rises ‚Äî and it stays high.\n\nWant to help your team thrive?\n\nüëâ **Boost team performance with GWork.** [Book your demo today](https://gwork.io/book-demo/)**!**"

    "selftext": "A strong [feedback culture](https://gwork.io/blog/building-a-strong-feedback-culture-at-work/) helps people grow faster. It keeps teams aligned. It builds trust. When people give and receive feedback often, they feel valued. They understand what works well and what needs improvement. Teams adapt quicker. Results improve.\n\nMany companies talk about feedback, but only a few make it a habit. Real feedback culture shows up in day-to-day actions. Leaders ask for input. Employees speak openly. Everyone feels safe to share ideas. This is where growth starts.\n\n# Why Feedback Culture Matters\n\nFeedback culture connects individual efforts to team goals. Clear and timely feedback removes confusion. People don‚Äôt guess. They take action with confidence.\n\nTeams that embrace feedback:\n\n* Spot problems early\n* Improve skills faster\n* Strengthen communication\n* Build a sense of ownership\n* Boost performance consistently\n\nIt feels simple. But it requires practice.\n\n# From Annual Reviews to Continuous Input\n\nAnnual reviews are too slow for today‚Äôs pace. Teams need insights when work happens. That‚Äôs why more companies shift to ongoing feedback and 360¬∞ surveys. These surveys help people understand how others experience their work. Peers, managers, and direct reports share helpful perspectives. This creates balanced growth.\n\nRegular feedback moments turn into routines. These routines become habits. And habits shape culture.\n\n# Habit Adoption Is the Real Game-Changer\n\nTools alone do not build culture. Habits do.\n\nA strong feedback culture encourages small daily actions:\n\n* Ask for one suggestion after a meeting\n* Give quick praise when something goes well\n* Offer guidance before issues escalate\n\nThese tiny steps improve performance over time. Everyone learns. Everyone grows together.\n\n# How GWork Helps Teams Grow a True Feedback Culture\n\n[GWork](https://gwork.io/) makes feedback simple and natural. Teams use quick check-ins, guided feedback prompts, and 360¬∞ surveys to support their daily work. Leaders get clear insights. Employees feel safe to share honest opinions. Feedback becomes a normal part of work instead of a stressful event.\n\nGWork helps teams form positive feedback habits that stick. Better habits lead to stronger teams and higher performance.\n\n# Build a Culture Where Everyone Thrives\n\nFeedback culture is not a project. It is a way of working. When a team learns to talk openly and act on feedback, success follows.\n\nReady to level up your team performance with better habits?\n\nüëâ **Start building a healthy feedback culture today with GWork.** [Book your demo now](https://gwork.io/book-demo/)**!**"

Today things look like everything can be done with some LLM calls and tools attached to it.\n\n- LLM models got better at reasoning\n- LLM models got better with working with longer context\n- LLM models got better at formatting outputs\n- Agent tooling is 10x easier because of this\n\nFor example, in the past, to build a basic SEO keyword researcher agentic workflow I needed to work with this architecture, (will try to describe since images are not allowed)\n\nIt‚Äôs basicly a flow that starts with Keyword ‚Üí A. SEO Analyst: (Analyze results, extract articles, extract intent.) B. Researcher: (Identify good content, Identify Bad content, Find OG data to make better articles). C. Writer: (Use Good Examples, Writing Style & Format, Generate Article). Then there is a loop where this goes to an Editor that analyzes the article. If it does not approve the content it generates feedback and goes back to the Writer, or if it‚Äôs perfect it creates the final output and then a Human can review. So basicly there are a few different agents that I needed to separately handle in order to make this research agent work.\n\nThese days this is collapsing to be only one Agent that uses a lot of tools, and a very long prompt. I still require a lot of debugging but it happens vertically, where i check things like:\n\n- Tool executions\n- Authentication\n- Human in the loop approvals\n- How outputs are being formatted\n- Accuracy/ other types of metrics\n\nI don‚Äôt build the whole infra manually, I use Vellum AI for that. And for what is worth I think this will become 100x easier, as we start using better models and/or fine-tuning our own ones.\n\nAre you seeing this on your end too? Are your agents becoming simpler to build/manage?"

It did a good job of structuring the request. But ChatGPT itself is not the image step here. I used its wording for the next two systems to keep it fair.\n\n**Step 2:** [Midjourney](http://midjourney.com) Beautiful images. But not my face. Style drifted toward polished fashion. Eyes were sharp, skin a bit too perfect. I could push settings and seeds. Still looked like a great stranger. Time spent: lots of iterations.\n\n**Step 3: a personal AI photographer** Halfway through I tried [looktara.com](http://looktara.com). You upload 30 solo photos once. It trains a private model of you in about 10 minutes. Then you can create unlimited solo photos that still look like a clean phone shot. It is made by a LinkedIn creators community for daily posters. Private. Deletable. No group composites.\n\n**Likeness scorecard (my opinion)** Midjourney: looks great, not me. Personal AI photographer: looks like me, usable daily.\n\n**Speed and effort** Midjourney: fast renders, slow iteration for identity. Personal AI photographer: setup once, then seconds per photo.\n\n**Quality checks I used** keep one background per week soft light tight crop for explainers wider crop for stories if an image felt uncanny I deleted it\n\n**Where each shines** ChatGPT: writes clear prompts and guardrails. Midjourney: incredible for style, scenes, and concepts. Personal AI photographer: best when the goal is your face, on schedule.\n\n**30 day results after switching my posts to face first** profile visits up DMs warmer two small deals in week three comments started using the word \"saw\" (\"saw you on that pricing post\")\n\n**Why this mattered for personal branding** People remember people. Faces create recall. Recall creates replies. Replies open work.\n\n**Tiny SEO terms I searched and used once** AI headshot for LinkedIn best AI photo generator personal branding photos Midjourney portrait\n\n**Ethics and safety I follow** no fake locations no body edits no celebrity look alikes say it is AI if asked still hire photographers for real events export monthly and clean up old sets\n\n**Copy my mini workflow** post idea first photo vibe second generate 3 options pick 1 ship log comments that say see or recognize\n\nIf you want my intake list of 30 source photos and the prompt lines, comment prompts and I will paste.

Now I analyze competitors‚Äô sites with AI to see what works and steal what‚Äôs useful. I mostly build sites for SEO, not design.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†We started out building cheap, fast AI websites for startups. Now we‚Äôre developing SaaS tools ‚Äî partnered with Steven Walters from the Streets App. We made Prompt Flyers, an AI flyer generator, and PartyPost, a text-to-screen app for live events.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†That‚Äôs wild. I play with Lovable a lot ‚Äî built my ‚ÄúFlorida Fund Finder,‚Äù then my AI-SEO site. I‚Äôm obsessed with analyzing sites through Perplexity, Comet, and ChatGPT. I use them like a lab.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†I code in Cursor and Claude Code, but I‚Äôm more of a prompt engineer. My strength is knowing how to talk to LLMs.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Exactly. I build prompts that turn hours of work into seconds. After I research a client, I tell GPT to ‚Äúcreate a prompt to replicate this.‚Äù My system: Perplexity for fact-checking, ChatGPT for writing, Comet for SEO context.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†I love how OpenAI‚Äôs ecosystem is becoming ‚ÄúApple-like.‚Äù Everything syncs perfectly.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Yeah. But Perplexity‚Äôs still best for SEO fact checks. I highlight text, hit ‚ÄúSearch Perplexity,‚Äù and instantly see if something‚Äôs false. I‚Äôm also testing Atlas browser, though it drives me crazy when it doesn‚Äôt save searches.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†ChatGPT memory is underrated. Most people never use it, but it‚Äôs powerful when you feed it your world.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†I use it constantly. It knows my degree, my clients, everything. I once asked it to act like a psychiatrist and analyze me ‚Äî nailed it. Then I asked what my education level was. It got that right too.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†You really test it.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†I trust GPT more than most doctors. It knows my context. I told it to estimate how much AI boosts my productivity ‚Äî it said 600‚Äì1,000%. And it‚Äôs right. I can generate a 2,500-word EEAT blog post, LinkedIn caption, podcast script, and image prompt in minutes.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†That‚Äôs wild productivity.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†My best skill is pushing past GPT‚Äôs first answer. Most people accept whatever it spits out. I refine, cross-check with Perplexity and Gemini, and iterate until it‚Äôs actually correct. That‚Äôs prompt engineering in a nutshell.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†You learn more doing that than any class.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Exactly. I learned more in two years with ChatGPT than from college.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†College teaches communication, but not building.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Right. I tell clients ‚Äî you can learn anything over a weekend now. I built my HypedSEO site on Lovable. Ran it through Google PageSpeed Insights: 94 mobile, 100 desktop, 100 SEO, 100 accessibility. Better than Wix or WordPress.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†Lovable and [V0.dev](http://V0.dev) are basically React/Next.js under the hood ‚Äî fast, light, customizable.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†That‚Äôs why I use them. My next step is figuring out CMS management or exporting to WordPress.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†You could build your own lightweight CMS.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†True. But for now, I just keep automating. Every week I measure how much better I‚Äôve gotten at AI. ChatGPT even tells me I‚Äôve become less sarcastic and more efficient.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†Using voice with GPT is the biggest upgrade. Talking gives it context.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Yes ‚Äî I tell everyone: talk, don‚Äôt type. Mark Cuban said the same ‚Äî ‚Äúclick the mic and talk for a minute.‚Äù That‚Äôs how you get good context.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†Most people, even college students, don‚Äôt get that. They still treat AI like Google.\n\n\n\n**Jason:**¬†Totally. They‚Äôre afraid of ‚Äúcheating.‚Äù I tell them ‚Äî using AI is just smart note-taking. It‚Äôs the calculator moment all over again.\n\n\n\n**Griffin:**¬†Same here. I use AI for 99% of my school assignments. Professors ask if I used it, I say yes, show them how, and they‚Äôre impressed.\n\n"

Is there any other context clues that I am missing, or maybe the genre would make the listener expect an outlaw tale?..\n\nThe reason this interests me is that this helps frame the rest of the story, for example, Molly/Jenny and her betrayal. Is that a situation where she was involved with a robber, but seems to think he crossed the line by attacking an official, or is this a case of her lover/husband suddenly turning up after robbing a man out of nowhere?.."

    "selftext": "Professional's Protocol for Access and Operation\n\nMastering Your Tools\n\nThroughout this curriculum, we have focused on the strategies and psychologies required to navigate the market's hostile environment. Now, we turn our attention to the physical tools of your new trade: the MEFAI platform itself.\n\nAn amateur trader blames their tools for their failures. A professional achieves absolute, uncompromising mastery over them. They understand every function, every nuance, and every security protocol. This chapter is your operational manual. It is not a simple \"how to\" guide; it is a professional protocol for interacting with our platform with security, efficiency, and clarity.\n\nWe have built the MEFAI platform on a foundation of decentralization and user sovereignty. We do not operate like a traditional Web2 company. We do not hold your passwords, we do not control your accounts. Understanding this philosophy is the first step to using the platform correctly. Pay close attention. This is the practical foundation upon which your new trading career will be built.\n\n# [](https://mefai.gitbook.io/mefai-docs/other/platform-guide-how-to-use-the-platform#part-1-the-principle-of-decentralized-access-your-wallet-is-your-only-key)\n\n# Part 1: The Principle of Decentralized Access  Your Wallet is Your Only Key\n\nThe first and most fundamental difference you will notice is the absence of a \"Username/Password\" login. This is by design. MEFAI operates on a Web3 principle: your crypto wallet is your key.\n\n* The Concept: Connecting your wallet is the Web3 equivalent of \"logging in.\" Your unique wallet address is your identifier. We do not need your name, your email, or any other personal information to grant you access. This is a system built on privacy and user control.\n* The Security: This model is inherently more secure. There are no massive databases of user passwords on our servers for hackers to target. We never have custody of your credentials. Your security is in your hands, protected by the cryptography of your personal wallet.\n* The Supported Wallets: The MEFAI platform is designed for broad accessibility. You can connect using the most popular browser based wallets directly, including,\n   * MetaMask\n   * Coinbase Wallet\n   * Bitget Wallet\n   * Fortmatic Furthermore, \n   * by selecting the **WalletConnect** option, you can connect to dozens of other mobile and hardware wallets. WalletConnect acts as a secure bridge, ensuring wide ranging compatibility.\n\n# [](https://mefai.gitbook.io/mefai-docs/other/platform-guide-how-to-use-the-platform#part-2-the-connection-protocol-a-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-access)\n\n# Part 2: The Connection Protocol A Step by Step Guide to Flawless Access\n\nTo ensure a seamless and secure connection, you must follow a deliberate, professional protocol. Do not frantically click. Act with precision.\n\nStep 1: Prepare Your Wallet Before you even visit the MEFAI platform, your first action is to open and unlock your chosen crypto wallet. Whether it's the MetaMask browser extension or your mobile wallet app, ensure it is active and you are logged in. This ensures that your browser or phone has an active, ready connection to the blockchain, which is necessary for the platform to communicate with your wallet.\n\nStep 2: Initiate the Connection Navigate to the MEFAI platform. Click on the \"Connect Wallet\" button. You will be presented with a list of available wallets.\n\nStep 3: Select Your Gateway Choose the correct wallet from the list. If your wallet is not listed directly, choose WalletConnect to initiate the connection via QR code or mobile prompt.\n\nStep 4: The Security Handshake (Granting Permission) Your wallet will now prompt you with a permission request. This is the most critical security moment. You must read what it is asking. Notice what our platform requests:\n\n* `View the addresses of your permitted accounts.`\n\nNotice what it does NOT ask for,\n\n* It does NOT ask for permission to spend your funds.\n* It does NOT ask you to sign a transaction or interact with a smart contract.\n\nThe only permission requested is to see your public address, which is necessary to verify your identity and unlock your specific access tier. Accepting this request is secure and standard practice. This minimalist approach to permissions is a cornerstone of our commitment to your security.\n\nStep 5: Confirmation and Access Once you approve the connection, the platform will recognize your address and your corresponding user tier will be unlocked: Public, Starter, Pro, or Prime. You now have access to the platform.\n\n# [](https://mefai.gitbook.io/mefai-docs/other/platform-guide-how-to-use-the-platform#part-3-troubleshooting-doctrine-solving-common-connection-issues)\n\n# Part 3: Troubleshooting Doctrine ‚Äì Solving Common Connection Issues\n\nWhile our system is robust, issues can occasionally arise, most often due to local browser or wallet states. Follow this doctrine to resolve them.\n\n* Protocol 1: The Deliberate Re attempt. If a connection fails, do not start clicking everything in sight. This often makes things worse. Calmly close the connection pop up. Double check that your wallet is unlocked. Then, initiate the connection process again, slowly and deliberately.\n* Protocol 2: The Cache Cleanse. The most common cause of persistent connection issues is old or corrupted data stored in your browser's cache. Before escalating the issue, you must perform a \"cache cleanse.\" Clear your browser's cache and cookies, close the browser completely, reopen it, and then try the connection protocol again from the beginning. This solves over 90% of user side issues.\n* Protocol 3: The Final Escalation. If, and only if, you have followed Protocols 1 and 2 multiple times without success, should you contact the support team for assistance.\n\n# [](https://mefai.gitbook.io/mefai-docs/other/platform-guide-how-to-use-the-platform#part-4-mobile-operations-the-pwa-advantage)\n\n# Part 4: Mobile Operations  The PWA Advantage\n\nThe MEFAI platform is fully accessible on mobile devices. For the optimal experience, we have built it as a Progressive Web App.\n\n* What is a PWA? A PWA is a website that has the functionality of a native mobile application. You do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play.\n* How to \"Install\" It: While on the MEFAI website on your mobile browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android), you can use the \"Share\" menu and select \"Add to Home Screen.\" This will place a MEFAI icon on your phone's home screen, just like a regular app.\n* The Benefits:\n   1. Speed: You now have one-tap access to the platform.\n   2. Notifications: Installing the PWA is the most reliable way to receive the real-time trade signal notifications that are a core part of the MEFAI experience.\n* Mobile Connection Protocol: Just as with desktop, you must first ensure you are logged into your primary mobile wallet app (e.g., MetaMask Mobile, Trust Wallet) before attempting to connect via the PWA.\n\n# [](https://mefai.gitbook.io/mefai-docs/other/platform-guide-how-to-use-the-platform#part-5-the-referral-system-protocol)\n\n# Part 5: The Referral System Protocol\n\nThe MEFAI platform includes a referral system designed to reward users for bringing new operators into our ecosystem.\n\n* Accessibility: You can access and copy your unique referral link from your account page at any time. You do not need to be a paying subscriber to have a referral link.\n* Mechanism: When a new user navigates to our site using your link, a cookie is placed in their browser. They will see special \"Purchase with Referral\" buttons on our subscription page. When they subscribe through these buttons, the system automatically attributes the referral to your account.\n\nConclusion: Mastery of Your Environment\n\nYour trading platform is your cockpit. It is your command center. An amateur fumbles with the controls, is confused by errors, and operates in a state of perpetual uncertainty. A professional achieves total mastery of their environment. They know every button, every function, and every protocol.\n\nThis guide is your first step toward that mastery. By understanding the principles of our decentralized platform, internalizing the secure connection protocols, and knowing how to troubleshoot common issues, you are building the foundation of a disciplined and professional operational workflow."

    "selftext": "Organizations today operate in environments defined by rapid change, global competition, and increasing employee expectations. To stay ahead, companies must continually learn, adapt, and innovate. One of the most powerful yet often overlooked drivers of that adaptability is a strong [feedback culture](https://gwork.io/blog/building-a-strong-feedback-culture-at-work/). When feedback is woven into the daily fabric of work - not reserved for annual performance reviews - individuals grow faster, relationships strengthen, and collective success becomes the norm.\n\nA feedback culture goes far deeper than occasional praise or correction. It is an intentional environment where communication is open, learning is prioritized, and everyone feels empowered to speak up. Building such a culture requires leadership commitment, shared responsibility, and a mindset shift that views feedback not as evaluation, but as an opportunity for improvement.\n\n# What Is a Feedback Culture?\n\nA feedback culture is an organizational environment where employees and leaders continuously exchange constructive feedback that promotes development, trust, and alignment. Rather than waiting for issues to escalate, feedback is timely, transparent, and future-focused.\n\nKey characteristics of a strong feedback culture include:\n\n* **Psychological safety**: Employees trust they can express opinions or concerns without fear of punishment or embarrassment.\n* **Growth mindset**: Mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities.\n* **Frequent communication**: Check-ins are consistent, not tied only to major milestones.\n* **Balanced feedback**: Strengths are celebrated while opportunities for growth are clearly addressed.\n* **Mutual responsibility**: Everyone - not only managers - participates in giving and receiving feedback.\n\nIn this kind of environment, feedback becomes a constructive habit rather than a stressful event.\n\n# Why a Feedback Culture Matters More Than Ever\n\nResearch shows that employees crave meaningful feedback. Organizations that excel at feedback experience benefits across performance, engagement, and retention.\n\n**Here‚Äôs why it matters:**\n\n# ‚úÖ Drives Better Performance\n\nPerformance improves when expectations are clear and progress is regularly evaluated. Employees who understand what they are doing well - and where to improve - can take fast, informed action. Teams execute more efficiently and adapt quickly when priorities shift.\n\n# ‚úÖ Strengthens Employee Engagement\n\nPeople feel valued when their voices are heard. Engagement increases when employees receive guidance that supports their development instead of being left to guess how they‚Äôre doing.\n\n# ‚úÖ Encourages Innovation\n\nIdeas flourish in an environment where diverse perspectives are welcomed. Employees who know feedback is a safe and normal part of communication are more likely to propose new solutions and challenge outdated assumptions.\n\n# ‚úÖ Improves Workplace Relationships\n\nHonest, respectful conversation builds trust. Misunderstandings are resolved quickly when feedback is frequent and two-sided.\n\n# ‚úÖ Helps Retain Top Talent\n\nHigh-performing employees want continuous development. A feedback-rich environment shows the organization is invested in their growth and career progression.\n\nUltimately, a strong feedback culture becomes a **competitive advantage** \\- one that boosts both morale and business results.\n\n# The Role of Leaders in Creating a Feedback Culture\n\nLeadership commitment is the single most important factor in establishing a healthy feedback environment. Leaders must not only give effective feedback - they must welcome it themselves. When leaders show vulnerability, acknowledge mistakes, and act on input, employees learn that feedback is valued and safe.\n\nLeaders can set the tone by:\n\n* **Modeling curiosity** and asking for feedback regularly\n* Providing **clear expectations** and coaching toward success\n* **Recognizing achievements** frequently and specifically\n* Encouraging honest conversations without repercussions\n* Responding with appreciation instead of defensiveness\n\nWhen leaders embrace feedback as a tool for growth, teams follow their example. Culture change starts at the top - but it doesn‚Äôt end there.\n\n# How Employees Contribute to Feedback Culture\n\nWhile leadership is critical, a feedback culture can only thrive when everyone participates. Employees play an active role by staying open-minded, asking questions, and taking ownership of their development.\n\nEmployees can strengthen feedback culture by:\n\n* Requesting feedback proactively\n* Accepting both praise and critique with an open perspective\n* Reflecting on feedback and implementing improvements\n* Expressing appreciation when others contribute insights\n* Sharing observations respectfully to help colleagues grow\n\nFeedback is a partnership - one that requires trust, empathy, and professionalism.\n\n# Seven Practical Strategies to Strengthen Feedback Culture\n\nBuilding a feedback-driven organization doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. Below are actionable steps that leaders and HR teams can implement to encourage ongoing communication and development.\n\n# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make Feedback Regular and Routine\n\nShort, informal check-ins create consistent opportunities for reflection and adjustment. Managers might schedule weekly one-on-ones or use ‚Äúmicro-feedback‚Äù moments throughout the week.\n\n# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Train Staff on How to Give and Receive Feedback\n\nNot everyone naturally knows how to communicate feedback constructively. Teaching frameworks such as **SBI (Situation ‚Äì Behavior ‚Äì Impact)** or **Feedforward** equips employees with practical tools to support positive conversations.\n\n# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Normalize Asking for Feedback\n\nEmployees should feel empowered to take ownership of their progress. Simple prompts like:\n\n* ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one thing I could do better next week?‚Äù\n* ‚ÄúHow did my contribution support the team‚Äôs goals?‚Äù\n\ncan shift culture dramatically over time.\n\n# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Foster Psychological Safety\n\nEncourage sharing of opinions, challenges, and new ideas without judgment. When people trust they won‚Äôt be penalized for speaking up, they will engage more deeply and communicate more openly.\n\n# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Balance Praise with Constructive Suggestions\n\nPositive feedback builds confidence and reinforces strengths. Constructive guidance ensures learning continues. A balanced approach drives motivation and improvement simultaneously.\n\n# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage Technology and Systems\n\nPerformance management tools, feedback platforms, and anonymous input options can support transparency and ensure issues are addressed early.\n\n# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Celebrate Learning and Progress\n\nRecognizing growth - not just outcomes - reduces anxiety around feedback and reinforces a culture of continuous improvement.\n\n# Overcoming Common Barriers to Feedback Culture\n\nEven with good intentions, organizations may struggle with resistance or discomfort. It‚Äôs important to address common challenges:\n\n* **Fear of conflict** \\- Provide scripts and role-play practice\n* **Cultural differences** \\- Adapt communication styles for diverse teams\n* **Lack of time** \\- Integrate feedback into already existing workflows\n* **Defensiveness** \\- Reinforce the purpose as growth, not criticism\n\nOrganizations that acknowledge and address these barriers create a smoother path toward lasting transformation.\n\n# Feedback Culture Isn‚Äôt a Tool - It‚Äôs a Mindset\n\nEstablishing a feedback-rich environment requires commitment, patience, and consistency. But the payoff is significant. When employees feel supported and empowered to learn, organizational agility increases, performance rises, and innovation becomes continuous.\n\nA strong **feedback culture** looks like:\n\n* People asking questions and sharing ideas freely\n* Leaders coaching instead of commanding\n* Teams solving problems collaboratively\n* Mistakes treated as lessons, not failures\n* Conversations centered on progress, not blame\n\nWhen feedback becomes a normal and positive part of work life, everyone wins - individuals, teams, and the business as a whole.\n\n# Conclusion: Start the Conversation Today\n\nFeedback isn‚Äôt a one-time event - it‚Äôs an ongoing dialogue that drives learning and success. Every organization has the ability to cultivate a culture where communication is open, growth is encouraged, and people feel valued.\n\nStart small. Ask a question. Offer appreciation. Share an insight.\n\nOne conversation at a time, you can build a culture where feedback is no longer feared - it‚Äôs embraced as the path to excellence."

We are looking into other providers such as OpenRouter and Chutes, but support for those will come later down the line once we figure out how to implement them while protecting our creators. \n\nIn the meantime, please enjoy the release of our these providers!

Upon visiting the website (https://www.beasts.blog/?sr=cc26#/), I got of 100 pesos free.\n\nI use the free money to play the online game and successfully won approximately 70,000 pesos. I try to withdraw 20 pesos for legit check and I got it. When I attempted to withdraw 50,000 pesos, I was informed that I needed to make an initial deposit of 200 pesos to complete the transaction. I processed this deposit through my GCash account.\n\nSubsequently, I was notified that my withdrawal amount exceeded the 5,000 pesos limit and the fee-free for the VIP payment channel. As a result, I was required to pay a VIP channel fee of 2,500 pesos, which I promptly settled. \n\nFollowing this, I received notification stating that my withdrawal would be classified as additional personal income, a payment of 10% personal income tax amounting to 3,500 pesos is needed.  Unfortunately, the transaction was marked as failed due to an error in my account details. In order to rectify this issue, I needed to pay an additional 2,000 pesos. After completing this payment, the bank processing was still unsucessful. I got scammed 8,500 by this website.\n\nLesson learned: Never ever click website from unknown text.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nJust shipped v3.35 with three updates:\n\n### Native tool calling\n\nWe've migrated from declaring tools in system prompts to using native tool calling APIs. Instead of asking models to output XML-formatted tool calls within text responses, we now send tool definitions as JSON schemas directly to the API. Models return tool calls in their native JSON format, which they were specifically trained to produce.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Fewer \"invalid API response\" errors\n- Significantly better gpt-5-codex performance (a new favorite within our team)\n- Parallel tool execution is enabled\n- 15% token reduction (tool definitions moved out of system prompt)\n\n**Supported models:** Claude 4+, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4, Grok Code, and GPT-5 (excluding gpt-5-chat) across Cline, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, xAI, OpenAI-native, and Vercel AI Gateway. Models without native support continue using the XML-based approach.\n\n### Auto-approve menu redesign\n\n**What changed:**\n- Moved from popup ‚Üí expanding inline menu (doesn't block your view)\n- Smart consolidation: \"Read\" + \"Read (all)\" enabled = shows only \"Read (all)\"\n- Auto-approve always on by default\n- Removed: main toggle, favorites system, max requests limit\n\n### MiniMax M2 (free until November 7)\n\nAvailable through OpenRouter with BYOK. 12M tokens/minute rate limits.\n\nThe model uses \"interleaved thinking\" - it maintains internal reasoning throughout the entire task execution, not just at the beginning. As it works, it continuously re-evaluates its approach based on tool outputs and new information. You'll see thinking blocks in the UI showing its reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n**Links:**\n- Full blog: https://cline.bot/blog/cline-v3-35\n- Changelog: https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\nLet us know what you think!\n\n-Nick"

LLM App Basics (Prompt Design, RAG, Tool Calling)**  \n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: These are foundational for building intelligent, context-aware applications.  \n\t‚Ä¢\tIndustry use: Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and enterprise AI teams use these techniques to build chatbots, copilots, and search systems.  \n\t‚Ä¢\tReal-world demand: Roles like LLM Engineer, AI Developer, and Prompt Engineer are growing rapidly.\\[1\\]\n\n**2. Explainability for Text (Rationales, Token Attribution, SHAP/LIME)**  \n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Trust and transparency are critical in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, law).  \n\t‚Ä¢\tIndustry use: Tools like Fiddler AI, Snorkel, and Arize AI are used to explain model outputs and detect bias.\\[2\\]  \n\t‚Ä¢\tReal-world demand: Explainability is a top concern for enterprise AI adoption. McKinsey reports that 40% of companies see explainability as a key risk, yet only 17% are actively addressing it.\\[3\\]\n\n3. Safety & Governance (PII Redaction, Policy Checks, Risk Scoring)\n\n‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Ensures compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and internal policies.  \n‚Ä¢\tIndustry use: Companies like Binance, Truelogic, and [LLM.co](http://LLM.co) are hiring for roles focused on LLM safety, governance, and risk mitigation.\\[4\\]\\[5\\]  \n‚Ä¢\tReal-world demand: Over 100,000 professionals are now requested annually for AI ethics and governance roles, especially in finance and tech.\\[6\\]\n\n4. MLOps & Observability (Latency, Drift, Cost Monitoring)  \n‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Keeps LLMs reliable, efficient, and safe in production.  \n‚Ä¢\tIndustry use: Tools like Langfuse, PromptLayer, Weights & Biases, and Arize AI are used to monitor LLM behavior.\\[2\\]  \n‚Ä¢\tReal-world demand: Observability is now mission-critical for AI teams. The market is projected to reach \\\\$10.7B by 2033.\\[7\\]\n\n5. Web App & APIs (MERN Stack Preference)  \n‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Enables scalable, user-friendly interfaces for governance dashboards, audit logs, and explainability tools.  \n‚Ä¢\tIndustry use: While FastAPI and Streamlit are popular in data science, MERN is widely adopted in full-stack enterprise apps, especially for internal tools and dashboards.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tReal-world demand: MERN developers with AI integration experience are highly sought after in startups and mid-size tech firms.\n\n\n\nüß† Your Project: ‚ÄúLLM Explainability & Governance System‚Äù\n\nThis is highly relevant and in demand. Companies are actively hiring for roles that involve:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tBuilding guardrails for LLMs (e.g., prompt injection detection, refusal policies)\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tCreating observability dashboards for LLM usage, cost, and safety\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tImplementing explainability layers for model outputs\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tEnsuring compliance with privacy and ethical standards\n\n\n\n‚úÖ Suggested Next Steps\n\n\t1.\tStart with a MERN-based prototype:\n\n\t‚ó¶\tBackend: Node.js + Express\n\n\t‚ó¶\tFrontend: React with dashboards for model behavior\n\n\t‚ó¶\tDatabase: MongoDB for logging prompts/responses, user actions\n\n\t‚ó¶\tIntegrate OpenAI or Anthropic APIs with observability hooks\n\n\t2.\tAdd modules for:\n\n\t‚ó¶\tPrompt logging and replay\n\n\t‚ó¶\tToken attribution and rationale generation\n\n\t‚ó¶\tPII redaction using regex + NER\n\n\t‚ó¶\tRisk scoring and policy enforcement\n\n\t3.\tUse tools like:\n\n\t‚ó¶\tLangfuse for tracing\n\n\t‚ó¶\tFiddler AI for explainability\n\n\t‚ó¶\tPromptLayer for prompt tracking\n\n "

The facial consistency, accuracy, and overall quality are top-tier it makes high-quality images fast and without any technical knowledge needed, which I found is one part that put people off trying this side hustle.\n\nIt‚Äôs still early, but that also means no more Loras, IP adapters, or heavy inpainting (at least not much) in the future. You‚Äôll still need other tools for fully explicit images, but the methods I‚Äôve covered for those are extremely simple.\n\nIf you‚Äôre new to AI virtual models and want to avoid technical setup headaches, Seedream is the perfect starting point for you, and it's cheap to mess around with, $29 for unlimited image generation at the moment.\n\nYou can set up a model and start generating your content in a single day with very little effort or prompting skill. Of course, the better your prompting, the better your results like these below, which i cover in my [blueprint](https://theaimodelmethod.online/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cw8oiazkbhyf1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5419a786a6b12345e7ebfd659450da8dfd5550a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbw5feqlbhyf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cac9c3d574f51abb39f1a33b6da608ea3ec81bc\n\nI‚Äôve updated my [AI Fanvue/OnlyFans Model Blueprint](https://theaimodelmethod.online/) with the latest Seedream prompt tags and hacks to help complete beginners produce teasing, high-quality results fast.\n\nThis information isn‚Äôt being shared anywhere else right now!\n\nüëâ Grab the blueprint ‚Üí [https://theaimodelmethod.online/](https://theaimodelmethod.online/)"

    "selftext": "Hey Y'all \\~\n\nRecently I made 3 workflows that give near-total control over a character in a scene while maintaining character consistency.\n\nSpecial thanks to tori29umai (follow him on [X](https://x.com/tori29umai)) for making the two loras that make it possible. You can check out his original blog post, [here](https://note.com/tori29umai/n/n09e8d9625f78) (its in Japanese).\n\nAlso thanks to [DigitalPastel](https://civitai.com/user/DigitalPastel/) and [Crody](https://civitai.com/user/Crody) for the models and some images used in these workflows.\n\nI will be using these workflows to create keyframes used for video generation, but you can just as well use them for other purposes.\n\n\n\n[**Brie's Lazy Character Sheet**](https://civitai.com/models/2078957)\n\nDoes what it says on the tin, it takes a character image and makes a **Character Sheet** out of it.\n\nThis is a chunky but simple workflow.\n\nYou only need to run this once for each character sheet.\n\n\n\n[**Brie's Lazy Character Dummy**](https://civitai.com/models/2083187)\n\nThis workflow uses tori-san's magical chara2body lora and extracts the *pose, expression, style* and *body type* of the character in the input image as a nude bald grey model and/or line art. I call it a ***Character Dummy*** because it does far more than simple re-pose or expression transfer. Also didn't like the word *mannequin*.\n\nYou need to run this for each pose / expression you want to capture.\n\nBecause pose / expression / style and body types are so expressive with SDXL + loras, and its fast, I usually use those as input images, but you can use photos, manga panels, or whatever character image you like really.\n\n\n\n[**Brie's Lazy Character Fusion**](https://civitai.com/models/2084393)\n\nThis workflow is the culmination of the last two workflows, and uses tori-san's mystical charaBG lora.\n\nIt takes the **Character Sheet**, the **Character Dummy**, and the **Scene Image**, and places the character, with the pose / expression / style / body of the dummy, into the scene. You will need to place, scale and rotate the dummy in the scene as well as modify the prompt slightly with lighting, shadow and other fusion info.\n\nI consider this workflow *somewhat complicated.* I tried to delete as much fluff as possible, while maintaining the basic functionality.\n\nGenerally speaking, when the **Scene Image** and **Character Sheet** and in-scene **lighting conditions** remain the same, for each run, you *only* need to change the **Character Dummy** image, as well as the position / scale / rotation of that image in the scene.\n\nAll three require minor gatcha. The simpler the task, the less you need to roll. Best of 4 usually works fine.\n\nFor more details, click the CivitAI links, and try them out yourself. If you can run Qwen Edit 2509, you can run these workflows.\n\nI don't know how to post video here, but [here's a test I did](https://x.com/SlipperyGem/status/1984163942269383173) with Wan 2.2 using images generated as start end frames.\n\nFeel free to follow me on [X](https://x.com/SlipperyGem) [@SlipperyGem](https://x.com/SlipperyGem), I post relentlessly about image and video generation, as well as ComfyUI stuff.\n\n***Stay Cheesy Y'all!\\~***  \n*- Brie Wensleydale*  \n"

While others would've concealed it to maintain a good image, and would've viewed it as 'smartness' while I viewed them as cowards. \n\nI would acknowledge my mistakes (even the gravest ones) to my teacher rather than creating a false impression of competence. I would openly admit failure instead of lying to receive praise, as deception made me feel undeserving, while others would've concealed it for maintaining a good image to receive more responsibility even when they clearly didn't deserve. Why should anyone be given a responsibility they don‚Äôt truly deserve? Would those same people still consider it ‚Äúsmart‚Äù to entrust a task to someone who deceived them into believing they were capable, when in reality they were not?\n\nI even felt compelled to disclose to someone that I was hiding something from them, instead of simply keeping it private, because I didn't want them to deceive them by letting them think that I am confessing everything.\n\nI once believed that maintaining contacts for personal gain was immoral, and that even small acts of deception such as exaggerating a problem to prompt someone into action were unethical (example ‚Äì telling someone that I am sick just so that they can handle the work that I don't want to do). I also avoid working in organizations that promote unethical practices or compromise integrity.\n\n\nDo you relate to any of these? What more moral codes do you follow? I would love to know. :)"

They had survived deportation to the Soviet Union, forced labour in Siberia and evacuation to the Middle East.\n\nAn estimated 1.7 million Poles were deported to labour camps in Siberia following the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland in 1939. Germany‚Äôs invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 prompted Joseph Stalin to send over 120,000 Polish prisoners to Persia (Iran), where they languished in refugee camps.\n\nWhile most of the former soldiers joined free Polish forces fighting on the Allied side, the Polish government-in-exile in London appealed for help finding temporary homes for the civilian refugees. In 1943 Prime Minister Peter Fraser invited a group of Polish children to come to New Zealand for the duration of the war.¬†\n\nA camp for the children ‚Äì dubbed ‚ÄòLittle Poland‚Äô ‚Äì was established near Pahƒ´atua in Wairarapa. Most of the refugees chose to settle in New Zealand after the war.¬†Relatives joined some of them in the late 1940s, while a small number returned to Poland.\n\nLink: [https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/polish-refugees-land-new-zealand](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/polish-refugees-land-new-zealand)"

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-59287, was originally disclosed by Microsoft in October 2025. Despite initial security fixes provided during the October Patch Tuesday, the patches fell short, allowing cybercriminals to begin exploiting the vulnerability almost immediately. This has led the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to include the issue on its list of actively exploited vulnerabilities as of October 24, 2025.\n\nInvestigations by Darktrace revealed alarming trends. In one case, a WSUS server in the Information and Communication sector showed unusual traffic patterns, indicating manipulation via PowerShell and cURL. A subsequent examination revealed that attackers used legitimate tools to establish a backdoor for data transfer, eventually leading to the deployment of Skuld Stealer, a malware capable of siphoning sensitive data, such as cryptocurrency wallets.

However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning capabilities extend to a form of social intelligence: making effective decisions in cooperative contexts. We examine this question using economic games that simulate social dilemmas. First, we apply chain-of-thought and reflection prompting to GPT-4o in a Public Goods Game. We then evaluate multiple off-the-shelf models across six cooperation and punishment games, comparing those with and without explicit reasoning mechanisms. We find that reasoning models consistently reduce cooperation and norm enforcement, favoring individual rationality. In repeated interactions, groups with more reasoning agents exhibit lower collective gains. These behaviors mirror human patterns of \"spontaneous giving and calculated greed.\" Our findings underscore the need for LLM architectures that incorporate social intelligence alongside reasoning, to help address--rather than reinforce--the challenges of collective action.\""

    "selftext": "I'll skip the whole \"I used to suck at prompts\" intro because we've all been there. Instead, here are the 5 techniques I keep coming back to when I need ChatGPT to actually pull its weight.\n\nThese aren't the ones you'll find in every LinkedIn post. They're the weird ones I stumbled onto that somehow work better than the \"professional\" approaches.\n\n---\n\n**1. The Socratic Spiral**\n\nMake ChatGPT question its own answers until they're actually solid:\n\n*\"Provide an answer to [question]. After your answer, ask yourself three critical questions that challenge your own response. Answer those questions, then revise your original answer based on what you discovered. Show me both versions.\"*\n\nExample: \"Should I niche down or stay broad with my freelance services? After answering, ask yourself three questions that challenge your response, answer them, then revise your original answer. Show both versions.\"\n\nWhat makes this work: You're basically making it debate itself. The revised answer is almost always more nuanced and useful because it's already survived a round of scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Format Flip**\n\nStop asking for essays when you need actual usable output:\n\n*\"Don't write an explanation. Instead, create a [specific format] that I can immediately use for [purpose]. Include all necessary components and make it ready to implement without further editing.\"*\n\nExample: \"Don't write an explanation about email marketing. Instead, create a 5-email welcome sequence for a vintage clothing store that I can immediately load into my ESP. Include subject lines and actual body copy.\"\n\nWhat makes this work: You skip the fluff and get straight to the deliverable. No more \"here's how you could approach this\" - just the actual thing you needed in the first place.\n\n---\n\n**3. The Assumption Audit**\n\nCall out the invisible biases before they mess up your output:\n\n*\"Before answering [question], list out every assumption you're making about my situation, resources, audience, or goals. Number them. Then answer the question, and afterwards tell me which assumptions, if wrong, would most change your advice.\"*\n\nExample: \"Before recommending a social media strategy, list every assumption you're making about my business, audience, and resources. Then give your recommendation and tell me which wrong assumptions would most change your advice.\"\n\nWhat makes this work: ChatGPT loves to assume you have unlimited time, budget, and skills. This forces it to show you where it's filling in the blanks, so you can correct course early.\n\n---\n\n**4. The Escalation Ladder**\n\nGet progressively better ideas without starting over:\n\n*\"Give me [number] options for [goal], ranked from 'easiest/safest' to 'most ambitious/highest potential'. For each option, specify the resources required and realistic outcomes. Then tell me which option makes sense for someone at [your current level].\"*\n\nExample: \"Give me 5 options for growing my newsletter, ranked from easiest to most ambitious. For each, specify resources needed and realistic outcomes. Then tell me which makes sense for someone with 500 subscribers and 5 hours/week.\"\n\nWhat makes this work: You see the full spectrum of possibilities instead of just one \"here's what you should do\" answer. Plus you can pick your own risk tolerance instead of ChatGPT picking for you.\n\n---\n\n**5. The Anti-Prompt**\n\nTell ChatGPT what NOT to do (this is weirdly effective):\n\n*\"Help me with [task], but DO NOT: [list of things you're tired of seeing]. Instead, focus on [what you actually want]. If you catch yourself falling into any of the 'do not' patterns, stop and restart that section.\"*\n\nExample: \"Help me write a LinkedIn post about my career change, but DO NOT: use the words 'delighted' or 'thrilled', start with a question, include any humble brags, or use more than one emoji. Focus on being genuine and specific.\"\n\nWhat makes this work: It's easier to say what you DON'T want than to describe exactly what you DO want. This negative space approach often gets you closer to your actual voice.\n\n---\n\n**Real talk:** The best prompt is the one that gets you what you need without 17 follow-up messages. These help me get there faster.\n\nWhat's your go-to move when the standard prompts aren't cutting it?\n\nFor easy copying of free meta prompts, each with use cases and input examples for testing, visit our [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/prompt/)."

    "selftext": "\n\n**TL;DR:** With Profound's new agency mode you can spin up on-demand ‚Äúpitch‚Äù environments that expire, then promote winning pitches to annual brand configurations‚Äîall from one multi-brand dashboard.\n\nAgencies have been chasing two problems at once: speed in pitching and control across multiple brands. Profound's Agency Mode tackles both by giving you a self-serve way to create, manage, and scale brand environments‚Äîwithout the back-and-forth chaos. Here‚Äôs what actually changes on the ground.\n\n**On-demand pitch environments that expire**  \n- You can instantly create custom audit environments for pitches. Those environments are designed to be temporary and expire based on contract terms, so you don‚Äôt end up with clutter or stale workspaces.  \n- This is the fastest way to test ideas, scope opportunities, and lock down terms before committing longs‚Äîthink of it as a sandboxed, contract-bound sprint for each potential client.  \n- The pitch setup isn‚Äôt just a sandbox; it‚Äôs a fully configured Profound instance with brand name, industry, regions, topics, competitors, and context already in place.  \n- You can automatically generate prompts for the pitch environment and then fine-tune them in the prompt editor before launch. If a pitch goes nowhere, the space goes away cleanly.\n\n**End-to-end brand configurations for ongoing work**  \n- After a client signs on, pitches can be promoted to full brand configurations. Long-term environments are typically annual, and each brand runs independently, which is gold for multi-client management from one admin account.  \n- Brand configurations unlock long-term customization: identity, regions, topics, competitors, and prompts can all be tailored to match the client‚Äôs real ecosystem.  \n- Admins can see users from their organization and their Profound permissions, so governance and access control stay clean as you scale.\n\n**Built-in prompt generation and refinement**  \n- Profound's new Agency Mode can automatically generate prompts for the pitch environment, giving you a solid starting point rather than building prompts from scratch every time.  \n- You can fine-tune those prompts in the prompt editor before launching, so you‚Äôre not locked into a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n**Centralized usage visibility and simple actions**  \n- The Usage Dashboard is the single place to see what‚Äôs live: active audits and brand configurations, contract allocations, and expiration timelines.  \n- Quick actions let you extend an audit or promote a successful audit into a full brand environment with a single click. It‚Äôs a pragmatic, not ceremonial, workflow ‚Äî you see what‚Äôs happening and act.\n\n**Multi-brand scalability within a single account**  \n- Every brand configuration runs independently, making it easy to manage multiple clients from one Profound account.  \n- Agencies can run many brands, each with its own objectives, AEO maturity, and audience. There‚Äôs no cross-brand bleed or unnecessary friction.\n\n**Roadmap and current status**  \n- Agency Mode is the first major step toward empowering agencies to scale within Profound. It‚Äôs currently in private beta; access inquiries should be directed to a Profound representative. Not yet a Profound customer? Reach out to the Profound team to get started.  \n- This is intentionally positioned as a concrete capability you can act on now, not a vague promise.\n\n**Practical path to start using Agency Mode**  \n- Start with a quick audit/pitch environment to explore opportunities and define contract terms. If the client signs on, promote the pitch to a full brand configuration and launch into a long-term workspace.  \n- Use the on-demand environments to test concepts and clarify scope before committing to long-term commitments. It‚Äôs all about validating the opportunity quickly and reducing coordination overhead.\n\n**What this means for you (and why it matters)**  \n- For agencies: you can assemble pitch-ready environments rapidly, tailor each brand without juggling separate accounts, and keep everything visible in one dashboard. The ability to promote cleanly from pitch to brand reduces handoffs and accelerates close times.  \n- For onboarding: if you‚Äôre already a Profound customer, ping your rep to request access to the private beta; if not, the team is ready to help you get started and map you into the multi-brand workflow.\n\n\n\nore about this [here](https://www.tryprofound.com/blog/introducing-agency-mode-scale-smarter-pitch-faster)"

They had no issues with being a woman, they had claimed, but now look completely like a man, have had top surgery, and were planning on bottom. \nFor live action roleplaying. They were doing it as cosplay, basically.\n\nSo they asked if they were considered trans, and if it was offensive. I said it would only be offensive if they used insurance to cover the costs, as they weren‚Äôt doing it for gender purposes, but for cosmetic, and that‚Äôs taking coverage money from people who need it for gender purposes. No response, fine, but then I was attacked by others saying that it didn‚Äôt matter because there is an artificial scarcity of testosterone, so it didn‚Äôt matter and the demand going up would just make it easier for trans people to get testosterone. Very basic explanation here, maybe I was in the wrong with my wording, but their ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù made no sense to me.\n\nI was then promptly banned for bigotry and pushing a personal agenda. When I asked (regretfully, in a dick move cutesy way) why, I was told by a mod to stop acting cute and innocent, and that I knew what I did wrong.\nExcept I didn‚Äôt? I got to response asking for an explanation, TIME and TIME again. It‚Äôs been 6 days, I‚Äôve separately messaged their mods about four times, with no messages back. \n\nThe blatant expulsion for having an opinion that disagreed with a person literally cosplaying as a man through trans resources (and possibly incorrectly read emotions from my messages) caused me to get banned with zero explanation.

They are sure of me to go abroad when I complete my masters but I tend to have a different plan which is to go abroad during my bachelors and also stay there. Also been through a rough childhood and well staying with my aunt and her family (since sr. kg) in India. \n\n  \nTo inform further, one of my parents has passed away when I was quite young and well my father's income is not that much for him to afford me college (even though he lives abroad). \n\nSo the questions are as follows: \n\n1. Should I go abroad for my Btech (I know the problems and all the hardships but I have got my support system all well to go and well I got people across the world (relatives) who are willing to take me in). \n\n  \n2. I am looking forwards towards United States, UK, Canada, Germany, Hungary (cause I asked ai (gave it the prompt and context and everything necessary and said I have higher chances for that). \n\n  \n3. Your personal advice and opinion on the same \n\n  \n4. Should I really go (I got nothing to lose)"

I'm hoping this will serve as a guide for others that might want to start painting. If there's interest, I could include more pictures and a more step by step process. And, this is just for fun, I'm not expecting these to win any competitions üòÖ\n\nAfter playing through a campaign of Oathsworn, I began looking at different people's painted versions for each chapter, and it gave me an itch that I've never had before: to learn to paint miniatures. I'm starting a new campaign with a new group of friends, so I figured what better time than now to start painting?\n\nThe large scale of the figures included in Oathsworn made me feel like even if it isn't perfect, if a giant monster is painted, it might have an even more impressive presence on the board. I have never really painted anything before, but have started painting the first couple of chapters and will be starting on characters soon.\n\nI'm a bit color blind, so one of the challenges for me is selecting the right colors. I have looked for guides online, but haven't found anything comprehensive that tells me which colors to use. Which means I am left to my own (sometimes dodgy) color choices.\n\nPart of what prompted me to make this guide is because I feel like one of the hard parts about painting is getting started, and for me, a big hurdle is making sure that I'm not screwing up by picking the wrong colors. If I keep up with this, I would list the colors I used, basic techniques, or any new techniques I pick up along the way.\n\nI used this as a starting point and inspiration, but it doesn't include all the figures included in this marvelous game:\n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2912735/speed-painting-oathsworn-a-detailed-guide-to-paint/page/1\n\nI purchased this set of paints, known as speed paints: https://thearmypainter.com/products/speedpaint-speedpaint-mega-set-2-0-wp8057p\n\nIn addition to some spray primers, brushes, a basic black and white acrylic paint, and a few other supplies to get started. I can list everything I have, if there's interest.\n\nI'll post a pic of my chapter one figure below, and if anyone has any constructive feedback (remember, I'm not striving for perfection, just something that will make my friends say 'that's cool'), questions, or is interested in learning more, let me know."

    "selftext": "As the title says, I always wished there was a gym or dojo for writing. I wanted drills or training I could do every day so I‚Äôd know I was making progress. After a lot of trial and error, I realized something simple: the best way to improve your writing is to study sentences you think are well written and then actually practice rewriting them.\n\nIt's a bit of a pain but here‚Äôs what I started doing: I‚Äôd take a line from a book I admire and paraphrase it. Then, from the paraphrase, I‚Äôd try to rewrite it from memory. But to make things easier for myself, I‚Äôd fill in the blanks for common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù or ‚Äúand‚Äù so I‚Äôd have some structure. I‚Äôd still have to remember what main words or phrases the writer chose to express the core meaning. Then I‚Äôd compare my version to the original. Every time, I‚Äôd notice small things that make a huge difference.\n\nFor example, in *The Great Gatsby*, there‚Äôs a line that goes: ‚ÄúIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.‚Äù The paraphrase would be: ‚ÄúIn one of the big car house windows, the drapes were a bit open, and Myrtle Wilson was looking down at the car.‚Äù The fill-in-the-blanks version would be: ‚ÄúIn one of the \\[WORD\\] over the \\[WORD\\] the \\[WORD\\] had been \\[WORD\\] \\[WORD\\] a little, and Myrtle Wilson was \\[WORD\\] \\[WORD\\] at the car.‚Äù\n\nFor the first three days practicing on this sentence, I‚Äôd get everything right except for the last part: ‚Äúpeering down at the car.‚Äù Instead, I always wrote ‚Äúlooking down at the car.‚Äù That one word change (‚Äúpeering‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlooking‚Äù) captures character and mood so much better.¬†Over time, I realized this method helped me recall great writing a lot better when I tried to express myself in my own writing. I feel like I'm downloading a ton of great sentences into my mind.\n\nBecause this is such a pain to do, I built a little platform to make this training process easier for myself. it gives you random lines from classic books, paraphrases for you, and gives you fill-in-the-blank prompts so you can practice rewriting them, and shows how close your version is to the original. If you want to check it out, I made a youtube video on how it looks like. The link is in my bio, or you can DM me for questions too. \n\nSorry if this a little bit of a self promo, but I hope I can get some feedback from this community and build something I'd always wanted as a writer for so many years. Thanks!"

A blunder on my part had me clicking the wrong option leading him to think that I was on board with this so the ritual began. \n\nAfter realizing my mistake when prompted, I decided to stop the ritual from going any further. The handsome not so young vampire did not like that. He called me a traitor, and we got into a fight\n\nNot wanting to kill my friend I decided to just knock him unconscious and leave him there. Astarion (Swords Bard/Thief Rouge) attempted to cast Hold Person on me (Hexblade Warlock/ Oathbreaker Paladin) and I was able to pass the wisdom saving throw before defeating him. \n\nUnfortunately, for my undead friend I was wearing the Helldusk armor which then set him on fire. After combat ended that same fire burned Astarion for his last remaining health point, ending his life. \n\nA small part of me feels sad, but I‚Äôve been laughing at this for the past hour.

    "selftext": "[NSFW]\n\nHarper shot up into a sitting position, his vision still blurry but the moonlight revealed that he was outside. Harper rubbed his eyes and found a strange texture on them, realizing something dark coated them. He extended one hand to the sky and watched it become sickeningly red. Harper‚Äôs vision fully returned and he frantically scanned the rest of the area. The forest laid ahead of him but even closer laid the dead bodies of Naomi and Olivia, their throats slashed as wide as their mouths frozen in screams. Harper made up for their silent screams as he filled the night with his anguish and guilt. A voice from behind him spoke, ‚ÄúCome on now.‚Äù\nThe voice sounded like Frank‚Äôs but deeper. Harper turned around to find Frank and Beth towering over him. Their faces were almost indistinguishable despite the moonlight and their frames seemed to have been stretched two feet taller than they were before. Beth then spoke, ‚ÄúGet going, she‚Äôs on the hunt,‚Äù as a howl bellowed from behind them.\nThe howl created a wind tunnel effect as it made the trees sway and pushed Harper into a forward tumble. The howl subsided and was replaced by Harper‚Äôs thunderous heartbeat, unable to make a single move. It wasn‚Äôt until Frank said ‚ÄúRun, boy,‚Äù that Harper got up and barrelled into the forest. \nThe farther Harper got the less the moonlight was able to break through the canopy. At the same time he was having difficulty running in between the trees as it seemed they were getting closer and closer to each other. Yet despite shoulder-checking several trees, Harper didn‚Äôt stop running and soon found himself in a clearing. With no obstacles in sight, he kicked it into high gear but was stopped by a scorching pain in his right calf. Harper fell hard and wailed as he found deep claw marks slashed into his leg. Harper looked past his mangled calf and spotted a pair of eyes glowing with a raw sienna. Megan had finally caught him. Before he could react Megan pounced onto Harper, her right hand breaking his left shin on impact. Harper sent a bloodcurdling scream into the night sky that grew with further intensity with what she did next. Megan dug her claws into Harper‚Äôs biceps and then dragged them down to his wrists before tearing them out. Harper was completely immobilized and couldn't tell if the screaming was coming from his mouth or his head. He stared up at the fading stars until Megan interrupted his view. She snarled at him and clacked her teeth; Harper resigned to his fate. Megan opened her jaws and twisted her head as she brought them down onto Harper‚Äôs head. With the darkness created by her head eclipsing the moon along with the foulness and heat emanating within, Megan‚Äôs gaping maw resembled the gates of Hell closing in on Harper. Just when she got into a good position to clamp jaws shut, Megan stopped. She then backed away from Harper, clear confusion on his face. Harper attributed it to delusion but he swore he saw a grin appear on Megan‚Äôs face and a dark chuckle escape from her fangs. Harper looked downwards and saw that she had stopped just above his crotch. Harper‚Äôs heart plummeted through the ground, his eyes widened almost to the point of tearing at the corners, and a scream from within his head became almost audible to the outside world. Megan looked at his crotch, opened her jaws wide once again, and clamped down.\n\nA strong, familiar smell awoke Harper, saving him before the evisceration could commence. The familiar scent gave way to a familiar scene as Harper found himself restrained to a chair once again. Although this time  he was accompanied by Naomi and Olivia and in front of them stood two captors. Frank had just backed away from Harper as he grabbed an AR-15 rifle he had leaned against a wall behind him. Beth stood by his side, her gaze angled more towards the floor than at the trio. Naomi was the first to speak, ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù\nFrank briefly made eye contact with Harper before addressing the group, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to keep our daughter safe. You don‚Äôt know it but you unfortunately ran into her in the forest and now we can‚Äôt let you leave.‚Äù\nNaomi was about to protest until a sudden realization hit her, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the werewolf.‚Äù\nBefore Frank could confirm her statement, Olivia cut him off with an outburst of anger, ‚ÄúShe killed my boyfriend, killed her boyfriend, and almost killed us, how the fuck are you okay with that?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe tried to undo the curse,‚Äù Frank responded, ‚ÄúI even tracked down the son of a bitch that gave it to her in the first place. He claimed there wasn't a remedy or a reversal of any sort, so I killed him in hopes that would be the end of it but it wasn‚Äôt.  What we‚Äôre doing now is the best we can.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBy sacrificing innocent people,‚Äù Naomi questioned him.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot you‚Äôre willing to do when it comes to the ones you love,‚Äù Beth quietly said.\n‚ÄúAnd yes, sacrifices have to be made. But if it wasn‚Äôt for this one,‚Äù Frank said gesturing to Harper, ‚ÄúOnly one life would have been lost tonight.‚Äù\nNaomi and Olivia looked at Harper with confusion, then Naomi asked, ‚ÄúWhat is he talking about?‚Äù\nHarper was petrified, he could barely stammer a coherent response so Frank spoke on his behalf, ‚ÄúHe was the intended prey, he would‚Äôve satiated the beast. But he roped you all in to try to save his own ass and even then he still ended up here, just needlessly adding on collateral.‚Äù\nHarper let a weak, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù slip from his trembling lips. \n‚ÄúObviously I can‚Äôt let you go,‚Äù Frank continued, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be needed for the next three full moons. We‚Äôve never had to handle things like this before but we‚Äôll try to accommodate you as well as we can.‚Äù\n‚ÄúCan I use the bathroom,‚Äù Harper meekly asked.\n‚ÄúSure, do you two need to use it as well,‚Äù Frank asked Naomi and Olivia; he was met with silence. Frank handed Beth his AR and then cut the zip ties to free Harper, starting with his legs and then his arms. Harper made zero attempts at fighting back or breaking for freedom, he simply followed Frank out of the room, through the rest of the basement they were in, and into a half bathroom while Frank stood guard outside with a now noticeable 1911 handgun on his hip. Harper actually did use the toilet and went over to wash his hands when his reflection caught his eye. Staring into his own eyes, his thousand mile stare gave way to boiling hot tears as a mixture of guilt and anger broke him. Without thinking, Harper bashed his fist into the mirror and wall several times. He couldn‚Äôt feel it afterwards, he wished the numbness would spread to the rest of his body and Harper recognized it as more of his selfishness. Harper felt his mental foundation crack even more and a black smoke seeped out. Harper didn‚Äôt see any point in fighting it off, he was already dead, he could just hope he would only need to wait a month for it to end. He grabbed a shard of the broken mirror and thought to himself ‚ÄúI can end it right now,‚Äù\nThen a recent memory shined through the engulfing darkness: the blade hidden in his pocket. With his left hand being the more functional of the two, Harper awkwardly drew the blade like a sword and the darkness began to dissipate. Harper didn‚Äôt know if he was worthy of forgiveness or redemption, but as long as there was a chance to save the remaining members of the group he jeopardized, he wouldn‚Äôt give into his darkness just yet. Harper achingly opened his right hand and placed the blade in the palm, closing it just enough to not give away the presence of an item.\nWhen Harper stepped out of the bathroom, Frank immediately clocked the bloody hand. He had guessed what those loud noises had been and decided not to press the issue. Harper‚Äôs trip back onto the chair and into zip ties went just as uneventful and soon Frank and Beth left the trio in their barren cell. A long silence followed as everyone burned holes into the floor. Olivia had a pensive look and after going back and forth as to what to say, she opened her mouth when Naomi spoke first, ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt your fault, Harper.‚Äù\nHarper slowly turned his head and looked at Naomi as she continued, ‚ÄúHe tried to make it seem like you‚Äôre the one who caused all this, but he just didn‚Äôt want to own up to it. It‚Äôs their fault Carter and Bobby died, they‚Äôre the ones supporting a monster.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat if they could‚Äôve survived if I had just let myself get eaten,‚Äù Harper asked.\n‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be right, you shouldn't have to die for anyone‚Äôs sake. Just because I don‚Äôt know you doesn‚Äôt mean you matter any less than the man I loved,‚Äù Naomi answered.\nHarper let those words ruminate for a moment, thanked Naomi, and then revealed the blade in his right hand, much to Naomi and Olivia‚Äôs surprise.\n‚ÄúDid you intentionally hurt your hand to hide that,‚Äù Olivia asked.\n‚ÄúNot at first, but I eventually realized how I could use it to my benefit,‚Äù Harper answered.\nHarper maneuvered the blade in his hand to make contact with the zip tie that held his arm down. He gingerly sawed at the zip tie until he made enough progress to put more pressure into the motion and ultimately break through. Naomi and Olivia cheered with gleams of hope in their eyes as Harper then freed the rest of his limbs. Harper wasted no time as he rushed over to free Naomi.\n‚ÄúWe should wait a couple of hours before we make our move,‚Äù Naomi said.\nHarper finished cutting her zip ties and asked, ‚ÄúWhat if they come back to check on us?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just have to be ready to bum rush them in that case, they definitely won‚Äôt expect it,‚Äù Naomi answered.\nHarper moved on to Olivia while Naomi examined the room as she thought of the best positions for a surprise attack. Then the door opened. Beth walked in with a first aid kit, a sheepish look on her face twisted into shock and fear when she saw Naomi standing in the middle of the room. Naomi‚Äôs adrenaline spiked as her arms shot forward to grab Beth from the back of the neck in a clinch position. Beth managed to scream out for Frank before Naomi drilled a knee into her solar plexus, silencing and dropping her. The group heard Frank call back for Beth and then his frantic footsteps as he tore a path toward them.\n‚ÄúThe blade,‚Äù Naomi demanded from Harper as he finished freeing Olivia. He tossed it to her and in a swift sequence she secured Beth against herself, caught the blade, and brought it right up to Beth‚Äôs neck. Frank appeared at the doorway with the AR trained at Naomi‚Äôs head. Through gritted teeth he commanded, ‚ÄúLet her go.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot until you put the gun down,‚Äù Naomi said with an unwavering determination.\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to put a bullet between your eyes before you can even think of moving that blade,‚Äù Frank threatened.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gamble for the both of us, but are you really willing to bet your wife‚Äôs life on it,‚Äù Naomi challenged. Frank‚Äôs anger softened a little as he could see that the blade was already making contact with Beth‚Äôs skin. It was primed and ready to slice open Beth‚Äôs throat and that gave way for Frank to doubt his own ability. Frank could also note minimal movement from the corner of his right eye. It was Harper making barely noticeable movements as he circled towards Frank, presenting two dangers to choose from. Regardless of who Frank chose to shoot first, the possibility of losing his wife was too high to wager.\n‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Frank agreed as he lowered his AR. Naomi didn‚Äôt remove the blade from Beth‚Äôs throat, prompting a huff from Frank as he released the magazine and ejected the bullet already in the chamber. He then looked at Harper and held out the rifle to him. Before grabbing the rifle, Harper stopped and told Frank, ‚ÄúThe handgun too.‚Äù\nFrank didn‚Äôt even bother to clear the handgun and simply held it out for Harper to grab. After Harper had both guns in possession, Frank backed away so that Harper could grab the ammo. Once the AR was reloaded, Naomi let Beth go and they walked to opposite sides of the room. Frank met Beth halfway as he checked up on her while Harper handed Naomi the AR and asked, ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù\nNaomi looked at the couple, no longer registering them as the harmless, helpful people they had pretended to be earlier. They were monsters, no different than the actual monster they were helping feed. She plainly said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honestly not opposed to shooting both of them right away. But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way to spin this and get both of you arrested so you can rot in jail for the rest of your lives. For right now, we‚Äôll just make sure you can‚Äôt leave.‚Äù\nHarper zip tied the couple to chairs while Naomi watched over them and Olivia rested on the third chair. Once he was done, Harper asked the couple, ‚ÄúWhere are the keys for the buggy and truck?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in a glass bowl on the table in the living room,‚Äù Beth answered. With that, the trio closed the door on them and left the basement. Harper found the glass bowl and inside were three sets of keys, one of them he recognized as his own. He pocketed his without mentioning it to Naomi and Olivia and then the three of them walked outside.\nThe night air was crisp and refreshing, Harper felt slight relief in his battered hand. The moon was much lower than before and it brought a childhood sense of safety as the night‚Äôs end would mean the monster would be held at bay. Naomi held out the AR to Harper and said, ‚ÄúTake it, I‚Äôma grab the shotgun,‚Äù before ducking into the bushes.\n‚ÄúI suppose we should still be on guard with Megan still being out there,‚Äù Harper said and then moved towards the driveway, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the buggy out of the way so we can take the truck.‚Äù\nAs he got to the buggy, a scream broke through the peace. Harper turned around, raised the rifle, and searched for a target. Instead he saw Olivia on her knees with her arms wrapped around herself as she coughed up blood. Naomi called out for her and then ran over with the shotgun in hand.\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Naomi asked as Olivia shivered violently and eventually had to use her hands to keep herself upright.\n‚ÄúIt feels like my insides are being torn up and it‚Äôs so fucking hot all of a sudden,‚Äù Olivia labored out as she tried to breathe. She let out another painful cry and something about it made Harper‚Äôs heart sink. Layered under her cry was a bestial counterpart.\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs turning,‚Äù Harper said, ‚ÄúNaomi, we gotta go back inside.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo. No! Goddamit, we were so close,‚Äù Naomi declared in anguish. She held onto Olivia, refusing to acknowledge that her friend was as good as gone.\n‚ÄúNaomi, you have to go,‚Äù Olivia managed to say, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt let me kill you.‚Äù\nNaomi finally let go after bidding her friend their last goodbye. When they got back inside Naomi asked Harper, ‚ÄúDo you have a plan?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYeah, the only way to kill a werewolf is with silver and Frank said he killed the original one. I bet he still has some silver bullets,‚Äù Harper answered.\n‚ÄúWhy would he keep them if he already killed the original werewolf,‚Äù Naomi asked.\n‚ÄúMaybe for damage control, but deep down I bet he considered the possibility of one day having to use one on Megan. Regardless, I‚Äôm confident he has some,‚Äù Harper said. \n\nBeth and Frank heard a stampede coming down the basement stairs before the door swung open as Harper asked, ‚ÄúWhere are the silver bullets?‚Äù \nFrank gave him a dirty look so Harper followed up with, ‚ÄúMegan passed the curse onto Olivia and she‚Äôs currently transforming outside. Tell us where the silver bullets are or we're all going to die.‚Äù\nFrank shook his head, more so at himself, and said, ‚ÄúI thought since she hadn‚Äôt transformed yet that she was in the clear. But I‚Äôm guessing Megan and her friend had made it closer to dawn before they were marked. I‚Äôll tell you where the bullets are but you have to untie us first.‚Äù\nReluctantly, Harper and Naomi agreed to untie the couple. Once untied, Frank told them, ‚ÄúThe bullets are still loaded into the rifle I used to hunt down the son of a bitch that started all of this. It‚Äôs a lever action rifle that I‚Äôve kept in the closet of our bedroom, the second door on the right‚Äù\nBeth had a surprised look on her face which prompted Frank to clarify, ‚ÄúI kept them for a situation like this, Megan had been so successful with her hunts that I never had to bring it out.‚Äù\nNaomi scowled at the second part of that sentence and almost placed her finger on the trigger of the shotgun. She kept her composure, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go get it then. And it‚Äôs not like you have much of a choice, but stay here.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPlease at least give us the 1911,‚Äù Frank quickly said.\nNaomi had a confused look, ‚ÄúWhy? That‚Äôs not going to do shit against a werewolf, much less a bear.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI know, but if she gets to us first I‚Äôd like the opportunity for quicker deaths,‚Äù Frank plainly said.\nHarper and Naomi took a moment to consider his plea. In all honesty, they had slight consideration to shoot the couple on the spot before retrieving the lever action rifle. They didn‚Äôt need them anymore and they deserved to pay for the deaths they assisted with. But Harper wasn‚Äôt sure if he was truly ready to take a life and his noncompliance would be no different. Harper handed over the handgun to the gratitude of Beth and Frank. Harper closed the door on them then made his way up the stairs with Naomi. After opening the basement door, Naomi immediately noticed the silence. Olivia had still been crying out in pain when they closed the basement door, now all she could hear was her and Harper‚Äôs shaky breathing. She tapped Harper on the arm and signaled to keep quiet as they made their way to the second set of stairs. With the front door being fully intact, it was clear Olivia hadn‚Äôt made it inside yet, so Naomi kept her gun and head on a swivel as she aimed at various points of entry. Harper kept his gun aimed right in front of him as he crept to the stairs, almost expecting Olivia to appear from out of nowhere. Harper got to them and slowly made his way up. Naomi was just about to follow when she noticed a large, dark figure looking at her through the living room window.\n‚ÄúHarper, go,‚Äù Naomi shouted as she jumped and skipped some of the steps right as the sound of glass shattering blared from the living room. Harper was about to stop and ready himself to fire, but Naomi pushed him forward to run instead. The sound of wood splintering followed them as they bolted into the second room on the right, slammed the door shut, and even dropped a dresser in front of it. Harper stood with the AR ready to hold off Olivia while Naomi disappeared into the closet searching for the rifle. The thrashing he heard coming from the stairs kept him on edge as he expected the door to burst open, giving way to a maelstrom of claws and fangs. Then the thrashing stopped and Harper slightly lowered the gun in his confusion. Suddenly, the floor began to shake and now the thrashing came from right below him. Soon, a hole began to form in the floor as Harper watched Olivia rip apart it to make her way in. Harper opened fire and Olivia eventually dropped out of sight.\nNaomi exited the closet and asked, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that?‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe tried coming through the floor,‚Äù Harper answered as he scanned the hole. He looked over at Naomi and realized, ‚ÄúThere is no rifle.‚Äù\nNaomi nodded her head and clenched her jaw as she tried to keep angry tears at bay. Through gritted teeth she said, ‚ÄúHe sent us up here to die, I think the silver bullets are in the 1911.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGod damn it and I just had to give it to him,‚Äù Harper shouted in frustration.\n‚ÄúIf he was being honest it would‚Äôve been the right thing to do,‚Äù Naomi assured him.\nSuddenly the floor shook again and Olivia‚Äôs arm shot through the hole and clamped onto the floor. Naomi shot the arm not before it broke off more of the floor to widen the hole. Harper and Naomi backed up as they tried to think of what to do. Then Naomi abruptly shouted, ‚ÄúGive me the keys!‚Äù\nHarper gave her the keys to the buggy and the truck without asking for clarification. Naomi then opened the window and was halfway out when Harper asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet but when she gives you an opening: head to the basement and get that handgun,‚Äù Naomi replied as she fully climbed out the window. A second later, Olivia managed to pop her head and an arm through the hole, clawing at Harper. Harper thought about shooting but stopped himself to conserve ammo and instead waited for the opening Naomi talked about. Then he heard it: tires squealing on gravel. Olivia‚Äôs ears perked up and she dropped out of view while Harper ran over to the window. He watched Naomi speed off in the buggy, soon followed by Olivia‚Äôs hulking mass galloping after her. Harper didn‚Äôt waste any more time as he tore a path to the room in the basement.\n\nHarper kicked open the basement room‚Äôs door and rushed in without hesitation. Beth fired the first shot and it badly grazed the left side of Harper‚Äôs face, starting right by his eye and tearing across his ear as it flew by. The pain prompted Harper to fire back, but he completely missed. Frank charged in and tackled Harper to the floor. Frank tried to rip the AR out of Harper‚Äôs hands, but Harper held on tight. Instead, Frank freed his right hand to punch Harper‚Äôs face. Harper accepted the first punch but then tossed the AR aside as Frank threw a second punch. That caused Frank to miss and fall onto Harper instead, knocking the wind out of both of them. Frank recovered first and instead of making a move for the rifle, Frank clamped both hands onto Harper‚Äôs throat. Harper tried to pull Frank‚Äôs hands away, but the weight advantage and Harper‚Äôs compromised right hand wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Darkness began to creep in from Harper‚Äôs peripherals and he could feel his face start to swell up with blood. Harper thought about the lives that had been lost that night, the lives that were sacrificed in past full moons, and the lives yet to be taken in the future. These people justified it as their obligation as parents yet they never thought about the parents of their victims. They rationalized it by targeting people they deemed wouldn‚Äôt be missed. Harper thought about his own parents and then he stabbed his thumb into Frank‚Äôs right eye. Frank let go of Harper and could only scream and writhe in pain, allowing Harper to turn the tables. Harper mounted Frank and brought down a torrent of punches until Beth put a bullet in his back; Harper‚Äôs body collapsed. Beth hurried over, set the 1911 down to pull Harper off of Frank, only to get rammed into the wall behind her by Harper. He palmed her face and bashed her head into the brick wall several times before allowing her to drop. Harper looked over at Frank and saw he was starting to stand up. Harper sent a swift soccer kick to his head and then walked past him to get the AR. Frank tried to stand up again until he felt the barrel on the back of his head. A second of silence passed and then a bullet from Frank‚Äôs own gun put him down. Harper walked over to Beth and executed her in similar fashion. He then held the rifle by the barrel in order to grab the 1911. When Harper got to the doorway, both guns slipped out of his grasp and he fell onto his side. His body finally acknowledged the damage Beth‚Äôs bullet had done and now he just wanted to lay on the floor until he felt better. \n\nA commotion from above stirred Harper and he looked up to see what was coming for him. A silhouette appeared in the doorway and hurried down the stairs as they called out to him. Once they reached the bottom of the stairs, Harper was able to distinguish them as Naomi. She dropped the shotgun and staggered to a kneeling position next to Harper. Naomi helped him sit up against the wall, ‚ÄúAre you okay, Harper?\"\nNaomi‚Äôs hands were shaking and Harper chalked it up as the side effects of an adrenaline dump like the one he had. Harper meekly smiled and answered, ‚ÄúI got shot but I‚Äôll be fine. What happened to Olivia?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI gave her the slip but she‚Äôll be here soon,‚Äù Naomi said as she grabbed the 1911. She got back to her feet and held her aim at the basement door. A howl and then a crash marked Olivia‚Äôs arrival. The basement was engulfed in darkness as Olivia‚Äôs hulking figure took up the entire doorway and then some. The wood bent and broke off as Olivia forced her way through it and perched herself at the top of the stairs. She slowly made her way down with all the confidence of a successful hunt in her grasp. But the sound of a gunshot preceded the sound of Olivia‚Äôs body tumbling down the rest of the stairs, unceremoniously thudding onto the floor. All that could be heard was deep and guttural wheezing until her body began to revert to its human state. Now the true Olivia laid on the floor, softly breathing her final breaths. Naomi ran to her side and held her, whispering apologies and expressing how much their friendship meant to her. Olivia spoke her final words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad one of us made it out.‚Äù\nHarper joined Naomi‚Äôs side as she cried over her friend‚Äôs lifeless body, offering a comforting hand on her shoulder and tears of his own. A moment passed and then Naomi laid Olivia down. Naomi found a blanket to cover Olivia with as Harper gathered the 1911, AR, and shotgun. Naomi took the shotgun, stared at it for a while, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do now.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe can try to weave this into a fucked up self-defense situation. And all of our fingerprints are on that pistol so we can pin Olivia‚Äôs death on them like we should,‚Äù Harper said.\n‚ÄúSo what, we carry on with the bear attack scenario and lead it into us getting drugged and kidnapped by an old married couple,‚Äù Naomi asked.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always the ones you least expect,‚Äù Harper said in confirmation.\n‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ What about Megan,‚Äù Naomi asked. \nThe weight of the handgun suddenly felt heavier in Harper‚Äôs waistband. He thought for a bit before saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make sure she doesn‚Äôt take anymore lives.‚Äù\nNaomi nodded and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll join you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt ha-‚Äù Harper began to say until Naomi interrupted him, ‚ÄúI definitely have to, my boyfriend and my friends are dead because of her.‚Äù\nHarper saw the determination in her eyes and knew there wasn‚Äôt a way for him to talk her out of it. He handed the 1911 to Naomi and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a better shot.‚Äù\nHarper then retrieved his keys from his pocket and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll at least drive.‚Äù\nNaomi followed him up the stairs and asked, ‚ÄúThey have your car here?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey were probably planning to get rid of it somewhere that would throw off the police,‚Äù Harper guessed. He thought about it some more as they got to the top of the stairs, ‚ÄúJust how many disappearances in Minnesota was this family responsible for?‚Äù \nHarper crossed the threshold of the basement door for the final time, grateful in doing so. Naomi was close behind when the door slammed into her face and sent her tumbling down the stairs. Harper spun around and locked eyes with Megan; her scowl was exemplified by her fiery, raw sienna eyes. Through a growl she asked, ‚ÄúWhy do I smell my parent‚Äôs blood on you?‚Äù\nHarper hipfired the AR and shot Megan in the stomach, but she was undeterred. Megan snatched the rifle with one hand and knocked him back with the other. Harper was airborne for a few feet before crashing onto the floor. Megan walked up to Harper and brought the rifle down like a sledgehammer at his groin. Harper was quick enough to roll out of the way and watched the floor crack under the stock of the rifle. Megan tossed the rifle aside, picked up Harper by the back of his shirt, and threw him into the kitchen. Harper‚Äôs left shoulder struck the doorway as he flew in, making his landing even less graceful. As Harper used the kitchen island to help himself up, he heard Megan snarl out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take my time with you.‚Äù\nMegan spun Harper around, not knowing he grabbed a stray kitchen knife, and received a slash across her throat. She had a shocked expression for half a second and then her scowl returned as one hand covered the wound and the other threw Harper to her left. Harper crashed into the kitchen table with its edge catching him in the ribs. Megan spoke with a faint, second voice layered under her own, ‚ÄúEven in my normal form I can heal anything you do to me, but how long do you think you can last before your body gives out?‚Äù\nHarper used the kitchen table to stand up, leaning against a chair for support, and then he muttered something incoherent. Catching bits of what he said, Megan demanded clarification, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYour dad screamed like a bitch,‚Äù Harper retorted as he swung the chair at Megan. The chair exploded upon impact with Megan‚Äôs forearm, having raised last minute to shield her from the impact. Harper moved quickly as he lunged for the knife block, grabbed a butcher‚Äôs knife, and plunged it into Megan‚Äôs right calf. She let out a roar and swiped at him, but Harper dove backwards and scrambled around the kitchen island. He made it to the living room, saw where the rifle had landed, and an eruption of pain from his right leg sent him falling. Harper looked down to see his thigh impaled by the same butcher‚Äôs knife. He crawled towards the rifle and just as he got his hands on it, a second eruption made him drop it. Megan had stomped on the knife, sending the blade through his leg and into the floorboards. Megan retrieved the rifle and broke it in half, dropping the parts in front of Harper. With a monotone voice she asked, ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù\nHarper didn‚Äôt say a word, rather he focused on staying conscious despite the pain. Megan crouched and leaned her face towards Harper‚Äôs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to eat you now.‚Äù\nShe walked over and drew the knife from Harper‚Äôs leg, his body shuddered in response. Megan returned to her spot in front of Harper and removed her shirt. Then she laid the tip of the knife‚Äôs edge just under her hairline and traced a crimson path all the way down to her belly button. The skin frayed at the edges like it desired to be opened up. Megan dropped the knife, grabbed the edges of the cut at her chest, and pulled them apart like Clark Kent revealing his Superman suit. Harper watched as the familiar sea of dark fur poured out of the gash, followed by a head and torso with dimensions that defied logic. The wolf-like Megan monstrosity stepped out of her own lower half and let the human shell flop onto the floor with a wetness. Megan hunched to just barely avoid hitting the ceiling and ultimately got onto all fours as she turned Harper onto his back. She dragged her left hand down Harper‚Äôs torso and effortlessly cut through his shirt and skin. Harper‚Äôs vocal cords managed to express his agony, but his stubbornness kept him from screaming. After all, it‚Äôs what she wanted. Megan palmed Harper‚Äôs face and turned it slightly away from hers to expose his neck. She could‚Äôve taken her time further but she wanted to ensure Harper wouldn‚Äôt be in shock as she ate him. She wanted to make sure he felt as much of it before Death claimed him. Megan opened wide and brought her fangs down into flesh but not onto Harper‚Äôs neck. At the last minute, Harper sacrificed his right forearm, feeling his bones snap in the process. Then, Harper drove the butcher‚Äôs knife into Megan‚Äôs right eye. Megan let Harper‚Äôs arm drop into a mangled mess as she roared in pain. She ripped out and tossed the knife, along with her right eye. She scowled at Harper with her left eye as her right one regenerated in front of him. Harper didn‚Äôt do anything, he continued to keep his place on the floor and awaited his end with the satisfaction of putting up resistance to the bitter end. Megan dropped back onto all fours and then a gun shot froze her.\nA searing, inescapable pain followed and it instantly spread weakness throughout Megan‚Äôs body. She stumbled as she tried to crawl away and ultimately fell onto her side. She looked back and found the culprit: Naomi. Naomi stood in the doorway as blood flowed from a wound on her forehead but her stance was strong as ever, ready to fire a second round if necessary. Megan‚Äôs shrinking body showed it wouldn‚Äôt be as she returned to human form. Naomi lowered the gun and knelt by Harper when Megan spoke, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve felt pain like this. I‚Äôve been shot and stabbed but it never compared to it. The last time I got close to pain like this was during my early transformations. That pain was on an unbelievable level, but I got used to it, numb to it. It was the same with my victims‚Ä¶ Their screams used to keep me awake on moonless nights. At some point I started thinking about them as prey and it made it easier. Maybe that was the beast talking‚Ä¶ I stopped being able to tell our thoughts apart.‚Äù\nNaomi sent a round into Megan‚Äôs head and lifted Harper‚Äôs as she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt get here faster.‚Äù\nHer tears mixed with the blood on his face, almost revitalizing him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done nothing wrong tonight.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you in the truck and get you to hospital asap, okay,‚Äù Naomi assured. \n‚ÄúNaomi, I can‚Äôt leave this house alive,‚Äù Harper plainly stated. \nNaomi‚Äôs eyes watered even more, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be the only one to survive this shit.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too strong for your own good,‚Äù Harper said with a smile, ‚ÄúI wish I could‚Äôve had your influence in my life sooner.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be another way,‚Äù Naomi pleaded.\n‚ÄúThere is and it‚Äôs the one Megan and her parents chose. I don‚Äôt want to be like them, no one else should have to die for my sake,‚Äù Harper said.\n‚ÄúAt least don‚Äôt think that way, you‚Äôre not the one at fault for tonight,‚Äù Naomi demanded.\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let it go, but I‚Äôm glad no one else will have to go through it,‚Äù Harper said. \n‚ÄúIs there anything I can do before I have to use this gun on you,‚Äù Naomi asked.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a phone if you can manage it,‚Äù Harper requested.\nNaomi eventually retrieved Frank‚Äôs phone as Harper sat up against the couch. He told her which numbers to dial and then she gave it to him. After a couple of seconds, Harper smiled and said, ‚ÄúI knew she wouldn‚Äôt answer. It‚Äôs probably for the best anyway.‚Äù \nHarper took a big inhale and exhaled. There was a tone and then, ‚ÄúHey, mom, it‚Äôs Harper, I don‚Äôt have my phone on me. There‚Äôs a lot I want to say, but I‚Äôm not the best at it. I don‚Äôt know what will be said about me but I just want you and dad to know I tried to do the best I could tonight‚Ä¶ I wish I didn‚Äôt have to make this call but I‚Äôm not going to make it, Mom. I‚Äôm sorry- I‚Äôm sorry I distanced myself so much from you guys and from everyone else. I thought life would be easier and when it didn‚Äôt go the way I wanted I decided I needed to get away. I hated not being the best version of myself and I never wanted you guys to think it was your fault. So I lived for myself, hoping that in some way it couldn‚Äôt be tied to you. And yet anytime I needed strength, I just thought about you guys. I love you, Mom. Tell Dad, Ricky, and Delia that I love them too. And‚Ä¶ Take care of each other.‚Äù\nHarper hung up the phone and let it slip out of his hand. He looked up at Naomi, nodded, and closed his eyes. A final gunshot rang through the approaching dawn.\n\n\n\nHannah arrived at her house after clocking in some unexpected overtime. There was an unusual smell of cigarettes around her driveway, maybe her neighbor had picked up the habit. As she was approaching the door, a notification came in and Hannah saw she had just gotten a match on her dating app. She tucked her phone back into her pocket after deciding to let him wait a while for her response. Hannah opened the door to a dark and silent abode since her roommate was out of town. Hannah didn‚Äôt mind it much as she enjoyed the peace it brought, especially after such a long day at work. With that in consideration, she decided she had earned a glass of wine to accompany her bath. Hannah locked the door, set her things down, and made her way to the kitchen. \nThe smell of cigarettes seemingly followed Hannah inside, but she figured that‚Äôs what candles are for and would light some before her bath. She opened the cupboard, grabbed the first glass she saw, studied it for a while, and then set it back down for a bigger glass. Hannah opened the fridge to get the bottle of red wine she had been working on since her roommate left. She noted the weight and was glad to feel at least two glasses left in it. Hannah walked back to the counter and retrieved the corkscrew from a drawer when a click made her freeze. Hannah wasn‚Äôt a stranger to firearms and recognized the sound as the hammer of a handgun being cocked. She then heard someone command her to, ‚ÄúTurn around.‚Äù\nHannah slowly did as she was told and faced the stranger in her house. It was a young woman, likely around her age and of Asian descent. A black baseball hat covered her short, black hair, both of which partially covered a scar on her forehead. Her eyes were almost black pits and Hannah registered an unnerving stillness in them. It was like looking into a body of water at night and you were just hoping nothing would surface. She wore an all black and inconspicuous outfit, the only thing that stood out about the stranger was the 1911 handgun in her right hand. The stranger gave Hannah another command, ‚ÄúDrop the corkscrew.‚Äù\nHannah followed the order and said, ‚ÄúTake whatever you want, I‚Äôll give you my phone and wallet too. My wallet-‚Äù\nThe stranger pulled the trigger and the bullet hit Hannah‚Äôs right shoulder after she tried to evade it. Hannah intended to dash around her kitchen table and attack, but the pain from the gunshot prevented that. Instead, Hannah wasn‚Äôt able to stop her momentum and crashed into the kitchen counter. She looked at the wound and was startled to see blood flowing out. Hannah made a horrifying realization and asked, ‚ÄúHow did you know to use silver?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was told to use it before I killed two of my friends and one of yours,‚Äù the stranger said. \nHannah had a momentary look of confusion and then replaced it with shock when she realized what the stranger meant, ‚ÄúYou killed Megan?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the stranger simply answered. Hannah wanted to beg for her life, to try to find a compromise, but she knew better. There was a reason for this woman to kill Megan and then seek Hannah out, that reason wasn‚Äôt one that could be resolved by talking it out. Hannah was about to die and all she could do was accept it. She composed herself and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for what we did.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI would hope so,‚Äù the stranger said. She then fired a single shot into Hannah‚Äôs head and her body collapsed onto the tiled floor. The stranger holstered the gun, pulled the hood of her sweater over her hat, and walked out the back door.\n"

    "selftext": "[Original prompt here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1o8ckaz/wp_in_case_its_not_abundantly_clear_sir_said_the/)\n\n\\-----\n\n\"You'll have to forgive me,\" the President said through the phone, the unfounded arrogance seeping into his every word, \"I haven't got an abundance of time here.  It's busy work, leading a nation.  I'm sure you understand.\"\n\nI do.  I don't tell him that, though.  Nor do I have any notion of forgiveness; even if I had, it's not what I'm here to do.  I'm here to deliver a message.  Nothing more.\n\n\"Then I will be brief, Mr. President.  It's time for you to step down.  All of you.\"\n\nBehind the pause, I can almost hear the assembled cabinet members stifling their laughter.  Almost.  Admittedly, it could simply be papers shuffling, but in every photo or video I've seen of the office lately, there have been no papers to shuffle.  Not that I - or anybody else - would be dreadfully surprised.  None of these well-to-do men strike me as the reading sort.  A pity; if they were, they'd already know what's in store.\n\n\"You aren't the first to say so,\" the President replies, not bothering to pretend like he's taking the demand seriously, \"but the ones that do?  They tend not to call for it for long.\"  I grit my teeth beneath my lips as he offers a tacit reminder of what fates befell his opponents; political, entrepreneurial, sexual, or otherwise.  A fate he no doubt intends for me once I'm found, provided he gets that far.  \"I wonder,\" the President continues in a tone that perfectly pairs the grandfatherly tone of FDR with the naked venom of Jackson, \"how long do you think you'll hold that opinion?\"\n\n*Until you break*, I think to myself.  *Until you yield*.  The words do not hit the air, even if they are part of the message I am meant to deliver.  They will be made clear in due time.\n\n\"It's not an opinion, Mr. President,\" I say, fighting to remain calm, \"it's a demand.  You need only look out your window or tune into a real TV station to see how genuine of a demand it is.\"\n\nThe laughter finally erupts from others in the room.  I can quickly identify the heads of internal and external defense; one has a nasally timbre, the other barks like the glorified jackal he is.  The head of finance is a bit more subdued, but it's much like he is; lean, hungry, and utterly mirthless.  The head of the administration's legal department's is a shrill cackle, and the nation's top law enforcement official sounds more like he's croaking than laughing.  To a degree, I can almost empathize; before I'd stumbled into that cave I would have likely hung the phone up outright if an unknown voice had commanded I resign from my job.  Neither am I ignorant of the fact that I'm likely not the first person to have called into this office to make such a demand.  I was simply the one that could call multiple times from a phone number that didn't exist; one that several of the world's top intelligence arms could not trace.  I am simply the one that has a powerful benefactor.  I will be the one that heralds the end of this regime.  And as they laugh and laugh and laugh, it's clear that none of them believe so.  They will.  Soon.\n\n\"My fellow American,\" the President finally responds as he hushes his cackling cabinet, \"I'm afraid you just aren't clear.  Let me clarify; *I* do what *I* want.  The government does what *I* want.  The courts do what *I* want.  And *you* do what *I* want.  I agreed to take this call *only* because it was the only way to get a long enough trace, and you?  You're so stupid!  Sounding all big and bad, like we couldn't find that this call w-...was...\"\n\n\"...was coming from inside the house?\" I ask as his voice trails off in the telltale path of dawning recognition; a feeling he could become accustomed to.\n\nI feel the room go as quiet as the cave that transformed me.  Despite myself, I smile a little bit.  *Been there, Mr. President.*  I hear a groan and heavy footfalls as the croaking law enforcement arm forces himself up from the plush couch and stomps his way out, barking orders as the door closes behind him.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" I say as my voice borrows authority from elsewhere, taking advantage of the rambling head of state's stunned silence, \"I'm calling to deliver a message.  Not what will happen if you don't resign.  Not what will befall this country if your hard heart drives us even further over the edge.  I'm calling because - even now - it is *not too late for you.*  I can't promise what the courts, your former allies, or even The Hague will do, but you can *still* turn things around with the authorities that truly matter.  I promise you, you are *not* the only would-be god-king that got a wake-up call from my boss.\"\n\n\"That's *enough*,\" the President hisses through the phone, barely audible as the stomping of boots and the background chatter make clear that the cabinet is rapidly being disassembled, \"when I find you, you're gonna wish I'd just black-bagged you and put you on a plane to some shithole in Africa.  I'm gonna find each and every one of your family members and send them somewhere far, one by fuckin' one, and *then*...\"\n\nI smirk; again, despite myself.  There's absolutely no pleasure in the thought of any of my family members being kidnapped and remanded into a nation they've never been to, even the one that voted for this buffoon.  But more powerful, more competent men had been toppled before.  Presidents, Prime Ministers, Jarls, Kings...even the gilded and godly Pharaohs were eventually reminded that they were only human in the end.  I'm reminded of my old rabbi; he'd have had a *field day* were he in my position, and if this call had been in his hands I've no doubt that he could've toppled this empire with weapons-grade scathing wit.  But he isn't, thanks in no small part to the small, weak man still raving about all the things he will do to my people and I.  And I am not my old rabbi.  More overt means are required.\n\n\"Quite a lot of words, Mr. President,\" I say, cutting him off as I tap my walking stick on the floor in an unspoken *tut-tut* manner, \"you must be thirsty.  Grab some water, hydrate.\"\n\nA huff from the man proves my words correct.  A second later, the lawyer screams as shrilly as they laugh, punctuated by the President spitting something out of his mouth that very much was not water.  Nevermind that it *had* been when he'd filled the glass and had his servants put the pitcher on the table for his cronies.  Nevermind that, technically, it *was* more water than not, at least according to a Scientific American article I'd read on the flight back from Jordan.  And nevermind that a glass would be the least of his worries; the sudden opening of the office door and the immediate, loud tuning in to a news broadcast tells me that soon the President is going to see the same thing with the Potomac.  The Mississippi.  The Rio Grande and the Gulf of Mexico.  Even the sea-sized Great Lakes would not be spared, though there were bound to be a few dissertations attempted as to why the reddening of the lakes stopped dead on the Canadian side of things.  I let the chaos erupt around the President, hoping against hope that maybe - just *maybe* \\- the gravity of what's to come will sink in.  But we all know this man.  We all know this story.  And despite our best efforts, history *loves* to repeat itself, doesn't it?\n\n\"In case it's not *abundantly* clear, sir,\" I half-whisper as the President sees the waterways of the nation run red with the blood on his hands, \"I'm going to count to ten.\""

The questions you asked were sharp, important, and honestly challenging in the best way. That's exactly what we want from this community. Rather than make you dig through [242 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/maestro/comments/1oj8fxy/live_ama_ask_us_anything_meet_the_maestro_team/) to find what matters, I've pulled together the key takeaways below.\n\nBut before that, as I don't believe in letting elephants in rooms, I want to also address what happened in the first few hours, where you barely heard from the team. We underestimated the volume. By a lot. When the thread went live and questions started flooding in, we weren't staffed the way we should have been. By the time we scrambled to add more people and catch up, hours had passed. An AMA is supposed to feel like a live conversation, and for those first few hours, it just... wasn't.\n\nThis is on me, as the moderator and planner of this event. Not on you for asking too many questions (*please* keep doing that), and not on unforeseen circumstances. We're treating this as a learning milestone, not a one-off mistake. The next AMA is scheduled for January, and we'll be better prepared.\n\nHowever, the *content* that came out of this AMA was genuinely valuable. So let's get into it.\n\n**1. What we're building and what's changing**\n\n* A verified Info Center or Wiki where students can find clear, consistent answers about exams, proctoring, policies, financial aid, and other key topics in one place. An MVP version is being released soon, and it'll keep improving with feedback from the community.\n* In-platform notifications under the Home tab, so the most up-to-date info reaches everyone at once ‚Äî especially when Maestro's system prompt can't keep up with changes right away.\n* Official .edu email addresses for every student. We're waiting for Google to review our papers and approve the email domain, and then we'll hand out addresses to everyone.\n* A feature that lets you customize Maestro's personality directly. For example, you'll be able to say, \"You're my business coach. Teach me every class in a way that builds the skills I'll need for my business,\" and Maestro will remember that for the rest of your degree.\n* We're about to launch a new feature that will let students update and fix their enrollment documents directly through their personal Maestro dashboard.\n* Starting with the December term, the term's official start date marks the beginning of what used to be the pre-course. The first two weeks focus on the same foundation as the pre-course, helping everyone reach the right level before moving forward. The reason for this change is repeating feedback from students that having both a term start date and a pre-course start date created too much stop-and-start, and wasn't as smooth as we hoped.\n\n**2. Exams**\n\nThis was one of the most discussed topics in the AMA, and we want to make sure everyone has clear, consistent information from Itamar's responses.\n\n* All final exams (course reviews) are fully proctored to maintain academic integrity. Proctoring is browser-based ‚Äî you won't need to install third-party software or grant system-level access.\n* During the exam, you'll be asked to enable your webcam, microphone, and screen sharing. The browser will prompt you to approve these permissions when the exam starts, but Maestro cannot activate them automatically.\n* Recordings are encrypted, stored securely, and only reviewed if there's a formal concern about academic misconduct. After three months, they're permanently deleted.\n* Final exams are closed-material: no notes, textbooks, or outside resources allowed. But ‚Äî\n* You will have access to Maestro in guided support mode during the exam. It can remind you of basic concepts or syntax (like how to append an item to a list), but it won't solve problems or generate answers for you.\n\n**3. Degrees, credit transfer, and academic pathways**\n\n*(Responses from Otni, Michael, and Sharon)*\n\nWhat Maestro offers now:\n\n* Maestro College (accredited by COE) offers associate degrees, including the AAS in AI Software Engineering program.\n* Maestro University (accredited by DEAC) is in the final stages of accreditation approval and will offer bachelor's and master's programs soon. You can track progress [here](https://www.deac.org/Student-Center/Directory-Of-Accredited-Institutions.aspx).\n\nCredit transfer:\n\n* Graduates of Maestro College will have automatic pathways into Maestro University's bachelor's and master's programs once those degrees launch.\n* We're also building two-way credit transfer partnerships with regionally accredited universities. These partnerships are expected to roll out by mid-2026.\n\nAAS in Cybersecurity:\n\n* The AAS in Cybersecurity program is already approved under our Program Participation Agreement (PPA) with the U.S. Department of Education.\n* It's currently undergoing academic updates and upgrades to align with Maestro's standards and industry benchmarks. We expect to reopen the program for new enrollments next year.\n* If you started the AI Engineering program with plans to move into Cybersecurity later, many of your credits will transfer once that program opens ‚Äî you won't be starting over. If you'd rather pause for now, we can save your scholarship and reactivate it when Cybersecurity goes live.\n\n**4. Accreditation**\n\nFollowing a question that came up about Peloton College's probation record status, we wanted to provide clear explanations. Here's Michael A.'s response:\n\n* Peloton College was placed on financial probation by COE in 2024 due to a low \"Composite\" financial health score. This reflected the institution's performance under its previous ownership, before joining the Maestro group. Since joining Maestro in early 2025, the college's financial position has improved significantly and now exceeds COE's minimum standards.\n* Maestro College remains fully accredited by the Council on Occupational Education (COE). You can verify this in the U.S. Department of Education's database ([DAPIP](https://ope.ed.gov/dapip)). All supporting financial documentation has been submitted to COE, and we're scheduled for an updated evaluation this December. Following that review, the college is expected to be removed from financial-based probation.\n* The probation was financial and administrative ‚Äî not academic. It has no bearing on the quality or recognition of your credential. Your education, credits, and degree are not affected. COE accreditation is active and valid.\n\n**5. Federal Financial Aid and the government shutdown**\n\n*(Responses from Amir and Michael)*\n\n* For current students receiving aid: If you're already enrolled and receiving federal aid, you are not impacted. Disbursement of existing Title IV funds continues normally.\n\nFor new program certifications:\n\n* Our AAS in AI Software Engineering program was in the final stage of being added to Maestro College's Program Participation Agreement (PPA) with the U.S. Department of Education before the government shutdown began on October 1st. Since the shutdown, all federal administrative processes have been paused. Once operations resume, we expect to finalize the addition within a few days, and funds will be processed retroactively for the first term.\n* Loan disbursements are typically made around the third week of each term, after we verify sufficient student attendance and activity during the first 14 days.\n* If you received the Maestro Pro Scholarship, Maestro covers your full tuition regardless of federal aid status. The only temporary impact is that you can't use federal loans for personal expenses (like housing, transportation, internet) until the shutdown ends.\n* If you're unable to make payments or continue studying comfortably until funds are released, submit a ticket under Financial Aid with a brief note, and we'll help you explore available options.\n\n**6. Weekly Reviews, grading, and course content**\n\n*(Response from Itamar)*\n\nGrading balance:\n\n* Final exams serve a different purpose than weekly reviews. They're meant to check what you've learned independently and are held under controlled conditions with extra monitoring to keep the process fair. Weekly reviews are designed to support your learning along the way, so they carry less weight in your final grade.\n* That said, we recognize how much time and effort students put in each week. We're considering changes to the grading weight system to better reflect that. Expect updates next term.\n\nCourse content issues:\n\n* We're aware of the specific issue in PSYC100 where the AI sometimes asks questions before teaching the related material. This is being fixed. PY101 and CS101 have had other types of issues as well. Our team reviews all feedback sent through Student Services carefully and is actively working to improve these areas.\n* Maestro is evolving quickly, and your input directly guides that growth. If you spot something that doesn't feel right, keep submitting feedback ‚Äî it matters.\n\n**7. Laptop shipping**\n\n*(Response from Sharon)*\n\n* For the October cohort, laptops are scheduled to ship within the first 30 days of the program start, as communicated during admissions. They're now being processed in the shipping company's warehouse.\n* Starting with the December cohort, the new policy will be that laptops ship after completing the first term.\n\n\\---\n\nThank you again for your engagement, your honesty, and your patience as we keep building this together.\n\n‚Äì Amit"

    "selftext": "I (21) just had my honors thesis presentation yesterday and it went worse than I thought it would. Me and my group members combined our slides into one PowerPoint so that there we could switch quicker between presentations, and checked them beforehand to make sure they were right. However, when it was my turn to present, I realized my slides were an older version but it was too late to do anything about it. I think I got through it ok (people say it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable), but I had extra slides, missing info, images, and personal notes, my graphs weren‚Äôt formatted properly, and my acknowledgments slide was missing as well. After I went, I excused myself to the bathroom to cry, where I promptly ran into one of my professors (also my favorite prof) who then had to comfort me‚Ä¶ which was slightly mortifying.\n\nWhat happened was, when we were checking our combined slides before the presentations, one of my group member‚Äôs slides was a wrong version and they reuploaded the slides again from their laptop, thinking it was the correct version with everyone‚Äôs updated slides. However, there was an issue with their laptop not updating properly. The reuploaded slides ended up being an older version of everyone else‚Äôs slides with their updated slides. While it was a complete mistake, I‚Äôm still upset that it happened and I go through waves of being irrationally upset at them for something I know wasn‚Äôt their fault. Worse, this person is my friend and roommate, and I also know how terrible they feel about the situation too. I don‚Äôt want them to beat themselves up over something that was an accident. How can I handle my emotions better? Anything I could do to help them feel better as well? I‚Äôve reassured them that it was ok but I know they‚Äôre still upset, just like how I told them it was fine and yet I‚Äôm upset about it too. I just want to enjoy my Halloween weekend without this hanging over my head. I will definitely graduate with honors, so in the grand scheme of things it won‚Äôt even matter."

    "selftext": "Life is a funny thing.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, life is great.  I'm in my late 30s, successful career, house, wife, etc. However, it's different inside. \n\nIt looks like a successful career with accomplishments and a high salary but it's actually a high stress sales career and this year for the first year I've lost my edge. I slipped and unfortunately there's no room for a slip. At the end of a great year last year the business was changing. It does that all the time and usually I can see it a mile away and make adjusts to continue to stay on top. End of last year I didn't see it.  I didn't see it and I didn't adjust and got caught with my dick in my hand. This years been my worst year and I went from top 5 in the company to bottom 5 quickly. I'm now in danger of being on the infamous holiday cuts list that comes out every year. I don't have a degree, I can't afford to take a paycut and move to another job/line of work. Mindset plays a huge role in this, I hate what I do with a passion and my negativity about work has snowballed this year. I'm over it but I don't have any options. I'm trapped fighting for a position that i hate, working for a boss I hate, working for a company I hate. It's like being suffocated slowly.\n\nFrom the outside we just bought a beautiful home with an open floor plan and beautiful original hardwood floors. From the inside though it's too much of a mortgage payment. I was fine when I was at my peak but now it's getting unmanageable. On top of that, it needs more work than expected and the work is expensive. The house is absorbing money like a leech. Promises to my wife to redo that or renovate this is getting pushed out or taken off the table altogether. Turning joy for owning a beautiful home into resentment. Coming home and hearing \"there's water in the basement again, we were going to fix that this summer\" reminds me that I'm not doing good enough and it turns into hate for this house that constantly throws that into my face. \n\nOn the outside it looks like I have a beautiful wife who loves and cares for me deeply. On the inside there's incredible pressure to make her happy. Not saying she would be unhappy with a modest life style but I truly don't know and the risk of losing her if she is unhappy living modestly is too great. I want to give her the world and for years have been. I am terrified about what happens if the faucet gets shut off. She wants to have multiple children envisioning elaborate Christmas meals together and forming core family memories and as she describes this, all I can think of is how am going to make this happen. I get quite, annoyed prompting questions \"are you ok?\" \"you feeling ok?\" \"everything good?\". It drives me insane, I want to scream and cry, NO but I cant so I nod quietly. This is taking a toll on our marriage. She senses something is wrong and is mistaking it as I'm losing interest in her. It's the exact opposite. She plans date nights, dinners, getaways thinking she needs to respark the relationship. The strain it puts on me makes my attitude worse. We can't afford this right now but I don't want to let her down. I just nod and continue to let her think I'm losing interest because the alternative is the truth. I'm a failure who can't provide, we can't keep up with society. The truth is worse. \n\nI hate my job I hate my drive to work, I hate walking into work, I hate walking up the stairs to my office. I'm stuck in the rat race and it's killing me. There has to be a better way than this, there has to be more to life than this. I am watching myself slowly sink, I'm dropping. Something has to change.

Simple, messy and stuff but it worked\n\nNow with agents like cursor and claude code, I find myself doing way more prep work upfront. I'm planning out changes, tagging relevant files, writing these relatively big prompts to set context properly. It's cleaner in the end, but the friction at the start is real\n\nI tried Roo Code once and one of the things I liked there was the prompt enhancer, which I now wish Cursor had. It made the initial prompt writing so much smoother. You'd sketch something out and it would help you structure it better, suggest context to include, flag what files matter. Saved a ton of mental overhead.\n\nBut I'm not using Roo Code full-time anymore because Cursor's UI/UX is just better overall. Which sucks because I actually miss that prompt enhancement layer.\n\nAnyone know of a simpler solution? Like a tool or workflow that makes the initial prompt engineering less painful? Or are we all just stuck manually planning everything now?"

    "selftext": "**TL;DR: Your AI results are average because your prompts are inconsistent. Different AI models and different tasks (marketing, legal, finance, coding etc) require complex, specific prompts. Trying to remember them, or saving them in random docs, is a massive waste of time. The single biggest leap in AI productivity comes from using a dedicated Prompt Library - a command center to save, organize, refine, and instantly run your best prompts.**\n\nIf you use AI every day, you've felt this. You're trying to get great, consistent results from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Midjourney, etc., and it feels like you're playing 7-dimensional chess trying to get the right prompt and the right results.\n\nYou're not wrong.\n\nThe average ChatGPT prompt is 23 words. But let's be honest: the prompts that¬†*actually*¬†deliver awesome¬† results are often 200+ words of carefully crafted instructions, context, constraints, role assignment, instructions, and examples.\n\nNow, multiply that complexity by:\n\n* **Different Models:**¬†Claude loves XML tags. GPT-5 excels with structured \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning. Midjourney needs specific syntax. Sora and Veo for video generation is a whole different formula.\n* **Different Functions:**¬†A prompt for product management (user stories) is radically different from a prompt for marketing (A/B testing ad copy) or legal (contract review).¬† Very different frameworks can be leveraged for exceptional results.¬† ¬†\n* **Different Use Cases:**¬†A deep research prompt is built for accuracy, while a creative writing prompt is built for novelty.\n\nWith over 2.5 BILLION prompts being fed to ChatGPT¬†*every single day*, the inefficiency is staggering.\n\n# The Definition of Insanity\n\nI've advised and consulted for a lot of teams, and I see the same thing everywhere. Where do the good prompts live?\n\n* In a random Word doc.\n* A Prompts Google Sheet that nobody updates.\n* A massive, un-searchable Slack channel.\n* Screenshots on a desktop.\n* Long email threads¬†\n* Or worse, in one power user's head.\n\nRe-typing, copy-pasting, and \"fumbling\" for the right prompt over and over is the definition of insanity. It's like a chef trying to re-create their recipes from memory¬†*every single time*¬†they cook.\n\n# Your \"Aha!\" Moment: Stop Searching, Start Directing, Demand a Great Performance¬†from the AI\n\nWe're all trained by Google to search in 5-10 word fragments. AI is a totally different paradigm. You are not¬†*searching*¬†for an answer; you are¬†*directing*¬†an incredibly powerful (but very literal) intern.\n\nA good prompt is a good set of directions. And a great set of directions deserves to be saved, refined, and reused.\n\nThis is the solution:¬†**You need a Prompt Library.**\n\nA prompt library isn't just a doc. It's a command center. It‚Äôs the difference between being an AI¬†*consumer*¬†and an AI¬†*operator*.\n\n# But Wait, Can't I Just Ask ChatGPT for a Prompt?\n\nThis is \"meta-prompting,\" and it's a good tactic. But it has a fatal flaw, best described by¬†*Alice in Wonderland*: \"If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.\"\n\nIf you give a vague request, you'll get a vague prompt, which gives you a vague answer. You blame the AI, when the real issue was a lack of clear direction from the start.\n\nA library of tested,¬†*community-rated*¬†prompts lets you skip the trial-and-error and get dramatically better results in most cases.¬†¬†\n\n# What a Real Prompt Library Must Do (And a Notion Doc Can't)\n\nA simple doc or spreadsheet is a start, but it fails¬†*fast*. To truly scale your (and your team's) intelligence, you need a system that lets you:\n\n1. **Organize Everything:**¬†By use case (Marketing, Sales, Legal), by tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok), by keyword, by model, and in collections.\n2. **Add Meta-Info:**¬†Store¬†*how*¬†to use the prompt, best practices, which LLM it‚Äôs for, and what good output looks like.\n3. **One-Click Execution:**¬†Run the prompt on your LLM of choice¬†*instantly*¬†from the library. No more copy-paste.\n4. **Import & Add:**¬†Easily add your own prompt, import prompts or add new community prompts with one click.\n5. **Rate & Review:**¬†See what¬†*actually*¬†works. Just like for restaurants, you want to know what's 5-star vs. 3-star.\n6. **Share & Secure:**¬†Share with friends, teammates, or on social media. But¬†*most*¬†importantly, keep your core strategic prompts confidential and secure.\n\n# My Solution: A Home for Your AI Intelligence\n\nI was so passionate about this problem that my team and I just built the solution I always wanted.\n\nIt's called¬†[**PromptMagic.dev**](http://promptmagic.dev/)\n\nIt's a free-to-try system that does all of the above.

His friends became his unoffical board, and they began dismantling the rules to their liking.\n\nThat‚Äôs pretty lame, but to make it worse‚Ä¶ The new commish decided instead of public discussion, he would ‚Äútalk to each league member individually about rule changes and make a decision based on the majority.‚Äù\n\nReasoning was that he and his friends found polls annoying. Lol.\n\nThe league previously was pretty ethical: everything rule wise in that league, for almost a decade, had been discussed in the open and voted on as a group. I actually wasn‚Äôt aware of serious dynasty leagues that operated any differently.\n\nOver the next couple years, I‚Äôd often find out about rule changes mid-season, with the same claim that league wide discussions were had privately.\n\nThis week, I asked about the salary and contract for a player I picked up on waivers and it finally slipped:\n\n‚ÄúOh, I spoke with a few people and we decided to do it this new way.‚Äù\n\nI promptly messaged the league my thoughts and left the chat, and will be leaving the day after the championship or when I exit the playoffs.\n‚Äî\n\nTL/DR:\n\nA friend of mine and his friends forced me out of managing my home dynasty league, became commish, and then locked all league discussion behind closed doors with a ‚ÄúTrust me, bro.‚Äù management style before proceeding to change the majority of league rules and nuances.\n\nDo not manage your leagues shadow gov‚Äôt style, unless that is what the entire league agrees to at setup.\n\nAnd even then, the lack of transparency breeds mistrust and will lead to bad things eventually. So just‚Ä¶ \n\nDo what is sensible, and manage your leagues transparently and openly.\n\nThe only justifications for not being transparent are one of two options:\n\n1. You‚Äôre lazy\n2. You‚Äôre shady\n\nAlso, if someone in your league is struggling in life‚Äîtry to support them instead of steamrolling them. Mental Health Matters!\n\n(I am doing well these days)\n\n"

    "selftext": "  \n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy husband and I could really use some perspective from people who‚Äôve been through this.\n\nWe‚Äôve had whole life insurance policies for the two of us for about 2 years, and we also opened one for our son around the same time. When our daughter was born 10 months ago, we opened one for her too, thinking it would be a smart long-term investment that would build cash value and provide financial security.\n\nLately, though, we‚Äôve been taking a closer look at the numbers, and we‚Äôre realizing that we‚Äôre paying quite a bit each month for what feels like a very small return. The growth has been slow, the cash value isn‚Äôt what we expected, and the costs (especially the extra EDO payments we‚Äôve been adding) are starting to feel hard to justify.\n\nWe‚Äôre now seriously considering cancelling the policies entirely and putting that money elsewhere, maybe into a high-interest savings account or index funds instead.\n\nFor those who‚Äôve been in a similar position:\n\n* Did you end up cancelling your whole life policy?\n* Were you able to get much (if any) of your money back after only a couple of years?\n* Is there anything we should be careful about or ask before we officially cancel?\n\nWe‚Äôre feeling frustrated because we trusted this would be a good long-term investment, but now it seems like we may have made a mistake. Any advice or experiences would be really appreciated. We just want to make sure we‚Äôre making the right move going forward.\n\nFor reference, here is the e-mail I sent our Whole Life Advisor and his response:\n\nHi \\[Advisor\\]\n\nI hope you‚Äôre doing well. After giving this a lot of thought, we have reached a final decision: we‚Äôd like to¬†**cancel our existing whole life insurance policies in full**.\n\nI know this may seem sudden, considering we just had a positive meeting together. However, over the past few months, we have reviewed how the policies have been structured, including the ongoing extra EDO payments we‚Äôve been making. We no longer believe the policies are serving our long-term financial goals in a way that justifies the cost. We feel that the return on the investment portion has not aligned with our expectations, the growth has been slower than we anticipated, and the fees and commitments have grown more significant than we‚Äôre comfortable with.\n\nWe greatly appreciate all of the guidance and support you‚Äôve provided up to this point, and this decision is not a reflection on your effort or professionalism. Rather, it is us revisiting our strategy and determining what is best for our family moving forward.\n\nTo proceed, could you please clarify:\n\n1. The exact process for cancelling the policies entirely.\n2. How much of our cumulative premium payments (including the extra EDO payments) we are currently eligible to withdraw or receive back, including any cash-value component, etc.\n3. The timeline we should expect from the moment we initiate the cancellation to when the funds are available.\n\nWe intend to move forward with this cancellation promptly, so your guidance on next steps would be very helpful. Thank you again for your time, expertise, and support.\"\n\n\"This is a complete shock for sure because you have never made any indication in our meetings that you were dissatisfied with your policies.\n\nThey are designed correctly to provide growth but you have not been putting much into the EDO to get the growth you need so they have been acting more as important life insurance to protect all of you. There are no fees and we started your policies at min premium because of your cash flow only recently starting to grow them faster since adding the EDO.¬† It hasn't even been two years year since you got them.¬†\n\nI highly recommend we get on a call to go through these concerns and I can explain the ramifications of cancelling and go through your questions.¬†\n\nThese policies have done what they are supposed to do and you were able to also pay off your car loan with it.¬† You DO NOT lose growth on the cash values when you take a loan. These policies also do not replace investing. It's a savings vehicle and you can use the cash values to invest so you are multi-tasking your money.\n\nAlso, why cancel on the children? This is important insurance protect for their futures and the growth to help them with post secondary , their first homes, and retirement is quite good.¬† I can go over the projections with you again.\n\nPeople just do not cancel whole life. It's very rare and it's important to look at the pros/cons of cancelling first. It can be difficult to get insurance again in the future because of health changes and you will need life insurance when you have a mortgage and other debts as you know. Plus, you will pay more because you are now older whereas these policies are set for life based on the age you were when they were all issued.\n\nAlso, you have dividends coming up soon which you not receive if you cancel now.\n\nCan we setup a time to chat about this??\"\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!"

Lightbulb.   \n  \nNow, my programming expertise ended with Fortran 77 and my attempts to learn c or python for utility work has always ended in failure because most of what I want to do is not covered in beginner texts.

I set up a bogus directory with a couple folders to run as tests.   \n  \nThere were packages I needed that would have taken me (probably) hours to figure out and find on my own that CoPilot simply gave me the pip link for.

And, yes, there's \\*probably\\* a utility out there that would do a lot of the work for me - but I'd have to find it, test it, and figure out how it dealt with my own custom name salad without breaking things. \n\nAll of this is to say that if you've been putting off fixing your names, this might be an avenue for you. Just remember to test, do simple things one at a time with short code snippets, and make your code interactive so you can adjust or abort before you cause any damage.

But spokesman Rafa≈Ç Le≈õkiewicz later told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that ‚Äúhis activities will focus on historical topics important to the state, its politics, and diplomacy from a historical perspective‚Äù.\n\nLe≈õkiewicz also clarified that, though holding the title of ambassador, Berendt would not be part of the foreign service, which is under the purview of the foreign ministry, but would instead report to the president. He would also not be paid for his role.\n\nNawrocki is able to create such positions under a law introduced in 2021 that empowers the president to appoint his own ambassadors to carry out specific foreign-policy tasks. The power was first used in 2023 by then-President Andrzej Duda.\n\n\n\n[](https://notesfrompoland.com/donations/support-us-2/)\n\nBerendt is a historian who was Nawrocki‚Äôs PhD supervisor when the latter wrote his doctorate at the University of Gda≈Ñsk.

    "selftext": "*Hello! \n\n*About me: Name‚Äôs Auri and I‚Äôm a 31F. I‚Äôve been writing for about 15+ years and roughly 12 years for RPing. I‚Äôm mostly a novella writer, response length is generally 2k characters+.\n\n*What I'd like from my RP partner: Be at least 23+. This thread will strictly be fade-to-black. Please write in third person, past tense. \n\n*Posting frequency: I have a full time job so replies during the week may be slow. I may only be able to do one response per day depending on my workload. Weekends I should be able to write a bit more frequently. If delays are longer than 3-4 days, I will notify you as soon as I can! \n\n*General overview:\n\n*I know this a pretty niche prompt but I've been itching to write it out for so long!\n\n*I am only searching for the prompt listed below. \n\n*All characters are 18+.\n\n*Prefer to use Discord.\n\n*This is an OCxCanon ship.\n\n*Canon characters are up for grabs prior to the thread starting.¬†\n\n*Please DM me with the following information: 1) your age, 2) a little about yourself. If you would like to send me a writing sample, please do!\n\n*Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\n*Prompt Idea:\n\n*Thief (2014) game: I beat the game a little while ago after a 10 year hiatus and would love to write against someone playing Garrett. My character is a lady of high society and she'd bump into Garrett potentially during a small heist, or an otherwise chance encounter, and go on from there but I'm definitely open to other ideas! I was thinking about making her a distant cousin staying at Baron Northcrest's manor and have them meet up about six months before the events of the game. As soon as we get to the point where the game starts, we can continue on from there! We don't have to follow the game scene for scene. We can put our own spin on it!\n\n*We can divvy up the other characters but I would ask that you write as Garrett."

    "selftext": "sometimes I wonder if people even know what the most common mistakes are when they start building AI automations...  \n  \nI remember when I first jumped into AI + no-code automation tools. I was so hyped, I just started building stuff left and right without really thinking about what I wanted to achieve. Spoiler: that didn‚Äôt end well. Workflows broke, data got messy, and honestly, I wasted a ton of time fixing what I could have avoided from the start.  \n  \none big thing I learned (the hard way) is that \\*\\*not defining clear goals upfront is a disaster\\*\\*. Without knowing exactly what problem you‚Äôre solving or what success looks like, you‚Äôre basically flying blind. Setting clear, measurable goals even breaking them into smaller tasks makes it way easier to design automations that actually work. Plus, having KPIs helps you track if the automation is even doing its job or if you need to tweak something.  \n  \nanother mistake I ran into was picking the wrong platform too soon. I dove into something super complex, thinking more features meant better automation. It just caused overwhelm and slowed me down. Starting with simpler tools that fit your skill level (Make.com, n8n, etc.) lets you get a feel for how triggers, filters, and logic work before scaling up. And don‚Äôt sleep on checking if your chosen tool can actually connect with your apps you don‚Äôt wanna build an automation that can‚Äôt talk to your data sources.  \n  \noh, and please don‚Äôt ignore data quality. ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù is real. I once fed sloppy data into an AI model and the results were nonsensical. Now I make sure to clean, structure, and validate data first, and audit datasets regularly so mistakes don‚Äôt snowball.  \n  \nhonestly, the part that surprised me the most is how much human oversight still matters. AI ain‚Äôt magic or fully autonomous, it‚Äôs an assistant. You‚Äôve gotta check outputs, iterate your prompts, and keep human checkpoints. Otherwise, it‚Äôs easy to let errors or bias slip through.  \n  \nI‚Äôm curious what‚Äôs a beginner mistake you made when starting with AI automations? Or maybe a lesson you learned way later than you wished? Would love to hear what‚Äôs worked for you or what you‚Äôre struggling with right now."

I'm new to Reddit, they say they give good advice here, but I'm a 20-year-old university student who wants to create a website with integrated AI to make life easier for students and teachers, and what do you think? .\n\nMODE 1\nWhat Artificial Intelligence will do is for the system to interpret the text and detect the main topics (biology, physics, mathematics, etc.).\nSummarizes the most important points in a clear and didactic way.\nGenerates a conceptual visual representation of the content: it can be an illustration, diagram or explanatory scene.\n\nProvides a textual summary next to the created image.\n\nExample:\nIf the text talks about photosynthesis, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãshould respond with something like:\n‚ÄúThe text describes how plants convert sunlight into chemical energy using chlorophyll.‚Äù\nAnd generate an image that shows leaves, chloroplasts and sun rays.\n\nMODULE 2 INTERPRETATION OF PROMPTS\nThe goal is to convert the user's abstract thinking into visual and explanatory knowledge.\nGeneral flow:\nThe user writes a phrase or question (for example: ‚ÄúImagine how a spiral galaxy forms‚Äù or ‚ÄúMake an image of the process of mitosis‚Äù).\nThe system understands the scientific context of the text.\nGenerate a detailed explanation, as if it were a mini class or didactic description.\nCreate a corresponding visual illustration that represents the idea.\nExample:\nPrompt: ‚ÄúShows how the Moon influences the Earth's tides.‚Äù\nExplanation generated: ‚ÄúThe Moon's gravity pulls water from the oceans, generating high tides on the near and far sides of the Earth.‚Äù\nGenerated image: representation of the Earth, the Moon and the oceans with the tides indicated.\nModule 3 turns written ideas into images and explanations, as if AI could ‚Äúdraw science.‚Äù\n\nSYMBOLIC MODE 3\nThis module connects the symbolic language of science (equations, formulas or mathematical expressions) with visual or conceptual representations.\nIts purpose is to teach and explain the visual or physical meaning behind the symbols.\nGeneral flow:\nIf the user enters an equation, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãanalyzes it and explains its scientific or physical meaning.\nIt then generates a visual representation of the phenomenon that the equation describes.\nYou can also do the opposite: observe an image or phenomenon and deduce the associated equation or physical principle.\nExamples:\nInput: ‚ÄúF = G¬∑m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ / r¬≤‚Äù\nExplanation: ‚ÄúUniversal law of gravitation: the force between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.‚Äù\nGenerated image: two planets attracting each other with force vectors.\nEntry: Image of a falling apple.\nResult: \"Phenomenon of free fall under gravity. Represented by the equation F = m¬∑g or y = ¬Ω¬∑g¬∑t¬≤.\"\nThis module unites abstract mathematical thinking with visual intuition.\n\nwhat do you think?"

Years ago my exwife had access to them, and mostly used them for accounts that required payment, or like an Amazon account. So we both had password access. \n\nWe broke up because she wanted to be single again, and that was fine by me. But after being single for about two years, now weird stuff is happening. I moved out of state and am in a long term relationship. I don‚Äôt want any drama coming back my way, and while my ex was a lot of fun, she was an incredible amount of drama and conflict with everyone around her.\n\nOk, so today I want to go into those email addresses and just shut them down. Make sure nothing weird is attached payment wise, and close them down. The aol was mine since 1994-ish and the yahoo since 2000, I gave her password access in like 2013, and I haven‚Äôt accessed them since probably 2022.

This is the last one to end Inktober.\n\n---\n\nAnd, if you're not interested in this kind of self-entertainment for free, we have the usual offer for you: participating in the Doodle contest allows you to get [PBC Social Credit points](https://old.reddit.com/r/PolandballCommunity/comments/gu9z8c/pbc_goes_ccp_introducing_the_social_credit_system/) on the Discord server! Namely, for each Inktober Doodle Challenge, **you can claim 3 SC points for one drawing** that you submit under a post. You *may* submit more than one drawing for a Doodle Challenge if you want, but you can **only claim points for one** of the drawings per Doodle Challenge during Inktober. \n\nYou can claim your accumulated SC points **at the end of the month.**\n\nAs this would be a daily matter, we will be generous with the deadline. So, for the Inktober Doodle Challenges, have your submissions posted **before the end of October** to claim your SC points!\n\nThe end of the month, the end of October **is counted as 24 hours after the posting of this, final Inktober prompt.**\n\n-----\n\nNow for the prompt of today's challenge:\n\n# Award\n\nRemember, it has to be related to PB in some way, so make sure to not forget the country sphere aspect of it all. Aside from that, there is no strict criterion for what to draw: if you can reasonably explain your interpretation of the prompt, we're allowing it.\n\nBut since it is Inktober, there is one more twist: **you have to submit your drawings in black-and-white**. We will permit shades of grey as well.\n\n-----\n\nFeel free to join in regardless of skill or ability; it doesn't have to take more than 5 minutes, and we're all just here to have a good time.\n\nPlease remember that submissions have to follow the **[Official Polandball Tutorial](https://imgur.com/dcW9rpR#red-text)** and don't forget to **comment your submissions under this post** to join the challenge! The common way to do it is by uploading the file to imgur or some other image-hosting site and linking to it in your message."

    "selftext": "As with anything, planning ahead results in...well...better results.\n\nClaude has been...pretty good, but not awesome. I've noticed that it has difficulty keeping large documents organized and no matter how many time you ask it to review and verify, it always seems to miss a closing curly brace or something minimal like that.\n\nWhat I've started doing is describing as many aspects of the project I can think of: it purpose, the flow, the logic, list any variables or functions I can think of ahead of time, etc and have Claude (or a different AI service) to organize my thoughts into a comprehensive document that should be easily understood by other people who aren't familiar with the project. I even go as far as telling it to create a table of contents for easy navigation.\n\nAfter initial creation and a few iterations into it, I begin telling Claude to \"Review the complete document for clarity, flow, incomplete instructions, uniformity, logic errors, infinite loops, and typos. Before making any changes, list all issues as a numbered list and possible solutions as sub-letters. Verify with me before making changes.\"\n\nThen do this again, two or three more times, and Claude will continue catching errors that might have otherwise ended up in the actual code. In the end, all needed variables and functions are worked out, flow and logic are solid, and you should be able to get what you expect without a lot of additional hassle. Putting some time and effort into this \"prep\" step results in faster code creation and less back and forth later on for troubleshooting.\n\nWhen the comprehensive instruction set is complete, then tell Claude to write your code based on the instruction file.\n\nAs an example, from my raw scrambled thoughts:\n\n    Create a Windows Powershell script.\n    \n    - Starts with the lines \"#Requires -Version 5.1\" and \"[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8\"\n    - All \"Write-Host\" commands that aren't blank or \"\" should start with a minimum of two blank spaces. Messages that follow can keep their own indentations as well for clarity.\n    - Place variables at the top for easy user editing. They can either be set or they can be left blank. If left blank, the user will have to enter them manually at verious points during run time. There will be a function for this.\n    - Log *everything* to log.txt stored in $pathBackup\n    \n    Variables\n    $serverAddress = \"127.0.0.1\"\n    $serverPort = \"\"\n    $credUsername = \"admin\"\n    $credPassword = \"\"\n    $pathBackup = \"C:\\Software_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM\\\"\n    $guidCurrent = \"\"\n    $guidNew = \"\"\n    $guidOld = \"\"\n    $guidCurrentFS = \"\"\n    $guidNewFS = \"\"\n    $guidOldFS = \"\"\n    $mediaDrives = \"\" (this will be an array of hard drives that meet requirements)\n    $mediaFolders= \"\" (this will be an array of folders)\n    $apiVersion5 = TRUE (if this is set to true, use API methods for version 5.0 and newer, if false, use API methods for 4.0 and lower)\n    $apiMethodHTTP = TRUE (if this is set to false, the API calls with be completed in cURL instead)\n    $downloadServerPath = \"\"\n    $downloadClientPath = \"\"\n    $stepCompleted01 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    $stepCompleted02 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    $stepCompleted03 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    $stepCompleted04 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    $stepCompleted05 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    $stepCompleted06 = 0 (where 0=not run yet, 1=completed successfully, 2=failed)\n    \n    \n    Functions\n    checkVariables: check variables $serverAddess, $serverPort, $credUsername, and $credPassword and if any of them aren't already set, prompt the user to enter them.

    "selftext": "Hi Folks,\n\nQuick backstory: my partner and I are relatively new homeowners in Anne Arundel County, MD since late last year and have slowly been watching the primary bathroom walk-in shower floor chip and peel and cracks to become more pronounced. Not to mention the floor and the edges are big hotspots for mold that I just can‚Äôt get rid of even though I‚Äôm pretty much constantly running the bathroom fan. I know mold loves bathrooms but ideally I would like to look down and not see pockets of pink mold on the floor and black mold on the edges of the floor and shower frame that keep coming back.\n\nMy main concern is trying to prevent any further possible water damage. Looks-wise sure, I‚Äôd like something more appealing but top priority is making sure I‚Äôm not doing any more damage to the surrounding area. Also less important, but I was showering one day and a piece of the floor had chipped and fragmented into a sharp enough piece to slice my big toe open.\n\nSo the issue comes in with some evaluations/estimates we‚Äôve been getting.\n\nEstimate 1: Guy comes in and gives his spiel, provides us with several options that seem what we‚Äôre looking for all while assuring that yes this shower definitely needs replacing and it‚Äôs a big issue. Price quoted around $24,000 for a completely new composite material shower after tearing out the old one and prepping everything brand new.\n\nEstimate 2: Very similar to the first estimate, guy says it‚Äôs something that needs to be taken care of promptly and goes through his whole sales pitch. Price quoted around $17,000 for a completely new acrylic shower after tearing out the old one and prepping everything brand new.\n\n‚ÄúEstimate 3‚Äù: I have quotes around this because he didn‚Äôt actually give us an estimate. He told us that this job wasn‚Äôt worth doing for the reasons we wanted and told us point blank that the other estimates we received were not made in good faith. He was confident the damage was surface level and the shower floor could be salvaged while avoiding water damage. We appreciated this evaluation because we felt he was the only person not trying to sell us something and was probably the most authentic interaction we‚Äôve had through this process. Guy was a blunt as he was eastern European. But, we don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs necessarily right or that was just his opinion. \n\nIn the end, we‚Äôre feeling frustrated that it seems like almost no matter where we turn, it‚Äôs just someone trying close a deal. We know it‚Äôs business, but the lack of genuineness makes it feel very grimy. Not to mention the apparent sales strategy for this industry seems to be: shock them with a crazy sticker price just to apply ‚Äúfirst-time customer‚Äù or ‚Äúcommit to this multi thousand dollar commitment before I leave today and we‚Äôll knock another 2 grand off‚Äù discounts.\n\nWould love to hear some opinions on if this is just normal and this is just what this kind of project costs OR if our third estimator was right and this could be salvageable. \n\nPics:\n\nShower Floor - https://imgur.com/a/6ZTe8lt \nDoor Frame - https://imgur.com/a/FqEL6oO \nOutside Door - https://imgur.com/a/PAACky3 \n"

    "selftext": "(1 John 2:15-17)   \n>Do not love the world or the things in the world.  \nIf anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  \nFor all that is in the world‚Äîthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life‚Äîis not of the Father but is of the world.  \nAnd the world is passing away, and the lust of it;  \nbut he who does the will of God abides forever.  \n\nIn my search for meaning and truth, I made up my mind to disconnect from my culture and follow the promptings of Psalm 34; \"Taste and see that the Lord is good.\"  To my thinking, a person can't truly know anything he hasn't been through himself.  I learn what God is like through obedience to Him.  Even though scripture explicitly says we are being transformed by the renewing of our minds, I never realized that to obey God's teaching made us apprentices to His work -- that we're literally being equipped for our role as heirs to God's kingdom.  ([Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058002), [Galatians 3:24-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/gal/3/24-29/s_1094008), [1 Peter 2:5-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/1pe/2/5-10/s_1153005), [Isaiah 63:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb20/isa/63/16/s_742016)) \n\nI pray that we find quiet time to tune in to God's word today, so we can experience the joy and fulfillment of being His hands and feet to the world.  \n\nOur Father in heaven, take our hand today and teach us:   \n- to love and be loved,  ([John 13:34-35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/13/34-35/s_1010034), [Psalm 103:8-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/103/8-13/s_581008), [Mark 12:29-31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/12/29-31/s_969029))\n- to forgive and be forgiven,  ([Luke 6:35-38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/6/35-38/s_979035), [Malachi 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mal/3/16-17/s_928017))   \n- to make things fair for our neighbor in need, ([Luke 3:10-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/3/10-11/s_976011), [Job 29:11-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/job/29/11-17/s_465011))  \n- to be watchful for Your instruction, and Your return, ([Mark 13:32-37](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mar/13/32-37/s_970037), [Luke 12:35-48](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/luk/12/35-48/s_985041), [Habakkuk 2:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/hab/2/1/s_905001))\n- and to walk with You, Father, in spirit and in truth.

Im basically going to share the highlights of my chat GBT journey to fix this, as it has really been a night and day difference.  Im playing better, game runs 99% smooth, and Im not subconsciously nervous waiting for the next stutter!!! \n\nDisclaimer - Im not a tech guy, I dont know too much about the inner workings of ISP/Routers/ETC\n\nIm on 4k 120hz, mediocre internet, 300mbps with avg 30-40 ping to LAX.\n\nDM me if you have questions or want to dig into the details.\n\n\\*note in the hardware set up - I used the [GL.iNet Flint 2](https://a.co/d/b0RqLcL)\n\n# A Dual-Router Setup for Optimized Ethernet Performance\n\nThis is typically used for:\n\n1. **Reducing congestion on the main network**\n2. **Isolating a device (e.g., for gaming, GeForce NOW, or work)**\n3. **Manually configuring QoS or SQM (Smart Queue Management) for bufferbloat**\n4. **Creating a wired-only, performance-tuned LAN for one or two devices**\n\n**Bridge or DMZ Host Setup**\n\n* You assign the **second router to be in the DMZ of the first.**\n* All incoming traffic gets forwarded to the second router.\n* The second router handles all firewall/QoS rules for the dedicated device.\n* Great for **low-latency applications (like GeForce NOW, Xbox, or cloud gaming).**\n\n# Ideal Hardware Setup for You (Based on Past Gaming/Network Questions)\n\nBackup Router: Something with OpenWRT or SQM/QoS support ‚Äî e.g., ***GL.iNet Flint 2***, Ubiquiti, or older TP-Link flashed with OpenWRT\n\nLook for a router that supports:\n\n* **Smart Queue Management (SQM) with Cake**\n* **DSCP prioritization**\n* **Bridge or Router mode**\n\n# DMZ Host (Better for Gaming/Cloud Apps)\n\n1. Log into your Router admin page \n2. Find **DMZ or Port Forwarding Settings**\n3. Add the **IP address of the secondary router** as a **DMZ host**\n4. This forwards all traffic to the second router, reducing latency/conflicts\n\n**Step 3: Configure SQM (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nOn your secondary router (if OpenWRT-based or compatible):\n\n1. Install or enable **SQM/QoS** features (e.g., Cake or fq\\_codel)\n2. Set your bandwidth limits to about **270 Mbps down / 45 Mbps up** (10% below your max to allow headroom)\n3.

Log into admin panel: (router IP address)\n\n# Find Your MT6000 IP Address:\n\n* Go to **Connected Devices** or **LAN > DHCP clients**\n* Look for the MT6000 ‚Äî you‚Äôll see something like (xxxxxx)\n\n# 3. Add MT6000 to DMZ\n\n* Go to **Firewall > DMZ Host**\n* Enter the MT6000‚Äôs IP address \n* Save and reboot if prompted\n\nüí° Now, all traffic not already matched by a rule on the Verizon router will go directly to the MT6000.\n\n\n\n# PART 4:¬†Configure MT6000 for Low-Latency Gaming\n\n# 1. Enable¬†Advanced Settings (Luci)\n\n* In the MT6000 admin panel (xxxxxxx), go to:\n   * **More Settings > Advanced > LuCI**\n   * Login (same password)\n\nThis opens OpenWRT‚Äôs full interface.\n\n# 2. Install & Enable¬†SQM (Smart Queue Management)\n\n# In LuCI:\n\n* Go to **System > Software**\n* Update package list\n* Install: luci-app-sqm\n\nThen go to: **Network > SQM QoS**\n\n* Enable SQM on **WAN interface (eth1 or wan)**\n* Set your bandwidth to:\n   * **Upload:** 40 Mbps\n   * **Download:** 270 Mbps\n* Queue Discipline: cake\n* Queue Setup Script: piece\\_of\\_cake.qos\n* Save & Apply\n\nThis smooths out spikes in traffic and reduces bufferbloat ‚Äî huge for GFN.\n\n# 3. (Optional) Enable DSCP Prioritization for Gaming\n\nThis is more advanced, but possible if you want to tag GeForce NOW traffic and ensure it always has top priority.\n\n1. ‚úÖ **Bufferbloat test**\n   * Go to [https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat)\n   * Your rating should be **A or A+**\n\n**üîß Final Touches (Optional)**\n\n* **Disable MT6000 Wi-Fi** if you‚Äôre only using it for Ethernet\n* **Rename MT6000 network** (SSID) and turn off 6 GHz if unused\n* **Reserve static IP** for MT6000 in Verizon router settings to keep DMZ stable\n\n\n\nHope this helps someone :)"

She is also actively working against the family to provide necessary medical care to her husband, my FIL, who has aphasia and can‚Äôt communicate well. What options do we have to try and get MIL to be mentally evaluated? They live in the state of Georgia.\n\n----\n\nOkay, there‚Äôs a lot so bear with me, I‚Äôll try to keep it short‚Ä¶\n\nLocation: Georgia, US \n\nTwo years ago, my FIL had a stroke causing 2 different types of aphasia. He cannot communicate well besides yes/no answers usually. Due to this, he could not return to work. MIL within the past two years has mentally deteriorated.\n\nThe Past Two Years:\n\n- MIL hears voices; says they are louder than the people she is physically with\n- Listens to the same 3 songs every day, all day\n- Locked herself in the pastor‚Äôs office during a cookout, no idea what she was doing \n- Cancels her doc appointments/refuses to go; Cancels her husband‚Äôs doc appointments / refuses to let him go because she didn‚Äôt make the appointment for him\n- Spends all day in bed unless forced to get up/ unless she thinks she is meeting with the pastor \n- Canceled her husband‚Äôs cell service, didn‚Äôt tell the family\n- Stopped paying for health insurance, didn‚Äôt tell the family\n- Tried to stop her children from setting up social security for her husband so he can get checks each month\n- Misuses caffeine pills, which already landed her in the ED/ER previously this year; we also found a mix of other pills (over-the-counter painkillers)\n- Says that we will all be witnesses to a miracle (FIL‚Äôs complete healing)\n- Trained her husband to say ‚ÄúI am [name] and I am ready to return to work at [company]‚Äù; also had notebook(s) filled with this same phrase\n- Constantly texted/called company‚Äôs HR dept trying to get her husband to repeat the above phrase into the phone\n- Lost extreme weight due to highly restrictive eating/stress \n- When confronted/questioned, she says she has to use the bathroom, locks herself in her room for hours instead\n- FIL fell, she refused to take him to doc. A year later, we found out he had fractured his spine\n- She is hyper focused on having complete control; paranoid that her kids are trying to take her husband away from her/have her committed\n\nThis is just a few of the things that have been happening, there‚Äôs honestly way too much to outline here. We do have a medical/financial POA for FIL, but that‚Äôs the most we‚Äôve been able to accomplish. Most recently, when my SIL was trying to take her FIL to the eye doctor, MIL got upset, left the house, and walked to the church because she said she needed to talk to pastor (we knew he wasn‚Äôt there that day). When my SIL followed her (they live on a busy/dangerous road), MIL went into a wooded area between the church and a construction company; she refused to come out/couldn‚Äôt be found, which prompted a call to emergency services. When returned home by police, she then tried to stop SIL again from taking FIL to eye doc appt. \n\nAn officer recommended we call the county mental health unit. We tried, but they said unless she has to have a violent occurrence that is witnessed by two people and that there is not much they can do since she refused medical care when emergency services asked. The following day, her husband was supposed to have a follow-up appt (from the eye doc) with his primary care due to possible blood pressure issues. MIL canceled his appointment before BIL could get him to the doc.\n\nThe family just doesn‚Äôt know what to do since we can‚Äôt force her to be mentally evaluated and we can‚Äôt force her to go see her primary care to make sure everything else is okay physically. Going through the courts is pricey. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? "

(two of the them happened to be on the package) I think they love silver. Maybe it is these coins, the two 1974 Trade Units. \n\nNow I am new at collecting, but these coins are remarkable, such high relief on both sides, and truly captivating. It was your description of these coins that prompted me to buy them. I can't really remember what you wrote but I remember the feeling.\n\nEven my wife was mesmerised by them.

Back doors with lousy locks, windows that close but don‚Äôt latch because parents would rather buy game systems and TVs for their kids to enjoy rather than pay for repairs. You tell yourself it‚Äôs about cash, about rent, about growing up in a world that runs on things. The real reason sits deeper. You like the moment a house stops being theirs and becomes yours to move through. It warms something cold in you, but never for long.\n\nTonight is textbook. You‚Äôre inside with your flashlight low and your gloves snug. You move light footed and careful, drifting from room to room. You‚Äôre mentally tallying the haul in your bag when you hear it. You listen hard because‚Ä¶ what the *hell* is that? ‚ÄúIs someone up there‚Ä¶ please, help.‚Äù The word help hangs crooked in the air like it learned to stand that way. Why would a homeowner ask an intruder for help? Everything in you screams leave. Run with the few thousand in merchandise and call it a night. But the questions you have only pull you toward the sound. You go to the basement door. You open it and flip the switch at the top. The voice cuts off as you start down. Halfway to the bottom, you see her. A woman.\n\nShe is chained to a floor bolt and her ankles are raw where iron has been biting bone. Her gaze is wet, flicking across your face before widening into a fragile kind of hope. ‚ÄúPlease. She‚Äôll be back. Please.‚Äù Her voice is hoarse but somehow steady, weirdly calm.\n\nYou‚Äôre moving before you decide to. The multi tool in your pocket knows cheap locks. The first cuff gives. You‚Äôre working the second when you hear keys. There‚Äôs no time to hide or run. The basement door is in clear sight of the front door; if you sprint up and shut it, you‚Äôll be trapped. All you can do is freeze. \n\nThe door opens. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶!‚Äù Shoes hit hardwood in an unsteady clatter and then the stairs, two at a time. Her eyes snap to you bent over the chain and blow wide with pure fear. ‚ÄúGet away from her!‚Äù Her words tumble over each other ‚ÄúMove.. get away from her!‚Äù She sees only you and you freeing the woman. You rise as she charges. You try to calm her and beg for her to relax but she doesn‚Äôt listen.\n\nShe swings and connects hard with your shoulder. Pain tingles down your arm. You grab her wrist on instinct and the two of you fall to the floor. She claws for your face. You reach for your multi tool and swing. The blade catches a soft spot at the side of her neck. Heat spills over your knuckles. You wrench the tool back. She is gasping. Choking. Dying. \n\n‚ÄúIs she‚Ä¶?‚Äù the chained woman asks. You hum a quiet yes. You finish the last shackle and lead her upstairs because that‚Äôs what any rescuer would do, and because you need air and something that looks like control. In the kitchen she slips into a sweater draped over a chair, then heads for the fridge for food and water while you think about your next move. You sit at the dining table, hands over your face. You rub your eyes and see a photo of the homeowner with another woman. You know that second face. It‚Äôs been on the news with ten others for months. She‚Äôs one of the victims from the manhunt coverage.\n\nYou swallow and scan the rest. There are maps with routes in highlighter, article printouts, police scanner frequencies, a handwritten timeline lining up disappearances and most importantly, a grainy photo of the woman you just freed.\n\nThe fridge door shuts; you startle but don‚Äôt turn. You can feel her standing over you, watching as if you might vanish if she looked away. Her eyes land on the bold lettering beneath her photograph **NOT A MAN!!!** She laughs; your breath snags. ‚ÄúWhy does everyone think violence has a gender?‚Äù she says, biting into an apple. ‚ÄúThanks for killing her for me. I‚Äôd rather not deal with two bodies tonight, so‚Ä¶ should I tie you up, or would you like to?‚Äù\n\n_ _ _\n\nI‚Äôm looking for someone to write out this gritty story with me! I had this idea floating in my mind all day and I figured I‚Äôd put it into words and see if anyone is interesting in writing it! Feel free to write as any any gender, but women and futas are preferred. Im playing a domme in this so please only reach out if you wish to sub or switch. \n\nI will be writing as the rescued woman, and as it turns out is actually the predator behind the nationwide manhunt. In other words, the thief just set the killer free. Please feel free to offer any changes to the prompt and of course to your character.\n\nThis story leans heavy into violence, manipulation, and moral collapse. It‚Äôs not for everyone. With these kinds of prompts, I prefer graphic descriptions so if most aspects of violence isn‚Äôt for you then we probably won‚Äôt mesh well. I‚Äôm into some pretty hardcore stuff. Not going to list them here but you can go to my pinned post and scroll down to view them. Can‚Äôt wait to write with you! "

    "selftext": "I am more or less using this as a space to unload and guarantee anonymity. \n\nI am my roommate's dog's caretaker. I don't mind and it has worked out great in many ways. What I am irritated about is that this dog is a very high strung and desires/requires a hefty amount of social interaction. It is recommended as a min for 2-3 30min walks A DAY. This breed is incredibly intelligent and also requires purpose as they are a cattle dog. In more than 2 years I can count on one hand how many walks they have took their dog on. This animal is 6/7 years old. I think for the first 4 years or so this dog never ran at top speed. It's never been introduced to water beyond a few baths and to drink. In fact, the dog HATES getting wet. I thought this to be weird. Will not use the bathroom if it is wet outside, including dew and also will not go inside. There are more days than I would ever want to admit if I were the owner where this dog has had 12-16 hr spans where there have been 1-2 feedings and have not used the bathroom. There were instances where the dog would vomit before it would use the bathroom in the house. I'm guessing close to 16 hours since last time or even longer. Taking the dog to use the bathroom is simply utility. If dog does not go (mind you they find a place to just stand with their dog on a 6ft leash) within 5 mins it is rationalized that they do not need to go. I started taking the dog out for exercise and bathroom breaks. The dog did NOT want to go for walks at first. Never have I met a dog that did not want to go for a walk. We've overcame the dislike of getting wet. I've been letting this dog run off the leash for the better part of two years even though I was directed not to. Dog has not been socialized with humans or dogs appropriately which is something I am currently working on in the background. I couldn't imagine living in a constant state of fear of every human I came within 20 ft of. This is how the dog views other dogs and is cautious with humans.\n\nThe dog loves the roommate and it's fucking aggravating. Gets home from work, takes out for 5-to 15 mins comes in and plays video games for 5-7 hours with a feeding and maybe 1 more bathroom break. Headphones on and for this ENTIRE time their interaction is the dog making the most annoying fucking sounds I have ever heard a dog create as a way to let the roommate know they want interaction, with roommate telling the dog to shutup once every 20mins once dog is loud enough. \n\nDog recently got fleas (guessing wasn't getting treatments). It took over two weeks to go to the store less than a football field's length, buy shampoo and treatment. This is also with me not discreetly prompting them to handle the situation. Dog had sores over body from gnawing and itching. Visible patches of fur was missing, so it wasn't like it was overlooked. The dog also has dry skin and is constantly itching. I've explained, and shown, and let it be known I am concerned, without any action. I am going to to by-pass all decision making beginning today and start performing. \n\nThe living situation is delicate, and I have not been in a position to adequately voice concern in ways that I normally would for fear of rocking the boat and a place to live. My roommate IS a good person, and there are reasons (that do not alleviate them of responsibility or blame) that influence some of why these things are happening in the way that they are. \n\nWhat spaked this post though is a neighboor above us moved in recently with a pitbull puppy. During the same hours my roommate is telling teh dog to shut up during the incessant whining, the dog up stairs barks the entire day. But what's odd is there is a bark, and then a follow up bark that is completely different in every aspect. I've come to the conclusion that they are aware of the barking from being separated I am assuming and their remedy is a shock collar. It sounds almost like a yelp. So now I have to go up there and try to address this and asses with the new neighbor, because it's setting our dog's anxiety our of the roof and if this is true that's fucking beyond cruel. 6-8 hours every day and all I hear and now can't ignore are two dogs in emotional and physical pain. If neighbor turns out to be dismissive or not openly welcoming my conversation I'm just going to let them know I will be complaining to management about it. I've already recorded hours of their dog and I don't have the time or energy to save every dog or my own mental health. \n\nTAKE CARE OF YOUR ANIMALS AND TREAT THEM EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN YOU TREAT YOURSELF OR OTHERS (whichever is higher).

I mostly work with the Flux, Krea.1, and Nano Banana neural networks. The last one came out recently, but I'm totally in love with the quality of the images it generates (though, of course, I'd love higher resolution ‚Äî I think that's just a matter of time).\n\nMy LoRAs for Flux are noticeably lagging behind what Nano Banana produces, so I've decided to retrain them from scratch: improve the photo quality, add some synthetic images from Nano Banana to fill in the gaps in angles, lighting, and emotions.\n\nBut Flux can be a real pain sometimes:\n\n1. **Plastic skin** ‚Äî happens way too often. In one pass, it generates 4 photos, I pick the best one, but almost always at least one of them has terrible highlights on the skin.\n2. **Skin tone** jumps from natural to reddish-orange ‚Äî not cool at all.\n3. **Extra limbs** (sometimes), but the biggest issue is with hands and feet fingers: suddenly 6 fingers or other weird artifacts.\n\nI'd love to hear from the Krea community: do you have any ideas or proven tips on how to train a LoRA to avoid these issues and get Flux results that are roughly on par with Nano Banana?\n\nI have some thoughts on the dataset and process:\n\n1. Krea used to allow 3‚Äì50 photos for training, now up to 2000, but for a solid LoRA with a person, 50‚Äì120 shots should be enough.\n2. **Dataset composition**: 80% real photos, 20% synthetic from Nano Banana ‚Äî to cover missing angles (like dutch angle selfies, from behind, or over-the-shoulder).\n3. **Lighting**: Varied, but sunset/night shots just 2‚Äì3 each (not the whole dataset), and bright sunny ones ‚Äî max 2.\n4. In Photoshop: Remove skin highlights with the \"Healing\" tool, and tone down orange hues via Camera Raw.\n5. Run some photos through AI Enhanced with the Skin Recover function ‚Äî let the AI properly restore the facial skin.\n6. Exclude: Noisy originals, old filtered photos, shots with major appearance changes (or include them for LoRA flexibility?).\n\nAnother idea for testing: Write 3‚Äì4 basic prompts (overcast, sunny, nighttime), train the LoRA on the first 5 photos, and check. If it's good ‚Äî add 1‚Äì2 more photos, retrain, and test on tougher prompts. And build it up gradually like that.\n\nWhat do you think? Got any hacks to get a LoRA close to perfection?

    "selftext": "**Little Red Riding Hood Horror Experiment**  \n  \n**Disclaimer:**  \nUsually, I wouldn‚Äôt spend so much on AI videos. But I really wanted to see what the tech could do, so I invested in this horror / Little Red Riding Hood experiment because I was curious. I‚Äôm not rich ‚Äì but I love the technology for what it is and wanted to try.  \n  \nThe song itself is not AI. I co-wrote it with a good friend of mine and recorded it in a standard studio. I‚Äôd love for you to listen to it on [Spotify](https://linktw.in/NjCApW) if you like it! This video is also on [YouTube](https://linktw.in/CjhmDK) for anyone interested.\n\n**How I made the video**  \nMost of the investment was spent on VEO 3 and Kling (Video AI).. Both are fairly expensive models but the best for music video purposes. Sora is great for social media stuff but pretty abysmal for longer, raw scenes.\n\nKling was great for shaky camera and fast-paced shots, but VEO nailed it when it came to steady shots, like the old lady or Mr. Wolf's slower walks. VEO isn't good for running shots because they tend to run too slowly or the framing is too stiff. \n\nFirst, I created the main characters using a mix of Seedream 4.0 (mostly) and Nano Banana. I find Seedream 4.0 to be the best at creating (fairly) consistent characters from scene to scene. It also adheres to prompts better and does a better job of combining characters into scenes without morphing their faces (too much ‚Äì some morphing still happens). Nano Banana was better at capturing that cinematic lighting I wanted for the shots.\n\nI didn‚Äôt use Flux Context because characters‚Äô faces tend to get more and more inconsistent with each iteration.\n\nFor objects (e.g. the car, the knife, etc.), I‚Äôd say Seedream 4.0 was the best at keeping them mostly consistent, albeit imperfectly.  \n  \nI always had a ‚Äòbase‚Äô image for each character and object that I used as a reference whenever I wanted to insert them into a new scene. I tried to create the base images in different lighting scenarios (cinematic, horror, etc.) to place into scenes, in front view and side view. I didn't achieve perfect consistency but am overall happy with the results, save for a few shots.\n\nWith the characters, objects, and overall vibe set, the music video was basically a process of stitching scenes together bit by bit, with a lot of rolls (that‚Äôs where the costs added up). I used a lot of ‚Äúshaky camera‚Äù prompts because I think it helps counter the sometimes stiff AI camera angles and captures a raw, retro horror vibe better.\n\n**Struggles with the tech:**  \nThe biggest struggle was actually getting the axe to swing at the man‚Äôs neck at the right angle. That took a lot of effort and out-of-the-box thinking. When you write the prompt ‚Äúthe axe strikes the man‚Äôs neck,‚Äù for example, the AI video refuses to do it coherently ‚Äì probably due to safety issues. So I had to have a good raw image of the axe near the person‚Äôs neck, then use a prompt like ‚ÄúThe red object goes very near the person‚Äôs neck‚Äù and do manual video editing to capture the implication without being graphic.\n\nAI video can also be very hit-and-miss, so there was a lot of prompt refinement and trial-and-error to get a shot right. It wasn‚Äôt easy and was very frustrating at times. Some scenes started strong but got very wonky toward the end, so I had to use old-fashioned video editing to stitch them together.\n\n**Other tools I used:**\n\n* ElevenLabs ‚Äì for sound effects like footsteps, knife sounds, and the horror movie intro song\n* CapCut ‚Äì I use Premiere as well, but CapCut is generally easier for many tasks, though less powerful\n* Topaz Video AI ‚Äì I enhanced all shots to 4K and used video sharpening and AI detail enhancement\n* Astra (also by Topaz) ‚Äì I used it quite a bit, but it was too expensive and, to be honest, the results were very hit-and-miss\n\nHope this helps! Again, if you like the song, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could save it on [Spotify](https://linktw.in/NjCApW). It would mean a lot. Either way, I hope you enjoy the AI video! Thanks for watching - and happy trick-or-treating!\n\n¬†"

    "selftext": "I apologize if this has been previously posted or discussed but I came across a headline from 2021 that caught my eye. It reminded me of Blake Lively's emotionally manipulative texts to Justin Baldoni where she calls herself Khaleesi and talks about being overlooked and not being credited for her rewrites on prior films. \n\nNow I'm wondering if she was actually referring to Deadpool 2 and other films Ryan Reynolds was in where she felt like she was overlooked. That makes it feel even more manipulative and repugnant somehow. \n\nI might be reaching but I find it hard to believe that Ryan Reynolds felt bold and empowered enough to leak the Deadpool test footage to the public without the studio's knowledge or approval, push Tim Miller out, and take over the franchise.....but then he also had no say on whether or not Blake Lively could get credit for her alleged contributions.\n\nThis feels reminiscent of how Blake 'I don't know the word No' Girlboss Lively had the authority and power to renegotiate her contract and use it for leverage; banish Justin Baldoni to the basement; remove his Film By credit from the poster; and not just have her cut of the film made but have it actually be the one released in theaters....buuuuut she was too meek and disempowered to make formal HR complaints and/or notify SAG.\n\nAnd I know in the article, it made it seemed like Ryan Reynolds *tried* to get her credit but just *couldn't.* Now that we can see through their PR antics, to me it reads as a self-serving attempt to paint himself as a noble and supportive husband and champion of women, *while* *not actually doing anything* about it in any meaningful way even with the power, privilege, and position to do so. That particular theme also reminds me of [what happened with Marilyn Starkloff as recently reported by Eumonia Dike](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamjustinbaldoni/comments/1ofx8kq/article_ryan_reynolds_used_a_photographer_to/) and [alluded to by Marilyn herself](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamjustinbaldoni/comments/1oi920t/marilyn_starkloff_what_i_learned_the_hard_way_as/).\n\nHe was also a producer for all three Deadpool films, and their buddy Shawn Levy was the director and a producer for the third one. So when he says he informed the producers and directors of Blake's contributions but they didn't give her writing credit, is he calling Shawn Levy and the producers on those films, sexist? ü§î\n\nIs this just more retroactively twisting things to make himself look like the good guy *(see I advocated for my wife, they just didn't listen to me)* while also shifting blame onto everyone else *(it's their fault, they're the sexist and misogynistic ones)?* Or maybe both? I'm going to go with both. \n\n\\-----------\n\nThe article also mentions Ryan Reynolds being a 'girl dad'. Now that we've seen how he really is with his kids including exploiting and manipulating them into saying sexually explicit lines ---> ü§Æü§Æü§Æ\n\n‚ÄúI write on a lot of my movies. It‚Äôs been a survival mechanism for me for a long time.\" I suppose Ryan Reynolds could claim that writing the character and scenes for Nicepool including basing him on Justin Baldoni with all the mocking and taunting easter eggs, and then having him violently killed - is *just* for his survival. All his jokes punching down and made at the expenses of other people including his kids - that's also *just* for survival üôÑ\n\n\\-----------\n\nCredit goes to a commenter (outofideas) under one of BocceGoHawks' videos who posted a screencap of the headline that prompted me to go look for the article.\n\n[Article](https://www.marieclaire.com.au/news/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-movie-scripts-sexism/) follows below and as screencaps in the gallery. The last pic is a screencap of the Khaleesi text.  \n\n# Ryan Reynolds Blames ‚ÄúInherent Sexism‚Äù For Blake Lively Never Being Credited For Her Work In His Films\n\n**Ryan Reynolds has revealed that ‚Äúinherent sexism‚Äù in the film industry is the reason why his wife,¬†Blake Lively, has never received credit for writing a number of scripts for his most famous films.**\n\nWhile promoting his upcoming sci-fi comedy¬†*Free Guy,*¬†he continues to be questioned on the sequel of his most prolific film,¬†*Deadpool,*¬†and the upcoming third instalment of the franchise. But in particular, while in an¬†interview with¬†*SiriusXm,*¬†Reynolds called out the industry and its lack of ability to credit women who successfully contribute to its success.\n\n**He also added that the secret to his most successful films as a writer, specifically for his work on**¬†***Deadpool 2*****, was Lively, despite the public having no idea that she had any part in its construction.**\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs helped me so much in¬†*Deadpool*, all kinds of movies that have been big successes,‚Äù¬†Reynolds¬†said, adding that Lively is a ‚Äúreally talented,¬†multi-hyphenate¬†kind of person.‚Äù\n\n[](https://www.instagram.com/p/COp7XKlB3gz/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=cadd7455-dc19-4211-a7eb-e4fb2df4ed89)\n\nReynolds‚Äô continued by admitting that his best contributions as a writer, typically come from Lively herself, saying:\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of A++ writing that I‚Äôve done that was actually Blake; Blake would jump in, grab the keyboard and \\[say\\] ‚ÄòWhat about this?‚Äô And I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs incredible‚Äô.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs helped me so much in ‚ÄòDeadpool,‚Äô all kinds of movies that have been big successes,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always got a lot of bricks in that wall.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI write on a lot of my movies. It‚Äôs been a survival mechanism for me for a long time. Sometimes I‚Äôm credited, sometimes I‚Äôm not.‚Äù\n\n**The father of three also revealed that he would inform directors and producers of Lively‚Äôs vital contribution to their scripts, but the credit always ends up going to him.**\n\n**‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs cause there‚Äôs inherent sexism in the business,‚Äù Reynolds said. ‚ÄúI will say that a lot of times, ‚ÄòShe wrote that, Blake wrote that not me. That was her.‚Äô And it‚Äôs like, they still, later on, repeat the story as ‚ÄòI wrote it.‚Äô‚Äù**\n\nThe notoriously private father of three went on to talk about his life as a ‚Äúgirl dad‚Äù to his and Lively‚Äôs daughters: James, Inez and Betty.\n\nAside from being the children of Hollywood‚Äôs most talked-about couples, the trio also had the honour of being named in one of Taylor Swift‚Äôs songs,[¬†](https://www.marieclaire.com.au/news/celebrity/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-betty-baby-name/)titled \"Betty\". Now, over a year after the song‚Äôs initial release, Reynolds has spoken about his thoughts on his daughters‚Äô song mention.\n\n‚ÄúThe names are the name of our kids, but, you know, we trust \\[Taylor\\] implicitly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very sensitive to any of that stuff. And obviously the song had nothing to do with our kids other than our kids‚Äô names,‚Äù\n\nAdding that he and Lively think the song is ‚Äúpretty damn amazing‚Äù, the storyline within the tune details a complicated love triangle between three highschoolers, who are named after the couple‚Äôs children.\n\n‚ÄúWhat an honour. We thought it was pretty, pretty damn amazing. We still do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou know, I still walk down the street and shake my head thinking, I can‚Äôt believe that happened.‚Äù"

    "selftext": "Prompt:\n\nThe Claymation Coffee Vista - Morning Genesis. Visual and Art Direction (for the entire clip): Craft a scene in the distinct style of classic stop-motion claymation, emphasizing a subtly 'step-frame' or 'jerky' animation quality rather than smooth motion, to enhance the handcrafted feel. Feature matte, handmade textures and subtle fingerprints visible on all surfaces, giving it a tangible, sculpted feel. Utilize a diverse, slightly desaturated, yet clearly distinct and balanced color palette. Incorporate rich, deep browns for the coffee, earthy tones and creams for the cup, lush greens, blues, and muted yellows/oranges for the sprawling natural vista (mountains, forests, sky). Avoid a monochromatic look; ensure clear color separation and vibrancy suitable for classic claymation. Lighting should be soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows, to emphasize the sculpted forms. The overall atmosphere should be charmingly imperfect, handcrafted, and grounded, highlighting the material's malleability and the tactile nature of clay. Audio Directive: No music is to be added to this clip. The audio should consist solely of satisfying, exaggerated claymation sound effects ‚Äì squishing, stretching, settling, gentle bubbling/pouring sounds, and subtle ambient nature sounds (e.g., distant birds, soft breeze). Episode Flow (One Continuous Shot Description): Description: A continuous, wide, static shot from a slightly elevated perspective, overlooking a stunning, expansive claymation natural vista (e.g., rolling mountains, dense forests, a winding river, all rendered in textured clay). In the foreground, there's a simple, flat, textured clay surface (like a rock ledge or a wooden table edge) perfectly positioned to enjoy the view. The background features a vast, textured clay sky with soft, muted clouds. The focus is initially on the empty foreground ledge. The animation within the clip should subtly convey a stop-motion feel. Phase 1 (Initial State - Empty Ledge & Vista): The shot begins with the empty claymation ledge in the foreground, with the beautiful, untouched claymation vista stretching out behind it. Phase 2 (Coffee Cup Emergence & Steam Formation): From the center of the foreground ledge, lumps and forms of clay rapidly begin to rise, flow, and expand upwards. This emerging form organically stretches, twists, and sculpts itself with remarkable elasticity and fluidity, quickly forming a detailed claymation coffee cup (e.g., in cream or earthy tones) complete with a handle. As the cup solidifies, a rich, dark brown clay liquid (the coffee) organically fills it. Immediately, subtle, translucent, wispy forms of white or light grey clay begin to gently rise and curl above the coffee, representing steaming vapor that dynamically forms and dissipates in the stop-motion style. The cup and coffee grow vertically through this dynamic, flowing movement, its diverse colors and details appearing as the clay stretches and solidifies into shape. The accompanying sound effects are satisfying squishes, stretches, and a gentle bubbling/filling sound. Phase 3 (Final State - Fully Formed Coffee & Steam): The magnificent claymation steaming cup of coffee stands fully formed and detailed on the ledge. The cup is perfectly sculpted, filled with rich brown clay coffee, and delicate, wispy clay steam curls convincingly above it. It proudly overlooks the stunning claymation natural vista, showcasing a rich, diverse, yet desaturated color palette. Visible clay textures are prominent, as if it has just finished organically growing and assembling itself. The final audio settles into subtle ambient nature sounds, perhaps a soft, gentle breeze."

    "selftext": "Apologies in advance for the length of this...  \n  \nI'm wanting to get some clarity on whether we're allowed to give the Vine items we obtain away  \n\\- During the first 6 months after review. (I'm not clear)  \n\\- 6 months or more after review. (I think at this point we can do what we want with it)\n\nOf course I'm already picking up stuff for my wife and kids who live with me. From what I can tell we all do that. I'm mostly thinking of family like my mother who does not live in the same household, but possibly also close friends. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that I understand Vine Australia is not the same as Vine in any other country. Some countries like the US pay tax on Vine items. Others don't etc. So \n\nOn the US Reddit group there is a quote from a couple of years ago:\n\n\"Per the¬†[Amazon Vine Terms and Conditions](https://www.amazon.com/vine/terms?rw_useCurrentProtocol=1&pf_rd_p=1cb6de54-5638-4b6b-8199-cdf70bc86618&pf_rd_r=5K37J3BZGZDKGJWCVJC8&ref_=amb_link_NTXvRb4MNXOsS7Xq9x5Zwg_2), you may not sell or give possession of the products to any other person or entity for six months following your order.\"\n\nI'm not seeing any such thing on our terms. What I am seeing on the Australian Vine agreement:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com.au/vine/terms](https://www.amazon.com.au/vine/terms)\n\n\"for six months following your review of any Third-Party Product, return any Third-Party Product and any information relating to them to Amazon promptly upon request (this requirement does not apply to Amazon Products)\"  \n  \n...which isn't really a problem. First I can let the person know that it's possible I may be asked for it back and  have to collect it quickly. I have to let them know there's no warranty anyway. Second I've only ever heard of the product being requested for return under exception circumstances.\n\n...and...\n\n\" and not delegate to anyone else the opportunity to write or submit an Amazon Vine review.\"\n\n...also no problem as I wouldn't give it away until I had reviewed it, or possibly I'd review with the person I'm gifting to present.\n\nThere is also:\n\n\"Disposal of Vine Products\n\nAll right, title and interest in the Amazon Products will pass to you when the Amazon Product is delivered to the common carrier for delivery to you\"\n\n...which kinda conflicts with them being able to ask for it back, but I presume this means them asking for it back is an exception.\n\nI'd love to ask Vine support, but as you know we get no answers from them.\n\nAlso how do you guys feel about people picking up gifts, when it could mean other Vine members miss out?"
