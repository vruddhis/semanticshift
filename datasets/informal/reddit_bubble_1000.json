I dont know the exact specifics of his numbers but he seems like a better invisible almost if used right and I consider invisible the most balanced support by far.\n\nHis healing is great on both from what ive seen just based off the stream which he can use to heal the whole from afar much better than rocket can while dealing good damage poke damage to the enemy. Really the amount of damage he can just passively do gets underrated around here in my opinion, its actually insane the pressure that comes from it. If you've ever frontlined on tank or a DPS like wolverine or iron fist you'll know what im talking about. It even hits people around corners and behind walls for some reason. So, kinda like luna he can heal Flankers and divers from his own backline or even a mile behind his own backline it seems.\n\nHis bubbles he can leave around and shoot for speed boost and some overtime healing further helping heal any divers or Flanders getting out and coming back.\n\nTrying to dive or even simply get on him is a pain even when he separates himself which alot of Jeff's do cause he can just bubble himself and dive. Making him a pain to hit, faster, self healing, and he can go up walls. It doesnt even falther his healing cause of his range, he can quickly pop up heal and go back under. Seems like you need poke to really pressure him in any meaningful way but ngl I'm really tired of poke being the answer but that's a me thing.\n\nHis ult wasnt ever that bad just high risk high reward and most players sucked with it but now its not. He can completely make groot, strange, and thing ults irrelevant by swallowing his team or just leaving the circle of healing on them and swallowing the others team trying to captilze. The healing circle also helps people now survive other DPS ults like starlords which it didnt before.\n\nDont even get me started on triple support where he transcends nearly to the levels of server admin.\n\nMaybe I'm tripping and slightly tilted from a klyntar payload match but Jeff is starting to look slightly overturned and just a better invis.

    "selftext": "**CNN Fact-Check Dismantles Trump’s Boast of ‘Highest Ever’ Support**\n\nTrump recently returned to a familiar talking point, asserting this week that he enjoys not only the highest personal approval ratings of his career but also the best numbers of any modern president. However, a sharp fact-check from CNN’s Daniel Dale quickly exposed the claims as baseless, revealing that the Trump’s popularity has, in fact, declined significantly since the beginning of his second term.\n\nData compiled across multiple authoritative polling averages confirms that Trump’s current standing is nowhere near his previous high points and is historically weak compared to his predecessors.\n\n**The Numbers Don’t Lie: A Post-Inauguration Nosedive**\n\nTrump boasted, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had,” and claimed to possess “the best numbers for any president in many years.” The reality, according to independent data, paints a dramatically different picture:\n\n* **The Decline**: Polling averages show a marked decline in support since January. The New York Times average, as of the reporting date, placed Trump's approval at 43%, with a net disapproval of minus-11 points. This marks a sharp 20-point drop in net approval since the first week of his term, when his net approval was +9 (52% approval).\n\n* **Wider Averages**: CNN’s own \"Poll of Polls\" confirmed this trend, registering Trump’s net approval even lower at negative-15 points (41% approval, 56% disapproval). Similarly, polling experts G. Elliott Morris and Nate Silver tracked net approval in the negative-10 to negative-14 range, representing drops of 22 to 26 points since the start of the year.\n\nWhile Trump’s base support within the Republican Party remains robustly in the 90s, his overall national appeal—the metric he referenced—is clearly weakening.\n\n***A Historical Anomaly**\n\nThe current low standing for Trump also fails to meet the peak popularity achieved by his immediate predecessors. The claim of having \"the best numbers for any president\" collapses under historical scrutiny:\n\n* **Past Peaks**: Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both hit approval ratings of 57% or higher in the early days of their terms. President George W. Bush reached an extraordinary 90% approval following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n* **The Bottom of the Chart**: The data is stark: every U.S. President elected after World War II enjoyed better poll numbers than Trump at the equivalent point in their first term, based on both net approval and total approval figures.\n\nThe wide margin between Trump's current net disapproval (around -10 to -15 points) and the net approval of predecessors like Ronald Reagan (+20) or John F. Kennedy (+65) at a similar point in their tenure underscores the inaccuracy of his claims.\n\nUltimately, the data suggests that Trump’s assertion of \"record popularity\" is an artifact that exists solely within his political rhetoric, completely unverified by objective national polling.\n\nTrump's repeated insistence that his popularity is at its \"highest ever\" and \"best... for any president,\" despite contrary polling data, is a textbook manifestation of a cognitive and personality trait known as the Narcissistic Illusion of Grandiosity.\n\nThis concept is central to Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and refers to a persistent, unrealistic belief in one's own superiority, exceptionality, and limitless success, often maintained by distorting or outright dismissing contradictory external evidence.\n\n**Here is an analysis of how this illusion plays out in the context of the reported polling claims**:\n\n**1. The Core Mechanism: Denial of Contradictory Evidence**\n\nThe fundamental operation of this illusion is the rejection of any information that challenges the inflated self-image.\n\n* **Behavior**: When presented with multiple, non-partisan polling averages (CNN, NYT, Silver) showing a net disapproval rating in the double digits, Trump simply asserts the opposite: \"I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.\"\n\n* **Analysis**: This is not a simple misstatement or spin; it is a failure to process reality that conflicts with the internal self-narrative. The polling data, which suggests he is not universally loved, is perceived as a threat to his grandiosity and is therefore automatically rejected and replaced with an invented \"fact\" of success.\n\n**2. Grandiosity Through Comparative Superiority**\n\nNarcissistic grandiosity often requires not just success, but superiority over all rivals.\n\n* **Behavior**: Trump claims he has \"the best numbers for any president in many years.\" The article shows that every single post-WWII president had higher numbers at the equivalent point in their term.\n\n* **Analysis**: The illusion compels him to claim a historical dominance that the facts do not support. To maintain his self-image, he must be \"better\" than Obama, Bush, Clinton, and even Kennedy. The external reality (which shows him at the bottom of the list) is intolerable because it places him beneath others, shattering the illusion of being an exceptional president.\n\n**3. The Creation of an Alternate Reality (The \"Echo Chamber\")**\n\nIndividuals with this illusion often rely on selective data and echo chambers to validate their claims, which reinforces the bias.\n\n* **Behavior**: Trump’s popularity among the Republican base remains \"sky-high—often in the 90s.\"\n\n* **Analysis**: The high internal party support serves as the narcissistic fuel. He selectively amplifies the data from his base, treating it as the entirety of national opinion. The distinction between GOP approval (positive) and National approval (negative) is deliberately blurred because his grandiosity cannot accept the existence of a hostile majority. By focusing exclusively on the positive data within his bubble, he constructs an alternate reality where his claim of universal love is true.\n\n**4. Lack of Empathy and External Validation Seeking**\n\nThe illusion of grandiosity is sustained by a continuous need for admiration and an inability to understand the impact of his behavior on others (or on the polls).\n\n* **Behavior**: He makes the claims public, with an air of absolute certainty.\n\n* **Analysis**: This is a move to seek external validation for his internal, grand idea of himself. He speaks the fantasy aloud, expecting his audience to affirm it. The claim itself, being self-aggrandizing and easily disproven, is characteristic of the relentless and sometimes desperate need for admiration that fuels the narcissistic cycle.\n\nIn sum, Trump's reaction to the unfavorable polls illustrates the defense mechanism of the Narcissistic Illusion of Grandiosity: facts that support the self-image are embraced as gospel, while facts that challenge it are not just denied, but actively replaced with an invented, more glorious reality."

However, something felt so off about it. They never replied to me about the missed appointment, the co-pay charge went through... etc.   \n  \nAfter not hearing from them for 24 hours, I messaged the office. **The office let me know initially they couldn't find my therapist.** They sent a follow up email that they had **\"gained information\"** about my therapist and would be assigning her clients new providers. This led to a lot of anxiety on my end.   \n  \nI feel SO guilty because I feel something was wrong with my therapist in our last session. She is genuinely so bubbly and full of life. She just looked SO sad in our last session. It was something I have not seen before. \n\nSaying they couldn't find her made me very emotional based on our last appointment. They put me with someone new at the same practice, and that therapist did finally tell me my therapist was alive but did not know any other information. (All I wanted to know was if they were alive, the rest is NONE of my business, so I am finding peace in knowing they are still on the planet). \n\nFew Questions: \n\n**1. Is it normal to not want to go back to therapy after this, especially in the same office?** There are very few that specialize in PTSD in my area so I stayed with the same practice because they could get me in this week. \n\nI almost want to walk away from therapy, but I have been in therapy for 10 years and it has helped me keep my life together. \n\nI also don't want to open up again, in case this happens again. Will a therapist understand my hesitance to open back up? My last therapist was very comforting and I could tell her everything. I was 100% honest with this therapist. I felt safe.  Opening up was very organic, I really didn't even have time to think about closing off. \n\nSecond question (for therapist only): \n\n**2. Is it ok to make my previous therapist a card and just thank them for our time?** I'm very saddened our time was cut short, **but the most important thing is they are alive.** I do not want to make them sad due to the way things ended, but want to emphasize how much of a contribution they were to my progress. **Would a therapist like this? Or would it hurt them?** \n\n3. If you are worried about your therapist, what is the client course of action to take? Maybe if I had reached out to someone right after our session, someone could have checked on her. I understand this is misplaced guilt on my end, but I can't help it right now.   \n  \nThank you for reading and I truly appreciate your time and your response. "

    "selftext": "Every time, when I am about to invest in an AI related pennystock, I hesitate for a moment.\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, it basically means the hype and money around AI finally crash back down to reality. Right now, companies are spending crazy amounts on AI projects, chips, and data centers, even though many of them aren’t actually making much money from it yet. \n\nAt some point — maybe soon, investors might realize the profits aren’t matching the promises. When that happens, stock prices could drop fast, startups might shut down, and a lot of people who jumped on the AI trend could lose money. But it won’t mean AI is dead — it’ll just mean the overhyped part is gone, and what’s left will be the real, useful stuff that actually works.\n\n\n"

Some help with mod recs?\n\nA few things I want:\n\n* I'm not a big fan of the steep leveling. Would prefer something \"flatter\", where your level, enemy level, and the level of your gear don't matter as much as the skills you've got and how you use them. For reference I really liked how Cyberpunk 2.0 handles levels - early game guns don't feel useless too quickly, they're still lethal weapons, you just find better stuff as you go that kills a bit quicker and synergizes better with your playstyle.\n* Related to the above, I am considering playing on NG+ from my old 100% save, because I find it makes the experience a bit more immersive not having to worry about gear and leveling as much. Good idea, or worth doing an NG playthrough to see how it plays now?\n* I've never tried any \"restored content\" mods. I know CDPR already restored some stuff with the next gen update, but are there mods still worth using to see even more cut quests/etc?\n* I want a few more skill slots. I remember using \"Slots slots slots\" in the past - is that still functional/next-gen compatible?\n* OR, I want certain skills to just be passive/always on once unlocked. Specifically, it bugs me that some of Geralt's \"canon\" abilities (like axii delusion for dialogues, the quen bubble and alternate igni, which are both used in cutscenes, and arrow deflection, which he does numerous times in the books) require slotted perks to be usable. Also whirl and rend, because more variation in melee attacks just makes combat more fun. Some of those are objectively wastes of slots in a \"proper\" optimized build in vanilla, but I want to have them on anyway.\n* Anything else that makes the gameplay more immersive and/or more similar to Geralt from the books.

    "selftext": "So it's pretty well-established that conventional aquarium filters are a bit of a no-go for leeches, as they can work their way into places that aren't exactly hospitable. As I'd recently upgraded to a big ol' 60l tank, I wanted some way to maintain the water quality in addition to the plants and regular water changes. I'd heard of a few people using sponge filters or air stones, and wanted to do something similar in my Deluxe Leech Zone and have cooked up a solution that's not quite one or the other, and I figured I'd share the result as it might help some of y'all out!\n\nFull disclosure, I didn't come up with this entirely myself, had some help from the fantastic people at my local aquatics store - it's been awesome finding some local people who're interested in my bizarre little worms.\n\nThe Equipment:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sz1f0ngchyf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7044dab3c75522da1dc294bde92523084be2768\n\nLong air stone, with two filter sponges wrapped around the outside. The idea is, you can 'clean' them one at a time so you don't damage all of the good filter bacteria any time you need to de-gunk it. A tip I got for this is to 'rinse' them by taking them off the air stone and squeezing them in the water removed when doing a water change (not fresh or tap water!), which should remove any debris but minimise the impact on the bacteria.\n\nThe rest is standard bits: PVC tube for the airflow, an air control valve, and an appropriately sized air pump - this'll vary depending on the size of the aquarium and how vigorous you want the water flow, for leeches I'd keep it on the gentler side. The air control valve helps a lot with modulating the intensity too, I've got it so it bubbles relatively little/gently so as not to disturb them.\n\nAssembly is pretty straightforward, the filter sponges wrap perfectly around the air stone (you may need to be more creative depending on what you've got) and the rest is cutting the tube for the air control and check valves before sticking it all together. Then just position the stone as you'd like in the tank, fit the tubing around whatever leech-proofing methods employed, and switch that baby on. Use the control valve to adjust it until you're happy with the flow rate, and you're good to go.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jyeslsivdhyf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=398c803711cea36d2cd9b96fedd1344ee858c730\n\nThe valve situation should look something like this, always use a check valve if the pump's not above the tank to prevent water backflow.\n\nHere's the finished contraption in action:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d0crln2ehyf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c447c24d98fe8f24ae6bb9ddd2611afe1a84e741\n\nGiven that one of them immediately went and plonked itself on the glass next to the filter, they don't seem to mind it in the least.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zam8jn2ehyf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45817b0f181be2289f4e149613b0617fc17eb3c2\n\n"

    "selftext": "\n\nWe saw a move into the 130’s which was a good sign.  It didn’t have massive resistance as it seemed to pass pretty easily up to the 131.99 before starting to trickle back down.  We are still at a relatively low volume so the subtle motion being able to hold an upward momentum is a good sign.   The wider range of AI stocks have all reported relatively good numbers signaling a positive sentiment in the overall market for future growth. \n\nThis all plays well into our buildup for earning.  I’m not concerned if we miss the 135 target for today while the market is open. The fact we got right up to 132 without major push of large drop after is a great sign.  I am watching for the after hours today and continuing momentum into premarket on Monday to be right around the 135 range.  \n\nAs we get into next week we should see some big news.  One of the news stories that I am looking for is a US budget agreement.  If this is short term it will have a good impact of this is an agreement to get through most of 1026 it will have a much bigger impact on the market and it’s buying pressure.  I think we see a longer term agreement with what’s happening right now in the political landscape.  \n\nGood news likes good news so as we start to reel through next week I will be watching for a break out above 140 mid to late week. In this area we will see a lot more volume. Selling pressure will rise as millions of shares hit the 75-+100% profit areas again.  The buying pressure will rise because they have seen this stock run up many times and it’s always possible that it finds a new much higher support line.  (This isn’t how I trade it’s how many people trade).  People who truly swing trade like to see big volume and motion.  The fundamentals matter far less so traders start to flock towards a hot stock.  This adds to the momentum and the volatility. \n\nAs we exit Fridays trading market I’m looking for a 145-150 price target.   This makes Monday quite fun as we will see CRWV announce its earnings and regardless of what they report I think it’s a positive spin for NBIS and adds excitement to the earning.  If CRWV comes in short I think more investors swing from there to NBIS as we saw last time. If they have a great report I think the sentiment that this AI market has much more to offer than what those trying to signal a bubble have portrayed.  \n\nIn a big earnings win we will see 167 million.  This is a great earnings beat and I think we get a good bump from this target area. I believe it’s poss to see number much closer to the 200 mark or above.  If we get the 200 or above I think we see a solid run at the $200 share price.  Depending on what other news is released with earning we may see a very strong move into the 200’s.  \n\nAs we get closer I continue to watch and wait with great excitement and anticipation.  I’m so happy and blessed right now. Thanks for\nall the prayers it looks like I am on track to get my truck fixed.  My family is still hanging in there.  \n\nI want to add that I will be closing the 114 Nov call as I have mentioned multiple times now because I need to help family and God as blessed me with enough of a gain on this single call to take care of what needs to be taken care of. \n\nThank you all for following along. As always I consider each and every one of you as part of my extended greater family and stay in my mind and prayers with every prayer I pray. God bless you my friends "

For example: like making sure the child hates me because I have kept the father from seeing the child…. Never have I once said anything in the sorts to “keeping” him away from the child. I have stopped responding period and haven’t responded in 6 years. I do not believe that I need to respond to narcissistic messages. Sometimes I will get 1 text a year. Sometimes I will get 2 or 3 depending on I guess how guilty he is feeling. I quit responding due to some things going on when my child was going over for visitation that were not sitting right with my “insides”. The father would always make sure to remind me that he is the father, but as far as co-parenting. Even tho I had the child every night, provided drop off to school and everything, etc. the father would act like my 2 cents weren’t valid because again… He is the father and only that matters. \n\nHe has never shown up to my house. I have not moved since the divorce. Am in the same place \n\nI guess what I’m asking is, am I in violation? Am I risking my child’s safety because I believe I am removing my child from an unsafe environment that is potentially emotionally and mentally unstable for him. No I don’t suspect physical abuse. But when my child was going for visitation, there was a change when they would come back. Almost zombie like. Not the bubbly child I am used too. Even at a young age, the child did not want to go. And would scream and cry at drop offs. \n\nI love my child very much. And fully believe I am protecting them from a narcissistic parent. But part of me wonders if the father will use me not responding as “leverage”??? Even tho I haven’t ever said “No you can’t see him” or what ever- because again. I just stopped responding. I stopped coparenting on the father’s behalf and trying to make it work and now I just get random messages when he remembers. \n\nI think I’m typing in circles.

    "selftext": "Confession time. I've had a notes app idea sitting in my notion for 2 years. Every few months I'd open it, read through my plans, feel motivated for 10 minutes, then close it and do nothing.\n\nThe main blocker was thinking I needed to become an ios development expert first. like I needed to understand every detail of xcode, swift, the whole ecosystem before i could start. classic analysis paralysis.\n\ntwo weeks ago something clicked and I decided to just build it using whatever tools would get me there fastest.\n\nStuff I tried:\n\n- bubble: too limited for what i wanted, felt more web than app\n- flutterflow: actually pretty good but the exported code was messy\n- adalo: nice ui but performance was bad on device\n- thunkable: similar issues, felt clunky\n\nEnded up going the ai-assisted native route instead. used cursor with claude for generating swiftui code, watched youtube tutorials for specific features, stack overflow when things broke.\n\nThe interesting find was supervibes which is this new vibecoding tool someone made specifically for swift. it's a native mac app that can build straight to your phone without being in xcode constantly. has starter templates with basic app structure already set up which saved me from the \"blank canvas paralysis\" problem. still pretty new and not perfect but helped me actually ship instead of tweaking forever.\n\nwhat the app does:\n\n- create/edit notes (shocking i know)\n- basic categories and tags\n- icloud sync that actually works\n- dark mode because it's 2025\n- nothing fancy but it does what i imagined\n\nI spent maybe 12 hours over 4 days. submitted Thursday, approved saturday.\n\ncurrent stats: 0 downloads except my mom and 2 friends who I forced to install it. not making money. not gonna pretend this is some success story.\n\nbut here's the thing. it exists. after 2 years of \"someday\" it's a real app that anyone can download.\n\nTo me:\n\n- shipping mediocre is better than perfecting nothing\n- the technical barrier is way lower than 5 years ago\n- you don't need to be an expert to start\n- ai tools are good enough now that you can just build stuff\n- overthinking kills more projects than bad execution\n- native apps feel better than nocode wrappers\n\nresources that actually helped:\n\n- paul hudson's free swiftui tutorials\n- kavsoft youtube channel for ui patterns\n- stack overflow (obviously)\n- reddit threads in r/iosprogramming\n- honestly just starting and figuring it out as i went\n\nIf you've been sitting on an app idea for months, seriously just try building something this weekend. doesn't have to be perfect. doesn't have to make money. just has to exist.\n\nWhat's stopping you? genuine question because i used the same excuses for 2 years and they were all bullshit."

    "selftext": "The data for this week’s rankings comes from scraping six of the most active cannabis subreddits, with AI used to analyze sentiment. Upvotes, downvotes, and comments are combined into a trend score — our measure of the attention a product is receiving. Keep in mind that these brands make the list for both good and bad reasons.\n\nWe sum trend scores by brand to show which names are hottest right now on **BudTrendz**, updating every four hours. 🔥 indicates positive sentiment, 💩 means negative, and the double arrow 🔄 shows neutral sentiment. A brand with mixed emojis has both positive and negative chatter — for instance, one 💩 and one 🔥 means mixed reviews, while four 🔥 means they’re clearly winning the week.\n\nWe repeat this every week, helping you see what’s gaining traction across Canada’s cannabis scene. Here are the top ten brands heading into the Halloween weekend.\n\n# 1. Cannabis Cartel 💩 112\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 1 | **Sentiment Summary:** Cannabis Cartel makes its debut at the top this week — but not for good reasons. The single review was overwhelmingly negative, earning a lone 💩 and comparisons to the notorious M39.\n\n**Cannabis Cartel – GSC**   \nReviewer: u/Basic-Lasik   \nThe reviewer calls this product “the spiritual successor to M39,” warning others to avoid it. They cite inflated THC claims, UV degradation, and a high price of $41 for 3.5g, concluding that it’s poor value and disappointing quality.\n\n# 2. Tenzo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 110\n\n**Trending Products:** 4 | **Reviewers:** 4 | **Sentiment Summary:** Tenzo continues its hot streak, appearing in the top three for the third straight week. This time it’s the **new Espresso Gelato** that’s driving buzz. Consumers praise its appearance, flavour, and potency, earning Tenzo six 🔥 this round.\n\n* **Tenzo – Big Smallz Cookies Gelato Yahemi** Reviewer: u/lahpsy  Praised for strong effects and rich taste, though the small nug size made it less ideal for productivity. The reviewer recommends it as a great “wind-down” option.\n* **Tenzo – Espresso Gelato** Reviewer: u/Awkward-Will-8824  A standout new drop. The reviewer loved its aroma, transparent packaging, and powerful effects. They note it’s pricey but worth every dollar.\n* **Tenzo – Big Smallz (Ice Cream Cake)** Reviewer: u/Classic-Two1464  Another repeat hit for Tenzo. This batch matched the quality of earlier ones, delivering solid taste and value at $82 for 14g.\n* **Tenzo – 97 Octane Smalls (Black Caviar)** Reviewer: u/Maryjanegangafever  The reviewer enjoyed its berry aroma, smooth high, and reusable jar packaging, calling it a solid buy and planning to repurchase.\n\n# 3. Amani Craft 💩🔥 84\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 2 | **Sentiment Summary:** Amani Craft returns to the top three with mixed feedback. One reviewer praised the cure and flavour, while another had the opposite experience, earning the brand both 💩 and 🔥 this week.\n\n* **Amani Craft – Gastro Pop** Reviewer: u/Nature_Sad_27 Found the taste “like rotting wet spinach,” blaming a bad cure and expressing disappointment in the overall quality.  Reviewer: u/great_kayak_11 Loved the product’s moist interior and perfect cure, describing it as a “donut with a frosted shell.” They’re eager for future drops despite its rarity.\n\n# 4. North of 28 Premium Craft 💩 76\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 1 | **Sentiment Summary:** Possibly their first time on the list — and not for positive reasons. North of 28 earns a single 💩 this week following a poor user experience.\n\n* **North of 28 Premium Craft (Unnamed Product)** Reviewer: u/Maryjanegangafever  Described as “mids” with musty smell and weak effects. The reviewer found a cardboard business card in the bag and reported sore throat after smoking. They won’t be repurchasing.\n\n# 5. u/TheLegacyMarket 🔥🔄🔥 44\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 1 | **Sentiment Summary:** A rare appearance from The Legacy Market on the list. One post shared across three subreddits helped them land in fifth, earning mixed but mostly positive sentiment.\n\n* **The Legacy Market – Jet Fuel** Reviewer: u/Extra_Ad6930  Across multiple subreddits, this reviewer praised the slow burn, creamy-gas flavour, and nice cure. Though they wished for stronger gas notes, they were impressed by the quality of year-old flower and white ash.\n\n# 6. Broken Coast 🔥🔥🔥🔥 38\n\n**Trending Products:** 4 | **Reviewers:** 2 | **Sentiment Summary:** Broken Coast continues to impress with four 🔥 reviews and rising chatter. Consumers highlight aroma, structure, and smooth burn across several strains.\n\n* **Broken Coast – Platinum Pave**  Reviewer: u/Unlikely_Bear_6531  Sticky buds, clean burn, and heavy indica effects. Rated 9/10 and described as great quality.\n* **Broken Coast – EmergenZ**  Reviewer: u/IndependentRatio7633  Highly praised for scent and potency, with frosty, large nugs. Compared favourably to White Hot Guava and recommended for medical use.\n* **Broken Coast – Jet Fuel Gelato** Reviewer: u/IndependentRatio7633  Called “absolute fire,” this strain impressed with strong flavour and compassionate pricing.\n* **Broken Coast – Pineapple Marker #143** Reviewer: u/IndependentRatio7633 Sticky trichomes and standout taste made this a must-try. The reviewer plans to buy again.\n\n# 7. Sixty Seven Sins 💩🔥🔥💩 37\n\n**Trending Products:** 3 | **Reviewers:** 2 | **Sentiment Summary:** Mixed week for Sixty Seven Sins. Two 🔥 and two 💩 balance out to a split showing, with u/DougFromWpg weighing in on both ends.\n\n* **Sixty Seven Sins – Gas Face** Reviewer: u/DougFromWpg Disappointed by musty flavour and harsh vape experience, suggesting a curing issue.\n* **Sixty Seven Sins – Fishy Fingers** Reviewer: u/DougFromWpg Found this one delicious and well-balanced with a functional hybrid buzz, though disliked the name.\n* **Sixty Seven Sins – Expo 67 Kush Sorbet** Reviewer: u/p1ngmantoo Reported an underweight package but noted this isn’t typical of the brand.\n\n# 8. Tribal 🔥💩 36\n\n**Trending Products:** 2 | **Reviewers:** 2 | **Sentiment Summary:** Tribal lands at eighth with one positive and one negative review — solid products but some reliability issues.\n\n* **Tribal – Porto Leche FSE** Reviewer: u/Forgraver Enjoyed the terpene-rich taste and effects, preferring it to bubble resin versions.\n* **Tribal – Triple Burger Cart** Reviewer: u/NearbyBaker4597 Liked the effects but reported leaking carts, suggesting a switch to another brand.\n\n# 9. Wildcard Extracts 🔥 35\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 1 | **Sentiment Summary:** Wildcard doesn’t show up often, but when it does, it’s for quality.\n\n* **Wildcard Extracts – Forbidden Pie Small Batch Live Resin** Reviewer: u/pjbth Despite a finicky cart, the reviewer loved the floaty high and clean effects, calling it one of their top ten carts overall.\n\n# 10. The Kitchen 💩 31\n\n**Trending Products:** 1 | **Reviewers:** 1 | **Sentiment Summary:** New to the list this week, The Kitchen lands in tenth with a single 💩 review for its Kadillac Rainbow strain.\n\n* **The Kitchen – Kadillac Rainbow** Reviewer: u/MrTreezx Too dry with little aroma or flavour, though the high was acceptable. The reviewer questioned the “gourmet” branding and overall value.\n\nThat’s a wrap for this week’s **Hot Canadian Cannabis Products for the Weekend of October 31, 2025**.\n\nTenzo’s new *Espresso Gelato* continues to earn praise, while Cannabis Cartel’s *GSC* stirred up strong criticism. Whether it’s 🔥 or 💩, every review helps shape the pulse of Canada’s cannabis conversation — and BudTrendz tracks it all.\n\nTL;DR\n\n|**Rank**|**Brand**|**🔥/💩**|**Products**|**Reviewers**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Cannabis Cartel|💩|GSC|1|Overpriced, low-quality|\n|2|Tenzo|🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥|Big Smallz Cookies Gelato Yahemi, Espresso Gelato, Big Smallz Ice Cream Cake, 97 Octane Smalls|4|Loved for taste, aroma, and effects; new Espresso Gelato praised|\n|3|Amani Craft|💩🔥|Gastro Pop|2|Mixed reviews; one loved it, one disliked taste|\n|4|North of 28|💩|Flower|1|Weak effects, musty taste|\n|5|The Legacy Market|🔥🔄🔥|Jet Fuel|1|High quality despite age; slow burn and creamy-gas taste|\n|6|Broken Coast|🔥🔥🔥🔥|Platinum Pave, EmergenZ, Jet Fuel Gelato, Pineapple Marker #143|2|Strong aroma, potency, smooth burn|\n|7|67 Sins|💩🔥🔥💩|Gas Face, Fishy Fingers, Expo 67 Kush Sorbet|2|Mixed sentiment; some loved flavour, others reported issues|\n|8|Tribal|🔥💩|Porto Leche FSE, Triple Burger|2|One praised taste, one reported leaking carts|\n|9|Wildcard|🔥|Forbidden Pie Small Batch Live Resin|1|Floaty high, clear effects; cart finicky|\n|10|The Kitchen|💩|Kadillac Rainbow|1|Dry, lacking flavour; high decent but overpriced|\n\n[https://budtrendz.com/blog/hot-canadian-cannabis-products-for-the-weekend-of-october-31-2025/](https://budtrendz.com/blog/hot-canadian-cannabis-products-for-the-weekend-of-october-31-2025/)"

    "selftext": "Hi, this is a theory on why I think Guns path could be similar to zenkai boost from DB;I've broken down why I believe this into **3** pieces of evidence (photos).\n\n1. His training method:  while he was in prison he fought hundreds of prisoners everyday to get stronger. While you could just consider this a form of total body workout I believe this could be more when paired with the other evidence\n\n2. The Hint from MK: the speech bubbles imply that Guns path has something to do with his body, now I've seen others interpret this as him just getting a hardened body but I think thats too simple. MKs words imply that Guns body is a byproduct of his path and not his path its self. I believe due to Gun always fighting his body has adapted in a way to maximize growth under those conditions similar to a zenkai.\n\n3. His philosophy: this piece is a little flimsy but I still think the idea could work. Gun states the your endurance only increases in proportion to every hit you take, now this is gonna be a bit of a reach but I think this is him  believing the only way to get stronger is with real experience (fighting); I also think there have been instances in the comic where he states as such.\n\nBonus piece: his narrative,  Guns narrative is extremely saiyan coded. From his birth, to his clan, to his outlook. Gun believes a good fight to be among the heights of pleasure. His entire existence from conception has been for the purpose of fighting its basically in his blood. Gun getting some form of zenkai boost after encountering strong opponents would not only be a great ability but also make sense with his narrative \nPlease let me know how you feel about this theory in the comments. \n                       \n\n\n"

    "selftext": "[**Porcelain Bat**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/bats-all-folks/porcelain-bat-perfume-oil/) (*warm, unsettling thrum of musky fur and leathery wings smushed against frosted orris root and vanilla plaster dust*) The warmth of living fur translated through frost, musky and intimate but held at a distance, like running your hand along a taxidermied ermine in a Victorian curiosity cabinet, soft, oddly tender, and deeply unsettling in its refrigerated stillness. There's a chalky sweetness clinging to the claws, cream gone cold and dusty, the chilled incense of snowy little footprints preserved in ice.\n\n[**Interview with the Lovebat** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/bats-all-folks/interview-with-the-lovebat-perfume-oil/)(*pink strawberries floating in sparkling blood orange and French lime fizz, enveloped in a swooshy cape of black velvet plum*) Cartoon-bright citrus fizzing with fruit-punch pandemonium, the unhinged glee of Marge Simpson and Linda Belcher getting day drunk on gin-gimlets sprinkled with pop rocks and Nerds and deciding they're starting a cult or a band or maybe both, their vision board includes glitter, all the cutest pictures of Gene Wilder, and at least seven different shades of pink highlighter.\n\n[**Hiss & Hearse**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/hiss-hearse-perfume-oil/) (*a dribble of Dorian and a squiggle of Snake Oil, delicately stirred with a moss-crusted muddy shovel*) Sugar-cubed breakfast tea staining antique lace, a doily dropped and ground into cemetery mud, delicate embroidery work sodden with petrichor and root rot. Something powdery-sweet that should be refined and parlor-proper now caked in wet earth, the smell of a Victorian burial shroud exhumed after a heavy rain, still clinging to its faded elegance even as soil crusts the hems. Graveyard loam sweetened with the ghost of afternoon service, bone china teacups filled with dirt.\n\n[**Witch Flash**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/halloween-flash-sheet/witch-flash-perfume-oil/) (*tattoo ink infused with sorcerous roots and heady incense*). The blackest black that light refuses to touch, proprietary darkness jealously guarded, Vantablack if it grew roots and got tangled in underground electrical wiring. Dank sour earth threaded with something chemical and adhesive, the smell of vinyl insulation wrapped around ancient woody resins, rubbery and sharp and deliberately strange. A color so black it's basically a monopoly, a void so deliberately crafted it feels witchy by sheer force of absorbing everything around it, turning incense smoke into something industrially arcane and territorially weird.\n\n[**Skeleton Flash**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/halloween-flash-sheet/skeleton-flash-perfume-oil/) (polished bone shards, scorched sandalwood and tattoo ink) The other end of that proprietary spectrum, what happens when you develop the negative and all that jealously-guarded darkness flips to stark white light. Bare canvas stretched over scorched wood, primer coat before the ink goes in, the erasure that comes before creation. Bleached cotton, chalk dust, correction fluid painted over mistakes, clinical and clean. The empty space, the blank page, a more fraught and unforgiving reckoning than being lost in the dark, somehow more existentially annihilating than staring down the void.\n\n[**I've Got Out At Last**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/ive-got-out-at-last-perfume-oil/) (*torn paper revealing scorched plaster embedded with bitter citron, yellow grapefruit, and damp white cedar)* Perfect citrus segments arranged on a plate you can only see through iron bars, the breezy morning light cruel in its beauty. Grapefruit pith papery and bitter, dried allium flowers, pale purple pompoms translucent and slightly vegetal and musky-sharp, the detritus of something once fresh now aged into brittleness. That texture of things left to desiccate in captivity, the ghost of brightness viewed through obstruction, just the bitter rind of it pressed against your tongue.\n\n[**Batty Lace** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/bats-all-folks/batty-lace-2025-perfume-oil/)(*a leathered up, musky interpretation of Antique Lace*) Bela Lugosi's Dead run through a sticky-syruped tape deck, caramel-amber static, cotton candy spun through patchouli interference, sweet pop frequencies cutting to Motörhead grinding through blown speakers, then Sisters of Mercy cathedral-goth reverb deep and dark. Every time you think you've locked onto one signal, the transmission cuts out, and it shifts into something completely contradictory, soft Pink Pony Club sweetness short-circuits into something bass-heavy and shadowed and back again. \\[*EDIT: Ha! I guess I reviewed this in 2023, too. Here is what I said, \"The caramel aspect of this blend is what I notice most, a buttery-milky brown sugar caramel that wants to ooze over vanilla ice cream rather than firm up into fudgy squares. Shifting beneath the caramel are those faint, faded attic-trunk florals and creamy cobwebby linens I recall from Antique Lace and a cracked leather buckle so ghostly and elusive I’m not sure if it was actually ever there at all.\"\\]*\n\n[**Dead Leaves and Skin Musk**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/pile-of-leaves-2025/dead-leaves-and-skin-musk-perfume-oil/) *(no notes listed)* Soap bubbles catching October's dying light, the way autumn evenings used to stretch infinite even as they ended early, time moving differently when someone else kept track of it for you. Steam rising from water drawn by someone's hands you'll never see again in this lifetime, that drowsy warmth after hours spent kicking through leaf piles, the exhaustion of childhood translated through clean suds and amber dusk. Bath time as the day collapses into early darkness, warm and safe and somehow unbearably tender in retrospect.\n\n[**Interminable Grotesques**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/interminable-grotesques-perfume-oil/) (*narcissus blooms lolling on broken stems, their buttery perfume swelling into a debased crescendo of honeyed heliotrope, toxic lily of the valley, almond blossom, and opium poppy*) Honeyed and narcotic, the kind of dizzying pareidolia where you keep almost seeing something recognizable before it dissolves back into confused blooms. Marzipan shaped into wedding cake flowers, perfect and poisonous, the immediate wrongness of food mimicking flora mimicking food. Almond ghost-flickering through a blanket of heavy white petals, there for a second, then gone, sweetness piled on sweetness until it becomes a hypnotic spiraling, beautiful in that specific way that makes you slightly sick.\n\n[**Dia de los Muertos** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween/halloween-2023/ween-perfume-oil/)(*dry, crackling leaves, the incense smoke of altars honoring Death and the Dead, funeral bouquets, the candies, chocolates, foods and tobacco of the ofrenda, amaranth, sweet cactus blossom and desert cereus)* A dream, a classroom, you hear your name, but it's coming from both inside the lesson and outside the door. \"The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/ Did squeak and gibber...were it not that I have bad dreams,\" intones a distant voice, fading. Death wrapped in vinyl, a smear in a shower curtain, a red, red hand pressed against the film. A trail of something slick and sticky, honeyed tobacco, a fruity resin, and sweet, grassy, dried blooms in its wake. A shape beckons through the barrier, a dread, phantom thing in wrapped plastic, calling from beyond the corner, and you're walking toward it —you can't stop walking toward it.\n\n[**Cherry Cola Hearse**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/cherry-cola-hearse-perfume-oil/) (*fizzy pop and a syrupy slick of motor oil splashed across disintegrating tan leather seat)* Waxy cherry candy stretched into ropes, dense chocolate-adjacent chew that's not quite chocolate, the slick pomade perfection of Kennickie's hair catching light in the rearview mirror (\"A hickey from Kenickie is like a Hallmark card, when you only care enough to send the very best!\") Fake-fruit plasticky Twizzler sweetness, Tootsie Roll richness, everything polished with product and oily swagger, neon light shine and candy-slick confidence.\n\n[**Hearse of Pancakes** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/hearse-of-pancakes-perfume-oil/)(*black coffee, syrup-drenched buckwheat cakes, and a crusty cruller for the road*) One of my brothers-in-law is a bit of a coffee enthusiast (also a bit of a snob, but that's not important to the story) and he drags us to every cafe and coffeeshop he can find whenever the family is all together. This smells exactly like what he orders, or some version of it: cafe mocha and a pastry, bitter-chocolate darkness meeting sugar-glazed fried dough. He's Icelandic, so he usually goes for the cream cake option, but this is my rose-tinted glasses recollection of those afternoons I've spent at small tables while he evaluates the beans, the roast, the crema, and I just smell this exact combination over and over until it becomes the scent of family obligation turned oddly tender and sweet.\n\n[**The Woman Behind it**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/the-woman-behind-it-perfume-oil/) (*silvered lavender and white iris shuddering like lamplight on stained plaster, ambergris frothing through vanilla husk, and the phantom outline of a rose-touched woman’s silhouette)* Sneaking into Deborah Turbeville's Unseen Versailles, elegant ghost stories and hazy hallucinations of antique decadence. A sliver of lavender soap worn translucent, the waxy trace of vintage lipstick on forgotten drinking glasses, pale powdery woods exhaling through dust-shrouded chambers. Those fleeting witnesses—hairpins, papers, cosmetics left in neglected storage rooms—so delicate an open window might blow them all away. The specific scent of beauty rituals frozen mid-performance, isolation and romanticism suspended in abandoned gilt, the haunting intimacy and immersion of faded grandeur where pristine splendor once might have kept you behind velvet ropes.\n\n[**Dead Leaves and a Woolly Jumper.**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/pile-of-leaves-2025/dead-leaves-and-a-wooly-jumper-perfume-oil/) *(no notes listed)* The main character from some isekai anime I'm making, totally making up just for this perfume review, but if someone writes the screenplay, they'd better give me credit! \"I Died Choking on Strawberry Milk Pocky and Got Reincarnated as the Autumn Demon Queen.\" Dead leaves crushed underfoot, meeting kawaii streetwear: the crunchy vegetation of seasonal decay paired with fuzzy pink cable-knit and cartoon-animal faces. She's supposed to preside over fall and mortality but shows up to every council meeting in a patchwork sweater with bunnies on it, strawberry milk powder dusting her sleeves, strawberry marshmallow mochi in her pockets, strawberry white choco latte in her baby pink Stanley cup, pastel in a world of russet and rot, autumn trying its best to be taken seriously while its demon queen insists on being adorable. (I'll be honest, [this sweater](https://myjapanclothes.com/cdn/shop/files/japanese-rabbit-pull_2_grande.jpg?v=1728904545) inspired this entire review.)\n\n[**Lime Green Hearse** ](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/lime-green-hearse-perfume-oil/)*(lime rind, citron, petitgrain, white musk, a swish of bay rum and a bit of black pepper)*  What if the green fairy wasn't absinthe at all but lime flavoring? That chemical brightness that tastes nothing like actual limes but everything like the Platonic ideal of citrus translated through laboratory genius. An electric emerald conjuring that appears in jelly beans, gummy bears, snow cones, Jello molds, Freezee pops, a green that only exists in artificial form, nature could never! La fée verte viridian visions granted not through wormwood but through whatever makes lime lifesavers taste like that, like chartreuse and shamrock make you feel, impossibly, deliriously green.\n\n[**Hot Pink Hearse**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/wild-hearses/hot-pink-hearse-perfume-oil/) *(flashy pink guava, strawberry jam, sugared pink grapefruit, blackberry, bergamot, and pink champagne adorned with a gleaming chrome Landau bar)* OMG. This is the absolute, exquisite embodiment of the best Kool-Aid recipe ever, courtesy that one scene in *Slumber Party Massacre*: one package of Kool-Aid (ultra-pink, berried chaos, fruit-punch-adjacent) and seven heaping cups of sugar dissolved into a scant tablespoon of water. I swear you can even smell the fizzy granules wafting up to tickle your nostrils. Complete and utter perfection.\n\n[**Committing Every Artistic Sin**](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2025/the-yellow-wallpaper/committing-every-artistic-sin-perfume-oil/) *(turmeric-dusted acrid marigold, linseed oil, bitter orange peel, crumbling plaster, clotted vanilla, and a whiff of sweet mildew)* The smell of creative obsession after you've been working for days without noticing, that moment you finally surface and realize you're hungry and aching and haven't showered in who knows how long. Something sour and unwashed, cheesy and human, the physical cost of disappearing into your work. From across the room it's intriguing, that particular musk of someone deep in the zone, but up close it's almost repellent—the reality of bodies neglected in service of making something. Where do we go when we're like that? What liminal space swallows us whole, spits us out days later blinking and disoriented? You leave your body there, or it leaves you, time moves differently or doesn't move at all. You emerge with paint under your fingernails, ink stains blooming across your palms, the ghost of ideas still clinging to your hair. The work gets done but you can't remember eating, sleeping, the basic maintenance of being alive. You've been somewhere else entirely, some fevered creative underworld where the only thing that matters is finishing, completing, manifesting whatever's been clawing at your insides demanding to exist. This is what that place smells like—not the glossy fantasy of the tortured artist, but the actual funk of artistic sin. Stale breath and forgotten meals, skin gone sour from stress hormones and tunnel vision, clothes worn too many days in a row because changing them would mean acknowledging the outside world still exists. The sourness of someone who's been burning themselves as fuel, converting flesh and sleep and sanity into something tangible, something real. You bring back the work, yes, but also this smell, this evidence of the sacrifice, proof you went somewhere most people won't follow because it costs too much to stay there. The dry down smells like the finished work itself, an earthy elegance polished by multiple drafts and a diligent editor, refined into something presentable... but underneath runs an insistent current, the indelible signature of the creator's weird funk."

    "selftext": "Hello—my partner and I are considering suing a home improvement company that we used for a shower renovation back in 2024. Really, we are just looking for some information on if we might have a legal leg to stand on or if this venture would be a complete waste of time and even more money. We are located in Idaho (United States). Below are the details of our issue:\n\nOur shower renovation was completed in September 2024. By November 2024, we discovered water leaking into our partition wall caused by contractor negligence. The partition wall separates the shower and the toilet area, and we noticed this leak as the wall began to bubble. Someone came out within a couple of days and repaired the leak itself, but the damage to the wall remained. This initiated an eight-month period of minimal communication and unresolved damage despite repeated outreach efforts on my part to the company. It got to the point where I had to call them every 3-5 days to follow up, otherwise, we wouldn't hear back for weeks. After eight months, I was finally able to get someone from the company to come out and fix what THEY damaged in the first place. When they fixed the wall, they confirmed that there were a few minimal specks of mold. We took pictures, and they sprayed it with some kind of a mold killer. While the damage was repaired, it took them eight months to follow through on their warranty, and the communication was beyond terrible. We have photos of text messages to our project manager that went unanswered for weeks. For nearly the past year, we have been seeking partial reimbursement for the delays, damage, and lack of responsiveness. We have asked four times about partial reimbursement and have been told each time that this was possible (we have one confirmation in writing), and that we would discuss this after the damage was fixed. \n\n  \nSo the damage is eventually fixed, and I reach out to ask about partial reimbursement and 1. I wasn't able to get ahold of anyone who could discuss this with me for nearly two months, and 2. When I did get ahold of someone, I was told that the company had now changed their policy and couldn't offer ANY reimbursement at all, and that all they could give me was an apology, despite our contract predating this change—I am unsure if our contract has a clause that allows them to do this. \n\n  \nI've complained about this company everywhere possible—google, facebook, better business bureau, and directly to the company members themselves. They aren't budging on this and said that they could give us a discount on any future work, but can't reimburse us anything. \n\nThe primary goal of this renovation was to eliminate the previous homeowner's DIY tile work, and most importantly, to address and prevent potential mold issues. We are deeply disappointed that despite investing nearly $20,000 in this project, we were left with unresolved water damage, a potential mold issue, and ongoing dissatisfaction with the management of the project.\n\nWe are not asking for all of our $20,000 to be reimbursed, we just want some financial accountability as this whole situation has taken a great deal of time, effort, and missed work on my part (to be home for them to fix all the stuff and to go back and forth on the phone with them). I don't know, is suing them worth it? Or is this something that I should just drop?"

The only good episodes the channel has anymore are when the Smosh team comes up, or other people other than the usual guests.\n\nI'm slowly getting out of the THT bubble, next is finishing all the Patreon stories I've missed and then cancelling that subscription!"

It has been several hours since he had eaten. Worse, he had found the snacks and the 'emergency rations' in his office were all gone.\n\nPossibly eaten by the maintenance and cleaning staffs.\n\nSthsschk had called the cafeteria several times but all he had managed to reach was the answering machine. He wanted to go to the vending machines not far away, grab something to eat.\n\nBut he had the report almost finished. Once it was finished he could go get something to eat. Maybe even at one of the diners around.\n\nNot that he was in any hurry to finish the report.\n\nThe subject was a grim one. The Admiralty had just admitted to what had to have been one of the largest blunders in tens of thousands of years.\n\nOrnislarp Noocracy Naval Intelligence had incorrectly identified the Solarian Iron Dominion as TerraSol. They had mistakenly estimated that the single planet had the war fighting strength of every other single planet system the Noocracy had ever encountered.\n\nOnly, the Solarian Iron Dominion apparently had millions of spaceships, hundreds of billions of troops, and entire planets devoted to nothing more than building war fighting technology.\n\nThe Noocracy had such things. Factory planets. But not that turned out entire supermassive ships in what was estimated to be 16-25 months from empty construction slip to shakedown cruise. The Noocracy trained warrior caste, had ramped up the amount of warrior caste to three million a year.\n\nThe Solarians had apparently twenty-five million in training at any given time.\n\nThe Noocracy had tanks and strikers and armored personnel carriers.\n\nThe Solarians had ten times what the Noocracy did. A hundred times.\n\nAnother terrible failure by Noocracy Intelligence.\n\nThe Terrans had specialized warrior classes.\n\nThe big hulking ones with all the spikes had been determined to be the warrior caste. Spies and espionage before the bagging had reported there was millions of them after the Mar-gite War, but they had vanished.\n\nThe Noocracy had believed, at the time, that the Terrans had performed the basic logical action of disposing of the warrior caste that was not needed, rather than expend resources to support them.\n\nBut that wasn't the truth.\n\nThe truth was, that spies had managed to inform Noocracy Intelligence of just before they had been ejected from the Solarian System, there was no Terran warrior caste.\n\nEvery Terran was a possible warrior caste. The Terrans sent their best. Ones who had to pass difficult mental and physical tests to be a warrior.\n\nAnd the huge hulking creatures?\n\nThey'd been kept in cryostasis.\n\nThe rumors had been true. Terrans and cryostasis mixed.\n\nEverything just kept getting worse and worse.\n\nSthsschk had to coallate the worst intelligence failure in tens of thousands of years.\n\nHe groaned as his interior tentacles twisted around each other, pulling at each other.\n\nReaching out, he grabbed his communicator and punched in the number for the cafeteria. The lights flickered as he heard the line ring.\n\nHis eyes opened wider when they answered.\n\n\"Food and Drink. Please state your identity.\"\n\n\"Government Service Worker Grade Twenty-Three Sthsschk.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"You are not authorized on this line.\"\n\nThe line went dead.\n\nFor a second he could swear the voice on the other end laughed at him.\n\nHe stared at the callset for a moment, then ground his grinding plates in the equivalent of a shrug and turned back to his work.\n\nNow he had written the report and just needed to put the final cross reference numbers. But Sthsschk had grown hungry to the point that his great stomach was churning. He was grinding the teeth together. The interlocked 'fingers' on the outside lips kept tensing.\n\nHe was hungry and out of snacks.\n\nSthsschk was just about to just save the document and go to the vending machine when the door to his office cracked open.\n\n\"Mommy?\" the voice was high pitched, weak.\n\nThe voice of a young Hamaroosan female pouchling, who was staring at Sthsschk with wide eyes.\n\n\"Is my mommy in here?\" it squeaked.\n\nSthsschk stood up and moved around the desk slowly.\n\n\"She said for you to wait here,\" he said. He couldn't help it, his mandibles unlimbered from inside his mouth and the grinding plates rubbed together in a rasp designed to frighten prey.\n\nThe little pouchling squealed in fear, turned, and ran.\n\nSthsschk ran out of the office, unaware that the lights in his office had flickered for a moment.\n\n\"MOMMY! MOMMY! HELP! HELP!\" the pouchling was squealing.\n\n\"Shmee? Shmee? Oh, Digital Omnimessaih, Shmee, where are you?\" echoed through the hallway.\n\nThe little pouchling was running, making noises of distress. It scrambled down the hallway, slipping and sliding as its little feet had trouble getting traction on the waxed floor as it ran for the corner.\n\nSkittering after, Sthsschk felt his great stomach opening up, the fingers unlacing to allow the lips to pull back and expose the interlocked teeth.\n\n\"MOMMY!\" the pouchling screamed.\n\n\"SHMEE!\" came the shout back.\n\nSthsschk put on a burst of speed, grabbing the little pouchling and pulling it into his mouth with his mandibles.\n\nThe pouchling screamed in fear, the sound cut off as Sthsschk rubbed the grinding plates together, crushing and bruising it without killing it. Softening it up, disorienting and slightly injuring it. The taste was fuzzy and slightly off, but he didn't care, the clothing could account for that.\n\n\"SMEE, NO!\" came the shout from somewhere, but he didn't care as the turned around and skittered back the way he had came.\n\nIt made muffled noises of distress as it dropped into the first stomach. As he moved back to his office, feeling pleasure as the scream of horror from behind him, he closed his great mouth, interlacing the fingers together to hold the lips together. As he closed the door Sthsschk hurpled his minor stomach a few times and dumped the heavy little pouchling into his great stomach.\n\nHe was unaware of a low malevolent chuckle from the dark shadows of the hallway.\n\nHe burped as the little pouchling seemed to roll into his stomach. True, it was a large, waddling, fat little marsupial with four arms and a big head, but he didn't remember them being that heavy. The passageway between the two stomach felt a little distended around the pouchling and hurt slightly.\n\nBut he had something in his stomach.\n\nThe lights flickered for a moment as he moved to the chair and sat back down.\n\nHe could hear the noises of distress in the hallway and he closed his eyes to savor them.\n\nThe pouchling was wiggling and he tried to still it with the tentacles, but his stomach must have been too acidic so now the tentacles were coated with too much protective mucus and it couldn't grab the little pouchling.\n\nFeeling better either way, he opened the file and started working.\n\nHis stomach twisted, but he ignored it. The furry little thing was a little harder to digest than he thought it was. It had also gone quiet.\n\n**YOU WILL DIE HERE**\n\nSthsschk blinked at the text in the middle of his report on the possible military industrial complex strength of just You're-A-Goon, since apparently they had something called The Blue Fairy Protocol at work.\n\nHe stared at it and it suddenly seemed to turn to liquid. It ran down the screen of his computer only to steam and dissolve.\n\nHis stomach cramped.\n\nSthsschk shook himself and then decided he'd get something to drink. He got up, moved to the door, and went out, turning and locking it behind him. He turned back around and jerked back, keening in fear.\n\nA Hamaroosan was in front of him, its fur and flesh melted away here and there to reveal bone. One eye socket was full of red fire the other had a white eye in it. It was screaming, raising a thick brush blade over its head with all four hands.\n\nHe jerked back, covering his braincase with his arms, closing his eyes and keening in fear.\n\nNothing happened. The scream had stopped.\n\nAfter a moment he opened his eyes.\n\nThe hallway was empty.\n\n*Working too hard. Too long*, Sthsschk thought to itself as it skittered down the hallway to the vending machine. He waved his bracelet in front of the machine and got a drink, water and nutrients, sipping at it through the straw as he headed back to his office.\n\nHe stopped when he saw his door.\n\nSomeone had hacked **I AM GOING TO KILL YOU** into the plastic coating of the door.\n\nHe drew back, looking around quickly. While his eyes looked around him at all times, he had to concentrate to see out of them, and like most of his species, he only saw in a 60 degree cone. Anything more required a lot more concentration.\n\nIt was mostly the warrior caste that could see in 180 degrees.\n\nBy the time his vision rotated back to the door it was blank again.\n\nHe blinked.\n\nNo carving. Nothing.\n\nHe opened the door and scurried through, letting it close behind him.\n\nHis left middle leg spasmed, flying out and smacking against the side of his desk. He cried out in pain and shifted to try to look at it.\n\nIt was broken off, laying on the floor, violet blood leaking from it.\n\nHe blinked, staring.\n\nIn between one blink and the next it vanished.\n\nHe shuddered.\n\nWorking too long? Maybe someone he ate? That pouchling had seemed a little heavy. Maybe it had eaten something that wasn't agreeing with him. He concentrated, writhing the feeding tentacles in his stomach to find the remains of the pouchling so he could eject it.\n\nNothing.\n\nHe tried opening his greater mouth to let any slurry from the pouchling run out.\n\nHis mouth wouldn't open. Trying to release the fingers, to let go of the interlacing, made them hurt, made them feel like they were tearing at his flesh. Trying to open his lips made it feel like his lip skin was going to tear, like his teeth were going to tear out at the roots.\n\nThe nerves around his stomach vibrated and he tried not to vomit as nausea filled him.\n\nHe sipped at the pouch, then moved to the computer.\n\nThe report was almost done.\n\nHe settled in, tapped the pointing device, then tapped in his six digit passcode.\n\nThe computer lit up and he stared in horror.\n\nHe'd sent the message to his superior!\n\nHe quickly opened up his mail program.\n\nThere it was. The message with \"Attend to immediately\" pinned to it.\n\nThe message was: \"Eat or be eaten\".\n\nThat made him nod. That was a good way to sum up the Solarian Iron Dominion.\n\nFeeling a sinking feeling he checked the attachment.\n\nOnly, it wasn't the report.\n\nIt was images of his supervisor with multiple large animal genitalia in his mouth. The caption read \"OH NO! I AM CHOKING ON A MILLION DICKS!\" with his supervisor's name on the image, unnecessarily.\n\nThe next was of Sthsschk himself with an angry expression, pausing mid-mating with an obese and ugly female in front of a sign on the wall that was a circle with the Solarian letter for \"K\" in the middle. The caption was: \"Really? In front of your mom?\"\n\nSthsschk made noises of distress. His supervisor was going to murder him!\n\nAnother image appeared. It was of his superior, only coded as female, wearing the wrap and leggings of a common prostitute, with the words \"GOT ANYMORE OF THEM REPORTS?\" on the bottom, holding an artificial penis as if it was a Treana'ad smokestick.\n\nKeening in horror, he reached forward to shut off the computer.\n\nThe images vanished and his hand froze.\n\nThe dark screen had words slowly appear.\n\n**I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WOULD DIE HERE**\n\nThe pain started.\n\nAnd he found he could scream.\n\n0-0-0-0-0\n\nNgychhhk rushed down the corridor, all six of his legs moving to propel him rapidly down the hallway to the blank plastic coated door of one of his subordinates. He was so angry that his vision had tunneled down. His great stomach was awash with acid and his lesser stomach was producing acid and then squeezing to force the acid into his greater stomach.\n\nHow DARE Sthsschk send him such images! How DARE that incompetent functionary insult his mother, his spouse, HIM in such a matter.\n\nCarved on the door were words that made him pause for a second.\n\nBut only a second.\n\nIgnoring the \"YOU WILL REGRET OPENING THIS DOOR\" that was carved into the soft plastic, he waved his bracelet in front of the door. It opened to reveal a square of jet black.\n\nHe was so angry he didn't bother thinking, he just rushed in.\n\nThe door shut behind him, booming shut like an iron gate.\n\nHe slid to a stop.\n\nIt was pitch back.\n\n\"Show yourself, coward, and be eaten!\" he screeched.\n\nA single light lit with a hiss. A red flame at the end of a thin wooden stick. The brightness made Ngychhhk jerk back, hissing. The flame touched a twisted fiber wick, passing the flame.\n\nThe single flame was lifted up to reveal a long, narrow, pallid face with jet black eyes.\n\nA *Terran* face.\n\n\"I warned you,\" the Terran stated.\n\nThe candle brightened and Ngychhhk stared at what was revealed behind the Terran.\n\nSthsschk was pinned on the wall, his legs stretched out to full extension, his insides opened, laid out like a vivisection experiment.\n\nNgychhhk saw that his underling was alive and trying to scream but he was unable to inflate his lung.\n\nThe Terran was tall, dressed in black outer clothing with a white undershirt. It had dark black hair, pale skin, and a golden medallion at its throat held there by a red ribbon.\n\n\"You think that you are the top of Eat,\" the Terran said.\n\nNgychhhk began to try to back up, bumping into the door.\n\nThe Terran exposed long sharp pointed teeth.\n\n\"But you are not. You are not even worth To Be Eaten,\" the Terran said. It blew out the little flame, dropping the stick, and moved around the desk.\n\nOnly the candle kept the darkness back.\n\n\"And I do not say blah bleh blah.\"\n\nThe candle went out.\n\nAnd the screaming resumed.\n\nHAT WEARING AUNTIE\n\nBrr.\n\nThat's twice.\n\nSomething wicked this way comes.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTREANA'AD HIVE WORLDS\n\nWhat?

Massive, twisted superstructure and strange lines. Jagged edges, sharp corners. A ship designed with carnage in mind.\n\nThe Gravewatcher stared at the holotank as the distortion cleared, his hand held up to hold off the thunder of his ship's massive guns. He had slumbered long in the depths of the not-space but his guns were live as he waited to see who dared wake him from his sleep.\n\nThe image cleared to reveal a Daughter of an Immortal. She stood on the bridge of a ship crewed entirely by her siblings. She was short, her black hair cut short, her face plain, her gray eyes dark.\n\nShe recited ancient codes, chanted ancient permissions, cast spells forbidden to mortals that had long since forgotten such things existed.\n\nThe Gravewatcher closed his fist.\n\nThe guns went offline. The sensors went dark.\n\nThe Gravewatcher vanished from the bridge in a twist of purple smoke.\n\n0-0-0-0-0\n\nThe small human female did not bother with a vac-suit, did not bother with fiction. She would not insult The Gravewatcher with such untruths. He was an Ancient, from the Time of the Immortals, from the time of her father.\n\nAnd he deserved respect from her and her sisters.\n\nShe followed The Watcher as the massive figure moved through the dark and silent halls of the Obelisk AKA Black Box 536169-6c6f72-204d6f6f6e. Dust left ropes in the corners of the hallways, lights flickered and buzzed, and their footsteps echoed.\n\nFinally they reached the unremarkable room on the center of the Obelisk. There were no chairs, no comfort offered, just a single waist high rectangular pillar with a faintly glowing square on the top.\n\nThe small woman put her hand against the datapad.\n\nData scrolled by in midair, stopping at the very end.\n\n**ACTIVATE PROJECT?**\n\nShe touched the yes icon.\n\n0-0-0-0-0\n\nThe girl's eyes fluttered open.\n\nShe was a Lolita Sorceress of the Sailor Moon Sisterhood...\n\n...and she was Born Whole.\n\nHAT WEARING AUNTIE\n\nThe seers cry out in fear\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nSOLARIAN IRON DOMINION\n\nThey attacked Terra itself.\n\nYou know what happens next.\n\n/////////\n\nHAT WEARING AUNTIE\n\nOf everyone...\n\nYes.

It was halfway through a six month lifespan. It primarily subsisted on other insects, was capable of flying, and its excretions were good for breaking down cellulose.\n\nIt was grabbed by a small marsupial and eaten. The marsupial was male and had fathered nearly thirty progeny. It was most of the way through a six year lifespan. It existed off of certain nuts, fruits, and insects.\n\nIt was ambush grabbed by a larger mammal. Flightless, six legs (although some throwbacks had eight, which evolution had decided was too many to bother with and did not provide any necessary advantages), with binocular vision and four eyes (evolution was thinking about removing one) it was a third of the way through a fifteen year life cycle. It ran off with its prize, plunging into the vegetation which its mottled coat helped it hide in.\n\nA storm was brewing, the planet still fairly young at two point five billion years, so it was often consumed by temper tantrums as it rotated around the stellar mass.\n\nThe star was 4.5 billion years old, comfortably yellow, and fairly energetic.\n\nExcept, everything was decided younger than that.\n\n*She* was just past the last planet in the orbital plane. Inside the beginning of the Oort Cloud.\n\nHer skin was dark, glossy black, the stars reflected in her skin. Her hair was long and white, streaming out behind her in a river. Her eyes were startling blue as they took in everything.\n\nShe was out there with no ship, no suit, nothing.\n\nShe looked over the system and found her handiwork good.\n\nLifting one hand she traced a sideways figure-8 that glittered.\n\nShe would see if any of her sisters were still awake. If not, she would wake them.\n\nShe would wake her choruses to help her.\n\nThe Singer in the Dark vanished without so much as a ripple.\n\nThe star giggled to itself, unaware it had been the spreading debris of a nova not long before.\n\nHAT WEARING AUNTIE\n\nSomething wicked this way comes indeed.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTREANA'AD HIVE WORLDS\n\nWith the amount of moo moo casualties, don't expect me to care what happens to them.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTELKAN FORGE WORLDS\n\nDon't we have to vote to use stuff like this?\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nSOLARIAN IRON DOMINION\n\nYou don't get a vote in shit when it comes to *MY* weapons.\n\nThey attacked TerraSol.\n\nI'm going to show them why it's a very very bad idea.\n\n/////////\n\nTELKAN FORGE WORLDS\n\nBut these are weapons of mass destruction just by their very nature.\n\nEven the Atrekna required a vote.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nSOLARIAN IRON DOMINION\n\nTell you what, fuzzy, invent your own superweapons then you can have a say about a superweapon being deployed.\n\n/////////\n\nRIGEL\n\nThey have it coming.\n\nThey ALL have it coming.\n\nALL OF THEM HAVE IT COMING!\n\nDEATH TO THE YOUNGER RACES!\n\nDEATH TO THE SILENCERS OF THE SONG!\n\nDEATH IN THE NAME OF THE TERRIBLE SILENCE OF THE DUCKS!\n\nDEATH!\n\nDEATH TO ALL WHO BEHOLD US!\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nHAT WEARING AUNTIE\n\nFor too long we have let the younger races disrespect us.\n\nNo more.\n\nWe will demonstrate our power.\n\nLet them hide in caves and fear our presence.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTREANA'AD HIVE WORLDS\n\nWhat sis said.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nLEEBAW CONTEMPLATION POOL\n\nOoooh, this is gonna be fun.\n\nJAWNCONNOR JAWNCONNOR JAWNCONNOR!\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\n\\[[First Contact](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[Dark Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16hzgya/the_dark_ages_01/)\\] \\[[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1aeebjr/nova_wars_prologue/)\\] \\[[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ofg23g/nova_wars_chapter_157/)\\] \\[Next\\] \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]"

    "selftext": "So we've been chopping around at basically the same low 100k price for nearly a year. You might even say technically USD has lost 10% so we are down 10%. I'm far from an expert, but I see the experts saying things like we could crash 60 to 90% instantly, if stock market bubble pops. I don't really see a case for that when the majority of people are supposedly holding for decades to come. It actually makes more sense to me that money would jump from the stock market to BTC if a downturn on that side happens, but all the experts say the opposite. Risk assets drop faster when the stock market goes down.  On the flip side I don't see the bullish case either.  I don't see new interest.  We had all these ETFs flow in this year, yet the price is stagnant. Where is the $$ supposed to be coming from that we can go up to 150k or higher in the next few months?  Neither side makes sense to me.   What I could see happening is just a sad gradual drop back to basically nothing over the course of a couple years.  I need somebody who isn't an absolute Saylor disciple to talk me down off the ledge LOL"

We just hit an hour and then bam it all goes to shit when we get spawn killed by the 2 Wandas stunning us as soon as we spawn. We can’t stay alive long enough for anyone to spawn back in. We were soft locked. It was over. That stupid mass of stun bubbles made it so we can’t spawn in. This is bs. I know it’s meant to be the hardest difficulty but if you literally can’t spawn in to play that’s a broken game, not a challenge. I’m so defeated and genuinely ruined the mode for me. Play test shit before releasing it like wtf "

I’ve been using PIA for daily stuff like streaming and browsing, but whenever I’m signing up for something sketchy or testing a new service, I switch things up.  \n  \nHere’s what I’ve been doing:  \n  \n\\- I connect to PIA first so my ISP only sees encrypted traffic.  \n  \n\\- Then I open Tor for anything that might log IPs or track sessions.  \n  \n\\- I use temp emails and disposable numbers for signups so nothing ties back to me.  \n  \nI didn’t expect it to make a big difference, but the amount of spam that’s disappeared is crazy. My main inbox and real phone barely get anything now. It also feels nice knowing that if one of those random accounts leaks, it doesn’t link back to my real info.  \n  \nIt’s not about being paranoid, more like trying to keep my digital life compartmentalized. Each layer handles a different part of privacy: VPN hides my traffic, Tor hides my path, and temp logins keep my identity clean."

    "selftext": "To me recovering nearly $6 million in crypto from a coded wallet that had been locked behind an intricate numerical puzzle is something that really burst my bubble.\n\n  \nThe discovery came during an investigation into a suspected high-level criminal who had allegedly built his fortune by selling tech-related tools to other offenders. When police examined his phone, they found password protected notes and an image filled with scattered numbers and random words. Investigators soon realized it might point to a hidden crypto wallet. Before i dug into the incident I actually had to ask Satoshi on GetAgent if the asset there was bitcoin and his thoughts on the method they used, but still i just moved to reading it myself and left the question there to get access to the 1 month ultra and some btc related extras.\n\n  \nI later found out that the suspect refused to share the access keys, which under Australian law can carry a decade long sentence. That pushed the Australian Federal Police’s digital forensics unit to dig deeper. One of their data scientists eventually cracked the code by noticing a subtle pattern where each sequence had an extra number added to the front. Removing those misplaced digits revealed the 24-word seed phrase, unlocking the wallet and exposing $5.9 million worth of digital assets.\n\n  \nAFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett called it “miraculous work,” praising the analyst, now known within the agency as a “crypto safe cracker.” It wasn’t his first success either, as the same expert had previously helped recover another $3 million using a different decoding method.\n\n  \nThe seized crypto has been transferred to the AFP’s Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce. If the courts approve, the funds will be redirected into a federal account used to support crime prevention initiatives across Australia."

Seeing there isn't enough strength yet, I streched and folded the dough a bit. Half an hour later I rounded it up to a smooth ball and covered it to ferment inside a pot. Let it ferment for ~6 hours in a pretty hot room (I'd say at least 26 C), doing coil folds when I saw it had flattend out (once every 1-2 hours). When the dough seemd bubbly an jiggly I shaped it into a batard and proofed it for 40 minutes. It was baked open on a glass dish, with a bowl of boiling water beneth and an upside down tray above to trap the steam. After 30 minutes I removed the bowl and the tray, to find out that a crust was already formed (although I got a pretty good oven spring). I continued to bake until I saw the ear beginjng to burn.\n\nIt seems that the texture is a bit gummy, and a crust was barely formed on the bottom, which was mostly soft out of the oven. The taste is tangi and delicious.\n\nHow do you think I can improve my next loaf?\n"

It still really hurts to talk about him but I have got to a point where just thinking about him doesn't make me burst into tears any more. \n\n  \nHe was called Bubbles, after Bubbles from the trailer park boys. He was the cutest, and had a couple of health issues (mainly chronic constipation requiring enemas), and the fact he was REALLY small (our current kitty who is 12 weeks old is actually bigger than he was waaaa). He was 6 years old and 2 months. He was one of my sister's cat's kittens that we fell for and took home when he was old enough. He was a little moody, and preferred to sleep somewhere comfy and look out of the window rather than play or see people but he also enjoyed being carried around and showed things lol. He was my indoor baby, but he also had no interest in going out - when doing time in the garden he would always run back into the house as fast as he could if he saw anyone or if the gate was open. He was talkative (but shy with new people), and opinionated. He would beg for human food constantly, and drop his shyness if you have a tasty ham or cheese. \n\n  \nI miss him so much. We have a new cat now just because it was the first time in 20 years we haven't had a cat in the house (my old lady cat passed last year), but every cat is different and new baby's personality is so different that it makes me miss him more. I worry I moved on too fast - I missed having a cat around so bad, but I hope he understands. \n\n  \nSorry for the long post I just really miss my man!"

    "selftext": "When I was in college, I only desired two things: a stable job in my field and a girlfriend. After I graduated, it seems that I got neither. They always told me that not everyone starts out with their dream job, and I finally understood that when I worked at my local grocery store for shit pay. I wasn’t ready to accept it then, even after 500 emails saying I didn’t fit the “matched” jobs, but I guess life had other options for me. The best I could ever do was land this one. Four years of earning my degree only to use my university level training in scanning products, weighting products, and dealing with customers. \n\nThings back home weren’t so good either. My parents got themselves into major financial debt just so that I could complete college. My dad was doing double shifts while my mom had to do three just to break even with the mortgage payments on top of it too. With me in that terrible job, it was the best I could do to contribute to them.\n\nIt wasn’t too bad though since I made a friend at the grocery store, his name was Victor. Loves Jesus as much as he loves horror movies. More than that, though, he was a beacon of hope to live on instead of just giving up. I even remembered speaking to my friend Victor about the latest movie we’d seen. It felt good to engage with him. It felt like a cushion to cope with the pandemonium of my post-college reality. Moreso by someone that understood me. The only warmth I felt in this dreary job was sharing a shift with him.\n\nIt was the day she showed up.\n\n“So do you think that she got murdered in that shot?” he asked as he leaned over the checkout counter cross from me. From my perspective it felt like I was in a horror movie. The grocery store had a sickly yellowish white on the floors and everything else with build up of mildew seeping out of corners. The fluorescent lights buzzed and hummed as if they were a swarm of mosquitos. Yeah, I entertained the chances of this being my last shift.\n\n“No way,” I replied. “I think it’s meant to leave people thinking.”\n\n“Yeah that was what my girlfriend thought when we saw it.” He said as he scratched his chin hair. *My girlfriend*. My mind echoed those words. “So are you gonna go to that party I said about?”\n\n“Oh yeah, that party. I’d be down!” I replied as I thought the idea of a fun, brief, nostalgic return to college life was helpful. I needed that return to something that made sense. Definitely better than being here for minimum wage. I didn’t notice that he was about to head out for the day.\n\nWhen he clocked out and said his goodbye, my mind fell, again, into that familiar destitution. It was as if I was sinking deeper into an ocean of despair reaching conclusions like how I won’t be spending the rest of my life with someone *other* than my family. *My Girlfriend*. I had the notion that by sharing my life with someone I love and trust, things would be easier. I was naive to believe that, but I did back then. The congregation in my mind got into such heated feats of debate that I grew numb on the world around me. Eventually descending into despair. *How will this amount help my parents? Why can’t I just land a job that pays more? Why did Victor have to leave? Why am I so alone?* I wasn’t sure how long I was sinking like this. Minutes felt like hours here.\n\nThe remaining 30 minutes felt like I was in constant sleep paralysis. My eyes glazed and soggy as I got lost into the nihilistic nothingness that my mind could produce. All the while I heard the sounds of chattering customers whose breath smelled like what they ate, coworkers that were vexing imps, and a carousel of pop music that played over and over again. I heard the same 10 songs since the afternoon alongside the comforting smell of the store’s aroma of rotted vegetables and vinegar. David Bowie was singing for the 17th time before getting cut to another popular song reaching its own 17th.\n\nWhile this was the most torturous amount of time spent that I’ll never recall the next day, it wasn't not all that bad. At this hour, the store would be barren of all the usual customers that you’d see. So, when a customer does show up, they'd tend to be the weirdest ones, and it was the most memorable part working late hours here for better or for worse. I felt the tapping of footsteps approaching my counter with their items of choice. I was about to open my mouth when the words got caught in my throat as the world disappeared when I saw … *her*.\n\nI was not really that big into goth girls. I've only ever seen them online, so when I saw her, it really caught me off guard. She was a tall gothic princess; dominated in high heeled boots with silver strappings, making her about 6 ft tall. It led up to her long bluish-black dress that was only separated by both her snow white thighs and purple belt shaping her figure. Following up, her neck wore both a black choker and a silvery necklace that had a silver ankh attached to it. She also had some of those ankhs on her ear piercings, and it was only when I noticed her lip piercing did I get a good look at her face.\n\nHer face was heart shaped with ivory soft skin, rosy cheeks, and maroon red lips which gave her look doll-like and innocent. She had her jet black hair tidied up to two high pigtails broken by strands of lavender to match her smell. Finally, I looked deep into her pale blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean. An endless sea crashing against the sand on a cloudy gray mourn. So hypnotic to just forget about all the dumb problems that anyone had to deal with in the cruel things life had to offer. A feeling so true to anyone in a grocery store uniform and apron.\n\nI snapped back into reality as I was rushing to scan all of her items as she was just looking at me curiously. She didn’t say anything at all, just looked at me. It was kinda freaky, and it made me more nervous than I should. I never got that kind of attention at all. Especially from someone this beautiful.\n\n“S-Shit, s-sorry ma’am. U-uuh, how was your night? Did anything interesting happen?” I asked as I was shoving an eggplant into a bag. Usually, I’d wait for other items that match its type for neatness. She didn’t respond. She had a solemn expression which made her lips look pouty and plump. Her eyes, however, showed the most activity. She kept looking at the groceries and mostly at me. Those pale blue eyes moved precisely like crashing waves; was she analyzing me? What was she trying to find in me?\n\nIt was hard not to look, but I had to focus on my job even as I felt the heat on my face and her stare when typing up the total. The store was spinning all around me, and I kept miscalculating the total and the cash she was giving me. I cursed when I dropped a dollar as I went to pick it up, I hastily opened the till and gave her her change as I met her pale beauty again.\n\nI wanted to say something. Anything to make her say something. But I didn’t. I felt frozen there with the change in my hand as she took it, nodded and left. My eyes followed her until she was gone. I was allowed to breathe again as my heart was racing miles and my mind was running marathons with thoughts. *Who was she? I didn’t get time to get to know her. Is she single? Obviously she was not, since she looks gorgeous! BRO JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, she just wanted groceries.* I was able to clock out after 30 minutes, but she was long gone by then. I thought that I wouldn’t see her again. The notion left me wilted and went back to my car morosely. At the very least, I got something to talk about at that house party, I guess.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nVictor and I parked over to the house in some suburban place, and man, was this guy throwing a party. It was like a frat party. There was toilet paper thrown over the house and tree branches as if they were party ribbons and disco colors flashing on hues in cue with the pulsing, booming music that made anyone on a 20 mile radius want to call the police. People on the porch were either leaving because they were done or just puking up their drinks, and entering would walk slowly to record those puking. Me and Victor didn’t do it out of pity.\n\nAs if the outdoors wasn’t ravenous enough, it was truly a jungle when we entered inside. People were bouncing to the beat of the music blaring somewhere in this two story house. Guys laughing in friend groups and some trying to hit on some girls there. Some were even doing a drinking game with beer pong. Toilet paper around the ceiling fans and stair railings as it was outside, and a banquet of various chips and drinks. I helped myself with a drink and filled it with some soda - never get punch in parties - and it reminded me a bit about college life seeping in. My sinking mind was sidelined when Victor was shouting at me about something.\n\n“What?” I shouted over the music.\n\n“I said ‘so she just looked at you?” he replied.\n\n“Jeez man, I didn’t know what to say at the moment,” I said as I sipped the last of my drink.\n\n“I mean it’s okay man, people usually mess up at first,” he said as he took a swig. “But if you ever see her, just ask her out for some coffee! I mean who knows, \\*hic\\* maybe she’ll be here? This house seems big enough to fit the city in, so I guess she’d be here?”\n\n“I don’t know man,” I said pensively, staring deep into the empty cup. I have seen other people say that that’s a good way to start. Maybe I’ll give it a try if I ever get that chance.\n\n“Nah,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure she’ll show. Maybe someday, you’ll get to talk to her! Just ask her about a coffee date thing. Ya know? Anyway, \\*hic\\* I’m gonna find Lucy, she said she got in the house.” I ended up alone again as I looked around the room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t get her off my mind since that day.\n\n*Maybe Victor was right. Maybe that goth girl would show up here*. I thought. Scoffing at the idea, I went to get more to drink my problems away. While I was pouring it in, I heard a husky  voice behind me say, “Hey, I’ve seen you before.” I turned around and my heart stopped. Paralyzed and clutching at the table, I looked and was petrified.\n\n*Holy shit*. \n\nShe no longer looked like a princess but she definitely dressed more for party fashion. Same boots but now with the addition of fishnet leggings to match her dark micro short jeans, a crop top, some band called TOOL. on it, and those same piercings on her ear and lip. She had her hair fixed in an updo which made her look a bit regal with loose lavender strands\\*.\\* She looked at me with those eyes that lit up in all colors from the party lights and the warm glow of the lights gave a magical touch in the air as I got my second chance. Her eyes widened to match mine, maybe a bit too playfully as her black lips formed a smile.\n\nMy mind was having a heated debate again, much to my exhaustion. *Yo, you gotta talk to her this time! No, leave her be, might be taken already! But why would she show up to him, again?!* The internal congregation in my mind ceased when I decided that this was my only chance to talk to her. I drank my fears, swallowed, and began to speak. It felt like a century just to say hi. She smiled. It became harder to say anything at that point. The party music was drowning, the walls closing in and my mind struggling to grope for something, anything to say.\n\n“Y-y-yeah, the cashier guy.” I drawled long with a nervous gaping smile. *God, I’m so lame.* She snorted and smiled that deadly smile as she hid her mouth to take a sip of her drink; she filled in the awkward silence that followed.\n\n“So, like, how long have you been working there?” She asked.\n\n“Uhh, about a year now.\" I said without realizing the pain. A year of this bullshit.\n\n“Do you … like it there?” She seemed like she didn’t want to insinuate anything, but my face must have given her the answer. “Well, uhh, have you considered doing something else? A side hustle?\" She said as she smiled again. Teeth and all; Her canines were as perfect as she was.\n\n“What are you getting at? I don’t even… ahh crap,” I said before realizing. I gave out my hand to her. “I’m Damian. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.” I said as she took it. I didn’t expect her hand to be so cold. Maybe it was the AC in the party house.\n\n“Madeline. But you can call me Maddy,” she said as she locked eyes on mine and said, “Damian.” The way she said it gave me a deeply bubbly feeling from my nave to my chest. I felt a bit better. I knew that she was trying to seduce me, but I guess not enough to pull me over.\n\n“So, *Maddy*, what concert have you been to?” I said as suave as I can be. I guess talking about this TOOL band would be the best way to avoid the subject of my crashing career. She got deep into thought, as if to dig deep into her memory.\n\n“Uhh, I have been to, I think, the one in Detroit, Michigan. I don’t remember the type of concert but it was when they weren’t as big as they are now. I haven’t been into concerts as much though.” She said.\n\n“Have you been to Detroit? You moved in?” I said.\n\n“Yeah, I thought I could start a new life here. Too hot over there, you know?.” She said as she fixed a part of her shirt. \n\n“I’m pretty sure Detroit was just as cold as here” I said.\n\nShe looked back at me. “Yeah it was to me at least. So how about you? Have you been to a concert?”\n\n“Oh umm,” I thought hard. I rubbed the back of my neck while thinking about something to say. I didn’t know much about this band at all, but I didn’t want to sound like a wimp either. As I was thinking of something to say, I spotted both Victor and Lucy as they were watching me, Lucy giggling while Victory nodding his head with a grin of approval before waving at me. I turned to Madeline. “Uh Hey, I spotted my friends spying on us, you want to meet them?”\n\nShe snorted. “Sure, weirdo.”\n\nI went over to where Victor and Lucy were. I introduced them to Madeline and likewise as we discussed further about metal bands. I shouldn’t be surprised that she was into horror movies to which Victor interrogated her about what her favorite scary movie was. She got us to talk about that movie again. Her take was interesting. She mentioned how the girl's wounds left untreated would cause her to die by exsanguination. I looked puzzled a bit.\n\n“Since when did you take medical school?” Victor asked.\n\n“I just think it's good to know the human body and how to treat it. You know?” Madeline replied. “My family and I work with blood donations and since my parents needed someone that can take up the day shift, I was the perfect choice. Say that reminds me,” She turned over to me. “We’re looking for someone to fill in a vacancy, and I was wondering if you’d like to sign up?”\n\nI looked at her with shock. A job? Right, that side hustle she mentioned earlier. The more she described the role and benefits, the more I wanted to apply. It was definitely better than being just a grocery clerk. I thought of the potential amount of cash flowing in to help my aging parents. How proud they’d be of me that their son got a role that pays better.\n\n“So where can I sign?” Victor added jokingly before I got to ask.\n\n“Oh sorry, it’s only for one,” She said as she looked at me and gave me a business card. “I’d like to meet you at the bus’ location. I think you’d be a great fit for the role.”\n\nI took the card she gave me as we continued talking. My head was in the sky amidst the noise as I held onto her card. This girl and her job offer lifted the gloom of my hometown as I realized that I can have my cake and eat it too. It came to an end as Victor shook me back to earth.\n\n“Hey man come on now. We got work tomorrow, and I got to do something with my dad.” Shit, I forgot about that throughout all of this. So we were on our way out of the party, not nauseous at all, and as we did, Madeline said something that I always wanted to hear, and something that sealed my fate forever.\n\n“Hey so like, do you want my number?”\n\nThat was how I met my girlfriend. I wish I never had."

    "selftext": "When I was in college, I only desired two things: a stable job in my field and a girlfriend. After I graduated, it seems that I got neither. They always told me that not everyone starts out with their dream job, and I finally understood that when I worked at my local grocery store for shit pay. I wasn’t ready to accept it then, even after 500 emails saying I didn’t fit the “matched” jobs, but I guess life had other plans for me. The best I could ever do was land this one. Four years of earning my degree only to use my university level training in scanning products, weighting products, and dealing with customers.\n\n\nThings back home weren’t so good either. My parents got themselves into major financial debt just so that I could complete college. My dad was doing double shifts while my mom had to do three just to break even with the mortgage payments on top of it too. With me in that terrible job, it was the best I could do to contribute to them.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t too bad though since I made a friend at the grocery store, his name was Victor. Loves Jesus as much as he loves horror movies. More than that, though, he was a beacon of hope to live on instead of just giving up. I even remembered speaking to my friend Victor about the latest movie we’d seen. It felt good to engage with him. It felt like a cushion to cope with the pandemonium of my post-college reality. Moreso by someone that understood me. The only warmth I felt in this dreary job was sharing a shift with him.\n\n\n\nIt was the day she showed up.\n  \n\n\n“So do you think that she got murdered in that shot?” he asked as he leaned over the checkout counter cross from me. From my perspective it felt like I was in a horror movie. The grocery store had a sickly yellowish white on the floors and everything else with build up of mildew seeping out of corners. The fluorescent lights buzzed and hummed as if they were a swarm of mosquitos. Yeah, I entertained the chances of this being my last shift.\n\n\n\n“No way,” I replied. “I think it’s meant to leave people thinking.”\n\n\n\n“Yeah that was what my girlfriend thought when we saw it.” He said as he scratched his chin hair. *My girlfriend*. My mind echoed those words. “So are you gonna go to that party I said about?”  \n  \n“Oh yeah, that party. I’d be down!” I replied as I thought the idea of a fun, brief, nostalgic return to college life was helpful. I needed that return to something that made sense. Definitely better than being here for minimum wage. I didn’t notice that he was about to head out for the day.\n\n\n\nWhen he clocked out and said his goodbye, my mind fell, again, into that familiar destitution. It was as if I was sinking deeper into an ocean of despair reaching conclusions like how I won’t be spending the rest of my life with someone *other* than my family. *My Girlfriend*. I had the notion that by sharing my life with someone I love and trust, things would be easier. I was naive to believe that, but I did back then. The congregation in my mind got into such heated feats of debate that I grew numb on the world around me. Eventually descending into despair. *How will this amount help my parents? Why can’t I just land a job that pays more? Why did Victor have to leave? Why am I so alone?* I wasn’t sure how long I was sinking like this. Minutes felt like hours here.\n\n\n\nThe remaining 30 minutes felt like I was in constant sleep paralysis. My eyes glazed and soggy as I got lost into the nihilistic nothingness that my mind could produce. All the while I heard the sounds of chattering customers whose breath smelled like what they ate, coworkers that were vexing imps, and a carousel of pop music that played over and over again. I heard the same 10 songs since the afternoon alongside the comforting smell of the store’s aroma of rotted vegetables and vinegar. David Bowie was singing for the 17th time before getting cut to another popular song reaching its own 17th.\n\n\n\nWhile this was the most torturous amount of time spent that I’ll never recall the next day, it wasn't not all that bad. At this hour, the store would be barren of all the usual customers that you’d see. So, when a customer does show up, they'd tend to be the weirdest ones, and it was the most memorable part working late hours here for better or for worse. I felt the tapping of footsteps approaching my counter with their items of choice. I was about to open my mouth when the words got caught in my throat as the world disappeared when I saw … *her*.\n\n\n\nI was not really that big into goth girls. I've only ever seen them online, so when I saw her, it really caught me off guard. She was a tall gothic princess; dominated in high heeled boots with silver strappings, making her about 6 ft tall. It led up to her long bluish-black dress that was only separated by both her snow white thighs and purple belt shaping her figure. Following up, her neck wore both a black choker and a silvery necklace that had a silver ankh attached to it. She also had some of those ankhs on her ear piercings, and it was only when I noticed her lip piercing did I get a good look at her face.\n\n  \n  \nHer face was heart shaped with ivory soft skin, rosy cheeks, and maroon red lips which gave her look doll-like and innocent. She had her jet black hair tidied up to two high pigtails broken by strands of lavender to match her smell. Finally, I looked deep into her pale blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean. An endless sea crashing against the sand on a cloudy gray mourn. So hypnotic to just forget about all the dumb problems that anyone had to deal with in the cruel things life had to offer. A feeling so true to anyone in a grocery store uniform and apron.\n\n\n\nI snapped back into reality as I was rushing to scan all of her items as she was just looking at me curiously. She didn’t say anything at all, just looked at me. It was kinda freaky, and it made me more nervous than I should. I never got that kind of attention at all. Especially from someone this beautiful.\n\n\n\n“S-Shit, s-sorry ma’am. U-uuh, how was your night? Did anything interesting happen?” I asked as I was shoving an eggplant into a bag. Usually, I’d wait for other items that match its type for neatness. She didn’t respond. She had a solemn expression which made her lips look pouty and plump. Her eyes, however, showed the most activity. She kept looking at the groceries and mostly at me. Those pale blue eyes moved precisely like crashing waves; was she analyzing me? What was she trying to find in me?\n\n\n\nIt was hard not to look, but I had to focus on my job even as I felt the heat on my face and her stare when typing up the total. The store was spinning all around me, and I kept miscalculating the total and the cash she was giving me. I cursed when I dropped a dollar as I went to pick it up, I hastily opened the till and gave her her change as I met her pale beauty again.\n\n\n\nI wanted to say something. Anything to make her say something. But I didn’t. I felt frozen there with the change in my hand as she took it, nodded and left. My eyes followed her until she was gone. I was allowed to breathe again as my heart was racing miles and my mind was running marathons with thoughts. *Who was she? I didn’t get time to get to know her. Is she single? Obviously she was not, since she looks gorgeous! BRO JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, she just wanted groceries.* I was able to clock out after 30 minutes, but she was long gone by then. I thought that I wouldn’t see her again. The notion left me wilted and went back to my car morosely. At the very least, I got something to talk about at that house party, I guess.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nVictor and I parked over to the house in some suburban place, and man, was this guy throwing a party. It was like a frat party. There was toilet paper thrown over the house and tree branches as if they were party ribbons and disco colors flashing on hues in cue with the pulsing, booming music that made anyone on a 20 mile radius want to call the police. People on the porch were either leaving because they were done or just puking up their drinks, and entering would walk slowly to record those puking. Me and Victor didn’t do it out of pity.\n\n\n\nAs if the outdoors wasn’t ravenous enough, it was truly a jungle when we entered inside. People were bouncing to the beat of the music blaring somewhere in this two story house. Guys laughing in friend groups and some trying to hit on some girls there. Some were even doing a drinking game with beer pong. Toilet paper around the ceiling fans and stair railings as it was outside, and a banquet of various chips and drinks. I helped myself with a drink and filled it with some soda - never get punch in parties - and it reminded me a bit about college life seeping in. My sinking mind was sidelined when Victor was shouting at me about something.\n\n\n\n“What?” I shouted over the music.\n\n\n\n“I said ‘so she just looked at you?” he replied.\n\n\n\n“Jeez man, I didn’t know what to say at the moment,” I said as I sipped the last of my drink.\n\n\n\n“I mean it’s okay man, people usually mess up at first,” he said as he took a swig. “But if you ever see her, just ask her out for some coffee! I mean who knows, \\*hic\\* maybe she’ll be here? This house seems big enough to fit the city in, so I guess she’d be here?”\n\n\n\n“I don’t know man,” I said pensively, staring deep into the empty cup. I have seen other people say that that’s a good way to start. Maybe I’ll give it a try if I ever get that chance.\n\n\n\n“Nah,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure she’ll show. Maybe someday, you’ll get to talk to her! Just ask her about a coffee date thing. Ya know? Anyway, \\*hic\\* I’m gonna find Lucy, she said she got in the house.” I ended up alone again as I looked around the room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t get her off my mind since that day.\n\n\n\n*Maybe Victor was right. Maybe that goth girl would show up here*. I thought. Scoffing at the idea, I went to get more to drink my problems away. While I was pouring it in, I heard a husky  voice behind me say, “Hey, I’ve seen you before.” I turned around and my heart stopped.

    "selftext": "Photos 1 - 3: Original Ring, Photos 3 - 6: Rebuilt Ring\n\nI've been in the very fortunate (or unfortunate!) position of having a bespoke engagement ring rebuilt from scratch (after a catastrophic failure, a long dispute with my original jeweller, an insurance claim and a new jeweller) so thought it would be helpful to anyone working with a jeweller on a bespoke ring to see how interpretations of the same design can vary between jewellers and also demonstrate what to look out for when refining a ring.\n\nThe overall design brief remained the same between version 1 and 2 of the ring - both rings are an oval sapphire on an 18kt gold tulip-inspired basket on a pave platinum band.\n\nI also included a photo to demonstrate what the consequences can look like if you have a very large and high profile solitaire stone on a very thin band as fair warning to everyone. It might not ever happen to you, but there's also a chance it will! (I never wore the original ring to work out, took it off to clean etc.)\n\n**Design 1**\n\n* Stone - Chosen from what was in stock. I was actually really happy with this stone as it was a lovely petrol / teal blue in sunlight. Had it not been lost after it's accident, I would have happily reset it. However, the only thing I wish I had known beforehand is that sapphires are darker once set which meant that sometimes it would appear inky / more navy like a traditional sapphire.\n* Band - This is a 1.5mm pave band, which is well below the minimum recommended width. I was never advised against this which I found disappointing as the jeweller is very highly rated. There is a gap on the shoulders where the pave starts and the basket is which I didn't think about at the time as someone who had never designed jewellery, but makes for quite an odd design choice and was refined by the 2nd jeweller for v2 of the ring. I loved the pave look from the top but another thing I didn't realise as a jewellery newbie is that from the side, the small stones jut up from the band so the top half of the ring looked thicker than the plain bottom half. This was something I ended up changing in the rebuild as a personal preference.\n* Profile - This is the thing I was most annoyed with from the original jeweller, this stone was very prominent from the band. This was never highlighted to me during the consultation and the sketches / digital renderings did not include any measurements and as a newbie to fine jewellery, I just assumed the jeweller knew best/would try to use the best proportions. I'd say the top of the ring sat at least 8 - 10mm above the band. The final ring was prone to spinning due to it's proportions and profile and definitely contributed to the snagging and final accident that led to the loss of the centre stone.\n\n**Design 2**\n\n* Stone - 1 of 6 sourced specifically for the project based on the measurements of the last stone. We chose to sacrifice carat weight here to get a precision cut stone with a more ideal top down proportion with similar face up measurements to the original stone (on paper, the depth of the stone is shallower than what is typically recommended, but actually meant the jeweller was able to set the stone much lower into the band and I don't think the colour has suffered for the cut!) I also ended up going for a lighter shade of blue here as I wanted the stone to be noticeably blue no matter what lighting it was under.\n* Band - The jeweller insisted on bulking up the band to 2.2mm - and I am so glad I took her advice on this. Overall very little visual difference on my finger and mentally I feel so much happier knowing the ring is more sturdy. The additional width meant she worked in a very thin channel-inspired setting on either side of the stones I'd never had thought of and I feel makes the side profile of the ring look cleaner. Cathedral added at my request here for additional security, but note that the pave goes right up the shoulders of the ring, with no gap between the pave stones and the centre stone. This ring moves a little on my finger but overall is much less prone to spinning.\n* Prongs - I actually did like bubble prongs on the original ring (which I know is controversial haha) but switched to claws in this iteration just as I felt it suited the overall design better,\n* Basket - I had never thought about this as I was originally quite happy with the basket on v1, however the new jeweller mentioned she thought it was bulky and really refined v2 of the basket so that it dominates the stone less. The petals can only be seen from the side and I love the way the cathedral shoulder join the basket. There is also a tiny bit of additional gold wire behind where the platinum shoulders meet the basket to reinforce the structure.\n* Profile - Much lower due to the shallower stone - this one sits 5mm over the band which is impressively low given the size of the sapphire."

I really hope that person ended up going because it was FUCKING FANTASTIC. Kaskade DESTROYED the place. One of the best sets I've seen in a long time, and presumably because of the renovations there was actually space to move around on the floor. \n\n\nThere were also women dressed as what I have to assume were bubble head nurses from silent hill dancing up in the rafters? It was strange but cool, very halloweeny.\n\n\nAnd this woman dancing in front of me most of the night was the most beautiful person I've ever seen, but that's neither here nor there.\n\n\nIf you hate Marquee maybe give it another shot now that they renovated, I have no complaints about last night."

    "selftext": "I know things took a turn with the podcast but I think the one thing that blows my mind is the gumption of her? She hasn’t listened to a podcast in her life, knows nothing about presenting, has shown that she has not a thought in her head, is unable to “prepare” and study as she doesn’t think it’s worth it. It really proves that being on social media takes a certain kind of person which is probably why most of them are classed as narcissistic and all claim to have adhd etc because I’m a highly skilled person in a very good job and I wouldn’t have the balls to just start doing a podcast when I’ve never even listened to one. I listen constantly to podcasts when I’m working out or walking the dog and even when I’m doing my cleaning. I really adore a good one- I can tell you I’ve listened to a few that have started by influencers and they are shite cos they live in a bubble and so the only people that listen to them are the people in that bubble which isn’t enough to sustain a podcast that will get money behind it from advertising etc. I very much look forward to her falling on her arse with it all. The influencers that have done them thus far I can’t even hate listen, I mean half the time I can’t even watch a full Teethy/beefy morning video cos she’s padding them out with yawns and repeating her stupid phrases- if you know you know!

Additional constraints, ssf, I don't plan to rush ubers (no slam helmet) and I don't reaaly feel the tainted pact setup, so not really planning to transition into those.\n\n  \nMain goal? Play around a week or so, do some t16, maybe try an uber or two, farm some bases, reroll something es.\n\n  \nChoices:\n\nEarthshatter zerker or slayer - probably best option, did it like thrice (last league, gauntlet, ssf restart), so kinda bored with this one. Ziz + Carn uploaded slayer version, Imexiles guide for zerker.\n\nBleed slams slayer - Seems similar enough to be strong, but different enough to have slightly different feel. Phaze's guide\n\nBoneshatter of complex trauma bleed - either Soul's jugg version (ZIz has a guide) or Alk had like super endgame dotcap pob for a slayer. This seems like the slowest for general gameplay, but probably the easiest to kill atleast some ubers?\n\n  \nAll and all, jugg kind afeels like the only thing the ascendancy gives is defense and action speed guarantee. Slayer seems much more appealing, but then whenever I enter temporal bubble of get grasping vined I feel like I'll be cursing the fact I didn't go with jugg. Earthshatter's qute fast, but the bleed slams have much more aoe and seem a bit more fun. On the other hand boneshatter's clear is probably going to be the worst, but jugg version is probably the easiest out of all those builds to kill atleast some ubers.\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

    "selftext": "Once again contributing a review that I intend to fit the requested review format on the wiki as best I can. We shall see how that goes. \n\nThese are the Rival RB11V Bag Gloves Size Large. I I used these as my sole bag gloves for boxing and kickboxing for five years, got these around my birthday in October 2019 and only stopped using them around January 2025. \n\nFit and comfort: This model of glove comes TIGHT. Like. This ain’t me being a baby. Even when I got a pair in XL down the road, they were still beyond super tight on the hand and fingers (not the tips or wrist though). Depth was fine on finger and thumb, a little space in the fingers disappears when making a full fist. There was a break in period to where now, these are molded to my hand. No more knocking knuckle issues, perfect adherence to my striking knuckles and thumb, no longer constrictive and are beyond comfortable. I believe the break in is worth the payout. Ergonomics don’t start strong but after the first couple of months of use, they became as great as they are now. The liner is applied nicely and there was no bunching to contend with. It is also comfortable against the skin. There is a mesh palm, which helps vent the hands well.  The microfiber material feels kinda solid, not pliable like leather, and not very smooth as it has a bit of grainy texturing to it. \n\nDurability and usefulness: over five years of daily driver use (and not taking care of them the best originally), these gloves are still perfectly usable with no concessions. The only blemish present on these gloves is where I rub the sweat from my beard on the thumb. These are made in China using a high quality microfiber material, so not true leather. Truth be told, these are as good if not better than some leather options I’ve had in the past. The stitching on everything is still perfectly intact, some threading on the logo for the left hand has rubbed up but it’s barely noticeable. The straps on the wrist lock system are still in perfect shape, the mesh on the palm as well. The Velcro is the best I’ve had in any glove, as gripping today as if I just got them out of the box. Additionally, these are bag glove only for a reason. I wouldn’t spar my worst enemies in these because it feels like fighting in brass knuckles lol. The padding absorbs most if not all shock and is comfy against my hand while still being mega stiff after all these years (good pop/feedback on the bag). Using these while nursing my original knuckle injuries let me know that these were perfect for protecting my hands through heavy bag work. These are still good to use for probably another 5 years it feels like lol, only the slightest bubble on the finger side of one glove. \n\nThese will hold smell if you aren’t careful in wiping and drying them out. You can also rescue them with sprays, dryers, and inserts if they do stink up. The wrist lock 2 is one of my favorite Velcro strap systems, super supportive and leaves me feeling… locked in lol. These started off tighter than any other glove I’ve used at this 12-14oz size, and stiffer than a cleto reyes, but wore in to be as comfortable in hand as a Phenom glove or a good 8-10oz fight glove. They feel painted on now when I slide my hands in. These are some of the most protective gloves I’ve used: allowing me to throw full power on a NAZO tarpaulin bag if I wanted. Rival sizing is strange, order these and prepare for a return if the sizing feels off. My XL pair felt tighter than the L did out of the box. Getting rid of my XL pair is what got me started on using this subreddit back in February of this year and I haven’t looked back since. \n\nTLDR: start off super stiff and tight in hand, wear in over time to become worth the wait. Some of the most protective bag gloves I’ve used. Comfortable in hand, not the most luxurious mind you, but up there. Super slim profile and compact to boot, similar to a fight glove in my opinion. If you can get past a break-in period, you’re good on a bag glove that can stand the test of time. If you want a small, mega stiff glove that is good for protecting your hands at a light weight and slim profile that also lasts forever, this one could suit ya. If you like bouncy responsiveness or a better punch-through feeling, might want to look somewhere else for a punchers glove. \n\nHappy to answer questions and make comparisons, I’ve used plenty of other gloves and don’t mind comparing. \n\nLink here: https://rivalboxing.us/products/rb11?variant=39411856244926"

    "selftext": "Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/diversify-before-you-get-spooked-edward-jones-ceo-s-halloween-lesson-for-investors](https://www.juniorstocks.com/diversify-before-you-get-spooked-edward-jones-ceo-s-halloween-lesson-for-investors)\n\nEdward Jones CEO Penny Pennington urges investors to resist the tech-stock temptation and embrace diversification as markets ride one of their strongest rallies in decades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4bau8h21hyf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=49949a7a359102c51dd848541b4916ec245503b2\n\nIf the stock market were a Halloween party, Big Tech would be the one showing up in a gold-plated costume. The crowd can’t take its eyes off it, yet Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington has a message for investors getting swept up in the spectacle: don’t dress up your portfolio as only a tech play.\n\nThe comment came during a Yahoo Finance interview on October 31, 2025, as markets closed out the month with optimism powered by heavyweights like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. After a blockbuster quarter that saw Amazon alone add $300 billion to its valuation thanks to strong cloud earnings, the euphoria is understandable. But Pennington’s advice cuts through the hype—diversification isn’t just an old-school cliché, it’s survival strategy in a market addicted to algorithms and AI headlines.\n\n**The Mag 7 and the Market’s Sweet Tooth**\n\nThere’s no denying it, tech has been the market’s rocket fuel. The so-called “Magnificent Seven”—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—have driven most of the S&P 500’s gains this year. Together, they’ve carried indices to near-record levels, feeding investor optimism that the AI boom is more revolution than bubble.\n\nYet history reminds us that no rally lasts forever. Pennington pointed out that this six-month surge ranks among the five strongest in 75 years. That’s a statistic worth celebrating, but also one that should make any investor pause before going all-in on one sector. “We think valuations are high, but they’re not at all-time highs,” she said, emphasizing that the economy remains strong, productivity gains from AI are real, and equities still have room to run—just not all in one direction.\n\n**The Discipline Behind Diversification**\n\nDiversification may sound boring compared to the dazzle of trillion-dollar market caps, but it’s the backbone of long-term wealth building. Pennington underscored that every client’s portfolio should reflect their risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon. “The rules of the road haven’t changed,” she said. “Invest according to your time horizon and the goals you’re trying to accomplish.”\n\nThat means keeping multiple sectors in play—from industrials and healthcare to financials and energy. It’s about balance, not bias. Investors who go too heavy on tech could find themselves spooked when volatility strikes, as it inevitably does. “Don’t dress up your portfolio as only a tech portfolio,” Pennington quipped. “You’re likely to get spooked when volatility rises and falls.”\n\n**Rebalancing When the Candy Runs Out**\n\nThe temptation to chase returns is as old as the market itself. When one sector outperforms so dramatically, portfolios can become overweighted without investors even realizing it. Pennington advocates for regular rebalancing—cutting gains from sectors that have sprinted ahead and reallocating to areas that have lagged.\n\n“Use a downdraft as an opportunity to cut some gains and reallocate to less favorable sectors,” she advised. The goal isn’t to time the market perfectly, but to maintain equilibrium amid shifting tides. In practice, that might mean trimming exposure to tech and adding to areas like consumer staples, healthcare, or dividend-paying blue chips that tend to hold steady when growth cools.\n\n**Why Emotion is the Real Enemy**\n\nBehind Pennington’s polished advice lies a deeper truth about investing: the biggest risk isn’t volatility—it’s emotion. The fear of missing out drives investors to chase trends at the top, while panic leads them to sell at the bottom. That’s where Edward Jones believes professional guidance matters most.\n\n“A good financial advisor works with you and your family to understand what’s most important,” she said. “They help put into perspective what’s happening in the markets and provide outlets for opportunity.” It’s a reminder that markets are rational only on paper. In reality, they’re human, messy, and emotional. Having someone to steady the wheel when the ride gets bumpy can make the difference between long-term success and short-term regret.\n\n**AI, Productivity, and the Next Leg Higher**\n\nWhile Pennington warns against tech obsession, she’s hardly bearish on innovation. On the contrary, she sees AI-driven productivity as a legitimate tailwind for the U.S. economy. The integration of AI into logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing is improving efficiency and profitability across industries, not just within Silicon Valley.\n\nThat broader adoption is precisely why diversification matters. As AI becomes embedded in every corner of the economy, investors can benefit through sectors that may not look “techy” at first glance—think infrastructure, energy, and even agriculture. The digital revolution isn’t confined to the Nasdaq; it’s rewriting the entire playbook of modern industry.\n\n**The Bottom Line: Balance is Bravery**\n\nIn a year when megacaps dominate headlines and double-digit gains fuel FOMO, Penny Pennington’s message is a steady hand on the tiller. Markets may be strong, but discipline and diversification remain timeless virtues.\n\nIt’s not about ignoring tech, it’s about resisting the urge to make it your entire identity. Just as Halloween costumes come off when the night ends, market fads eventually fade. The investors who keep their portfolios grounded—spreading risk, staying patient, and sticking to their plan—are the ones still holding candy when the lights come on.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDiversification isn’t just an investing principle; it’s an act of self-preservation. Tech and AI may continue to dominate the spotlight, but history favors the balanced investor. As Pennington put it, the rules of the road haven’t changed—know your goals, manage your risk, and remember that every rally eventually takes a breath. In the long run, steady beats flashy every time."

Her feed now looks like a mix of paid ads and escapism.\n\nDid she lose her passion for content creation, or is she just over it? 🤷‍♀️\n\nFeels like she’s living in some delulu bubble instead of the grounded, hardworking creator we first saw on YouTube and Instagram. I honestly miss that version of her — the one who seemed genuinely passionate about her craft.\n\nAnyone else feel like Aparna’s totally lost her content plot lately?"

So a boyfriend who is understanding and doesn’t beat around the bush with me (is direct) is required. And, I want a boyfriend who’s very emotionally intelligent. I also want him to be sweet, funny, kind, loyal, honest, weird (we can be weird together : D), asks for help and puts in the work to get better, and is empathetic to name a few things.\n\nOn a side note, I’d like to have a boyfriend who’s in the same time zone as me. Or at most 2 hours ahead or behind me. This is so it’d be easier to coordinate with eachother and talk. (My time zone is eastern USA)\n\nAlso, I don’t mind if you’re religious. (I personally believe in science and what I believe in is non-negotiable.) As long as you don’t force me to join your religion or your faith is hurting yourself or others.\n\nSomething else I should mention is that my personal preference for ethnicity for a boyfriend is white. I don’t mind if you’re another ethnicity it’s just a preference of mine.\n\nOkay that’s a LOT to say. Feel free to message me if you’d like to. Have a wonderful day everyone!"

The coins were not buried in multiple bubble mailers but, effectively wrapped and securely mounted, with a second label to boot.\n\nHow do these polymer based water fowl find their way here? (two of the them happened to be on the package) I think they love silver. Maybe it is these coins, the two 1974 Trade Units. \n\nNow I am new at collecting, but these coins are remarkable, such high relief on both sides, and truly captivating. It was your description of these coins that prompted me to buy them. I can't really remember what you wrote but I remember the feeling.\n\nEven my wife was mesmerised by them. She is difficult to impress, not kooks, pandas, not even lady Libertad.\n\nThanks for offering these remarkable coins and for your words that tipped me towards buying them.

I'm sure like 5 people remember my last post from a year ago where I broke down my entire strategy. I won't be doing that again, but here's an update on how it performed. Overall up +32% which is slightly better than QQQ's +29%. I didn't even come close to TQQQ's +63% this time around and the cause is pretty clear...\n\nXLP flopped big time. I know it's a hedge so in a way it's supposed to underperform when everything is at all time highs but to underperform THIS much? It felt like I was hedging my calls with puts. I could speculate that there's some global macroeconomic shift away from consumer staples or something but I didn't get here by doing that kind of DD. I just backtested historical returns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8oih97uutgyf1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e35321eff36d599934739ea8de4f8d9c0227c1\n\nOn an unrelated note, I find it hilarious that some haters bookmarked my post and showed up to say \"told you so\" around liberation day. Yeah I was down -$167k at the time but I've seen worse and that ended up being a nothing burger. Turns out when your calls have 1-2 years until expiry those temporary setbacks don't matter much.\n\nMoving forward, I think I'm done with options. I'm sure we've all seen those posts where people hit it big and make life changing money but don't know when to quit. There's this dismissive attitude like \"if you can't quit your day job right this instant then it's not enough money\" but that's just not true. All time (since 2018) I'm up +$415k which is a massive head start and is plenty to snowball into retirement from here even in shares. Maybe if my goal were to hit a high score of millions of dollars I'd keep YOLOing 50% of my portfolio into LEAPS every year but I just want a comfy normal life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6lgexe0vgyf1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b663478b678b636f52228f06b7ccf47cce7e70\n\nIf you backtest retirement strategies (which I've done a lot of) the ones that fail happen when you hit your target number due to some bubble, quit your job, then immediately stuff crashes back down like in 2000 or 2008.

    "selftext": "Prompt:\n\nThe Claymation Coffee Vista - Morning Genesis. Visual and Art Direction (for the entire clip): Craft a scene in the distinct style of classic stop-motion claymation, emphasizing a subtly 'step-frame' or 'jerky' animation quality rather than smooth motion, to enhance the handcrafted feel. Feature matte, handmade textures and subtle fingerprints visible on all surfaces, giving it a tangible, sculpted feel. Utilize a diverse, slightly desaturated, yet clearly distinct and balanced color palette. Incorporate rich, deep browns for the coffee, earthy tones and creams for the cup, lush greens, blues, and muted yellows/oranges for the sprawling natural vista (mountains, forests, sky). Avoid a monochromatic look; ensure clear color separation and vibrancy suitable for classic claymation. Lighting should be soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows, to emphasize the sculpted forms. The overall atmosphere should be charmingly imperfect, handcrafted, and grounded, highlighting the material's malleability and the tactile nature of clay. Audio Directive: No music is to be added to this clip. The audio should consist solely of satisfying, exaggerated claymation sound effects – squishing, stretching, settling, gentle bubbling/pouring sounds, and subtle ambient nature sounds (e.g., distant birds, soft breeze). Episode Flow (One Continuous Shot Description): Description: A continuous, wide, static shot from a slightly elevated perspective, overlooking a stunning, expansive claymation natural vista (e.g., rolling mountains, dense forests, a winding river, all rendered in textured clay). In the foreground, there's a simple, flat, textured clay surface (like a rock ledge or a wooden table edge) perfectly positioned to enjoy the view. The background features a vast, textured clay sky with soft, muted clouds. The focus is initially on the empty foreground ledge. The animation within the clip should subtly convey a stop-motion feel. Phase 1 (Initial State - Empty Ledge & Vista): The shot begins with the empty claymation ledge in the foreground, with the beautiful, untouched claymation vista stretching out behind it. Phase 2 (Coffee Cup Emergence & Steam Formation): From the center of the foreground ledge, lumps and forms of clay rapidly begin to rise, flow, and expand upwards. This emerging form organically stretches, twists, and sculpts itself with remarkable elasticity and fluidity, quickly forming a detailed claymation coffee cup (e.g., in cream or earthy tones) complete with a handle. As the cup solidifies, a rich, dark brown clay liquid (the coffee) organically fills it. Immediately, subtle, translucent, wispy forms of white or light grey clay begin to gently rise and curl above the coffee, representing steaming vapor that dynamically forms and dissipates in the stop-motion style. The cup and coffee grow vertically through this dynamic, flowing movement, its diverse colors and details appearing as the clay stretches and solidifies into shape. The accompanying sound effects are satisfying squishes, stretches, and a gentle bubbling/filling sound. Phase 3 (Final State - Fully Formed Coffee & Steam): The magnificent claymation steaming cup of coffee stands fully formed and detailed on the ledge. The cup is perfectly sculpted, filled with rich brown clay coffee, and delicate, wispy clay steam curls convincingly above it. It proudly overlooks the stunning claymation natural vista, showcasing a rich, diverse, yet desaturated color palette. Visible clay textures are prominent, as if it has just finished organically growing and assembling itself. The final audio settles into subtle ambient nature sounds, perhaps a soft, gentle breeze."

One day I was washing my face and my cleanser doesn’t get soapy at all but when I was putting it on my face, it started making bubbles so I thought oh maybe I still have soap on my hands. So I went to go rinse them off again and I found that no matter how hard I rinsed there was still soap residue left on my hands. So ever since then, I’d make sure to thoroughly rinse my hands. But no matter how hard I try nothing works. I’ve tried cold water. I’ve tried warm water. I’ve tried hot water. I have a water filter. I’ve tried different soaps. I’ve tried using less soap. It’s been going on for like two years now. It’s fucking annoying. My mom doesn’t seem to have a problem, but after she washes her hands, she just dries them which is what I used to do but ever since finding soap was staying on my hands I’ll wait until they’re damp and then rub them together to see if they’re still soapy and surely enough there is always soap left on them. It literally looks like I just added more soap.  A lot of times I feel like I can’t even wash my face with my hands anymore because I’m just washing it with hand soap. "

I just want to make a lot of money on a correction if and when that happens. \n\nI’ve been doing a lot of research into trying to understand roughly when we can expect a top in this market and then a crash. All my research focuses on two things being needed for a proper 1-3 year bear market to happen. 1st, Fed increasing rates and 2nd extreme amounts of margin debt.\n\nThe Fed is cutting rates at the moment and the orange haired man will surly swap Powell out with someone that will cut further which is great for the short term. But I’m predicting inflation will increase in a big way some time next year and the only option will be to increase rates. In my opinion this will be a major sign a top. \n\nMy question is what are “extreme” levels of margin debt? Before the great depression crash margin debt was 8.4% of gdp, before the dotcom crash and the 2008 crash it was 3% of gdp. As of September 2025 we are at 3.86% of gdp and have been increasing each month by 0.2%.\n\nI’ve heard from experts that this margin debt isn’t at extreme levels but I’m wondering what is extreme levels in your opinion? \n\n"

For a moment I thought adulthood was going smoothly.\n\nHalfway through packing came the plot twist:\n\nMadam, sofa is heavy. Building lift small. Extra 3000 needed.\n\nIn that moment my soul quietly stepped aside and watched my bank balance cry.\n\nNobody fought.\nNobody misbehaved.\nJust a classic India moment where the real shift happens in your expectations, not your furniture.\n\nI politely reminded them of the fixed quote.\nThey discussed among themselves and continued the work.\nDelivery was a day late, one small scratch on my bike, and a slightly tired heart.\nNot a disaster. Not a fairy tale. Just real life.\n\nMeanwhile society also entered the chat.\nNeighbour aunt observed everything as if watching a reality show.\n\nBeta you are moving alone? No brother or husband helping? Very brave.\n\nNo aunt. Just financially stable, emotionally tired, and determined to do life on my own timeline.\n\nBy the end I learned:\n\n• Platforms are improving but surprises still exist\n• Movers try their best but negotiations appear like jump scares\n• Bubble wrap protects things better than society protects your peace\n• Independence in India sometimes gets more commentary than your home delivery date\n\nNot blaming any company.\nNot ranting.\nJust saying shifting teaches emotional flexibility along with furniture mobility.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHas anyone actually had a perfectly smooth shifting experience in India.\nOr is one surprise charge and a mini emotional roller coaster simply part of the package now?"

Excerpt:\n\n\"One evening, Dad came home from work riled up by Rush over Japan. A massive economic bubble in Japan had driven up their stock and real estate, and money continued to pour into the country’s coffers from the electronics and automobiles they were selling to us Americans. Japanese companies bought Columbia Pictures, Pebble Beach Golf Resort, and the Chrysler Building. A wave of anti-Japanese sentiment began to grow. He’d heard from Rush that now Mitsubishi was purchasing the Rockefeller Center, and said something I haven’t forgotten.  \n  \n“Maybe we’ll just have to drop a bomb on them again, I don’t know.” Hiroshima and Nagasaki were topics I had been learning about in school. I’d seen photos of the burned, the dead. And in the 1980s, there was an ever-present and palpable fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, even for kids. Especially for kids.\n\nSo even at 9 or 10, I knew it was a certifiably insane thing to say.\""

    "selftext": "So, people blame right wing to be anti-science or anti-evidence, but it is not the alone to share the blame here. Left wing is guilty of that too.\n\nCase in point\n- Rental prices.\n\nRent is a function of demand and supply, other than collision cases of RealPage, rents are mostly a form of costs + profit, and matching demand + supply.\n\nThen there are separate cases like NYC, where I actually support rent stabilization (different from frozen rents or rent control), and some form of rent control for seniors or those on a fixed income. NYC is a global city, and prices will keep rising, just because there's always going to be global interest in buying property there, more often than not, to the detriment of its residents.\n\nMinneapolis mayoral race, one candidate is running on introducing rent control or rent stabilization. And although, I'm no fan of Frey, I'm not a fan of Fateh either - especially on issues of housing affordability. On issues of policing, protest handling, and homeless population increasing slightly, I don't know much to comment on their published plans. But nobody is promising more building of available housing. Rents and housing prices remain stable when the supply is about 3-5% more or less than the demand.\n\nAustin controlled is housing prices and rents, by building out at an insane pace, and although it was also added by the tech bubble fizzling out, a major portion of control effectiveness was not any form of control, just issuing building permits.\n\nSimilarly for public transit or higher density housing building permissions. California NIMBYs are the worst batch that there is. Instead, controls and stabilizations is what's offered by almost every candidate in nearly all the big cities in California.\n\n- Nuclear Power.\n\nIt is safe. Far far more safer than coal, and still far more safer than even gas. Still the anti-nuclear stand, of mostly leftists irritate me to no end. It is more environmentally friendly than hydropower, which causes issues with local wildlife and flora.\n\nIt is expensive to build, because of stupid processes and regulations. You shouldn't be able to sue a nuclear plant project in Atlanta if you live in New York. Only allowed if you're living, say within 150-200 miles of the project.\n\nYou can't be pro-climate and anti-nuclear. If you are, you're just a brainless git.\n\n- AntiGMO\n\nGMO crops and plants are some of the best innovation of the modern world. Naturally disease resistant that wiped out non-GMO crops, needing less and less pesticides and insecticides? Hell yeah! \"Organic\" foodstuffs, more often than GMO foods, have a far higher residual concentration of allowed pesticides.\n---------------\n\nNow, this does not mean right wing gets a pass either. Anti-vac nutjobs, anti-COVID dumbasses are far higher in number on the political right, and to be honest, theirs is actually more serious, because their anti-science and anti-evidence stances are more fatal.\n\n"

    "selftext": "***Stories from the Red Code: Old Moose*** is a story delivered by German brothers Richi and Gunther. It is one three issues in the series, Stories from the Red Code. The series were published in early 2024. The first story, *Old Moose*. follows a robot named nothing and an \"Un-tress\" named Ashavya as they travel to awaken a monolithic creature named Old Moose and traverse to destinations unknown. All of that is accomplished in 7 pages or less, yet it feels like we spent way more time with the issue. Much of that may be due to the writing. Old Moose and its two sister issues together are the stuff of a young Comikas/Mangakas wet dreams. They've got depth, yet the content is approachable, if not at times reproachable. Frankly, *Old Moose* feels like a love letter to suicide, razor-blading edition, which, warning is heavily traversed in the writing and visuals. Despite that, none of the discourse presented feels like it invites debate. It's brief. And instead of weighty dialogues, the reader is invited into Ashavya personal experience with the subject, which lands well and begs further meditation.\n\n*Old Moose*'s technical construction may find similar merits with readers. The lettering is not fumbled, bubbling is unobtrusive, the line work is clean and flat yet manages to endear a rugged rough tone that is greatly aided by inky shadows. Those shadows never fail to impart a sinister atmosphere to every panel, which are a joy to swoon over. Readers may find themselves absorbed in each one trying to guess a history that could have birthed the landscape that they offer. Likewise, the coloring is not ineffective and contrasts the shading well and feels like it imparts hope in places the tone of the visuals and verbal storytelling are devoid of. We left *Stories from the Red Code: Old Moose* with a lot of questions that we hoped following issues would answer and a quiet dread that we couldn't shake easily. We suspect that Veteran readers won't miss the youth in this and the other issues in the series and freshmen readers may never appreciate it.\n\nCaution:\n\nThe themes present in this work may challenge your belief systems.\n\n* There is blood.\n* It Explores suicide.\n* There are traumatic situations.\n\nRead: [https://globalcomix.com/c/stories-from-the-red-code](https://globalcomix.com/c/stories-from-the-red-code)\n\nHey, We're a novice reviewer. If we made any errors, please be gentle with your guidance. THNX for your considerations. Take Care. 😁"

    "selftext": "Some fans might not like this, and I’m not sure why. If you look at the overall roster and the product on the ice you know this team has a long way to go before becoming a playoff team. With that being said, this might be a very good sellers market around the deadline this year. \n\nThere’s at least 20 teams I can see contending for playoff spots, with maybe a few more wanting to add to get in and get more growth and experience for rookies/younger players. \n\nYou have the usuals in Carolina, Washington, Tampa, Florida, and Toronto in the east. Winnipeg, Colorado, Vegas, LA, Dallas, Edmonton, and Minnesota in the west. \n\nAlso some up and coming young teams like New Jersey, Detroit, Montreal, Ottawa(still kinda young), and Columbus in the east. Utah, Seattle, Chicago, and Anaheim in the west. \n\nI’m not sure what to make of the Rangers, Penguins, Canucks, or Blues. I think they should all look to the future because their rosters clearly need a refresh, but those organizations, especially in recent years, usually don’t go that way and prefer to always take the win now approach. The Rangers just made Mike Sullivan the highest paid coach in history and also have Igor’s massive extension on the books now, Pittsburgh hasn’t tanked in over 20 years and unless they trade Crosby you can never fully count them out. Vancouver doesn’t seem to ever think tanking and getting a high pick will help them, and St Louis prefers to trade their high picks(or offer sheet) for established NHL talent.\n\nThat leaves Philly, Boston, Buffalo, and the Islanders in the east. Nashville, San Jose, and Calgary in the west. Don’t think I missed any teams. \n\nPhilly, Buffalo, and San Jose are all very young and should want to surround their young talent with quality players to help with their development, so I can’t see them selling off much of anything come deadline time unless someone made a crazy offer for one of their players(Alex Tuch might be worth it if he won’t resign in Buffalo)\n\nSo that leaves Boston, Islanders, Nashville, and Calgary looking like the only true sellers this year. \n\nBostons players available should be:\nViktor Arvidsson\nAndrew Peeke\nSean Kuraly\nHenri Jokiharju\n\nNothing that would fetch a big return\n\nNashville’s players available should be:\n\nMichael Bunting\nErik Haula\nRyan O’Reilly\nMichael Mccaron\nNicklaus Perbix\nNick Blankenburg\n\nBunting, Haula, and O’Reilly should fetch decent returns\n\nCalgarys players available should be:\n\nBlake Coleman\nRyan Lomberg\nRasmus Andersson\nJoel Hanley\nJake Bean\n\nAndersson probably gets a 1st round picks, maybe Coleman too\n\nThat brings us to the Islanders\n\nTheir players available should be:\n\nAnders Lee\nJG Pageau\nKyle Palmieri\nCasey Cizikas\nMax Tsyplakov\nTony Deangelo\nDavid Rittich(if Varly ever comes back)\n\nAlso gauge the market on:\n\nAnthony Duclair\nPierre Engvall (lol)\nRyan Pulock\nScott Mayfield (also lol)\n\nLee, Pageau, and Palmieri would be 3 of probably the top 5 forwards on the market unless something crazy happens somewhere(looking at you Crosby and Malkin) and those 3 guys are the players teams are always looking to add come playoff time. Proven veteran performs that can center a 3rd line(Pageau), Kill penalties(Pageau, Palmieri) help on the Powerplay (Palmieri, Lee) or provide regular forward depth. \n\nCizikas would be a depth add and nothing much more than that, teams love centers that can win draws and PK, but Pageau should be worth more because he provides something offensively aswell\n\nTsyplakov would be like an Andrei Kuzmenko prove it trade\n\nTony D can get sent to the moon for all I care\n\nRittich only goes if Varly comes back or someone makes a good offer for him\n\nDuclair doesn’t have the skills to create on a line, he needs someone highly skilled to create for him(which the isles don’t have) so he could get close to the 30 goals he scored playing with Barkov in Florida, maybe a team would think about that\n\nPierre Engvall and Scott Mayfield would be cap dumps and they’re both barely NHL players at this point, maybe a team needs to reach the floor\n\nRyan Pulock seems to have absolutely fallen off a cliff the last couple of years. Injuries probably played a part but he’s not close to the player he was during the bubble playoff runs. If a team calls about him, Darche should answer and have a long conversation because 5 more years of him declining at this rate might have him looking worse than Scott Mayfield out there sooner rather than later. \n\nI really can’t see any of these guys I mentioned being a big part of the future 2-3 years from now when this team might be ready to push for a playoff spot again, so the cord should be cut this year and make room for a youth movement \n\nAnd to wrap it all up, if there was ever an incentive for tanking a season, Gavin McKenna looks awesome, and a player like him would accelerate a rebuild. \n\n\nTL:DR Team needs to embrace selling because there’s looking to be a lot of buyers at this years deadline. Should be able to get some good returns for the players on expiring or 2-3 year contracts that won’t be a part of the future anyway.\n\nApologies for any spelling/grammar issues.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!"

Which I totally get is normal, I asked one of my friends who was previously pregnant, and she said she didn't start showing until 20 weeks. But I was plus size at the start of this pregnancy and I've started to feel super self conscious because I feel like the weight gain has all settled in my stomach area, and no bump to kind of \"even\" it out.\n\nI've been managing my thoughts about this, but last night, I saw a couple of family members and one of them just UP and put their hand on my belly, but it was on my stomach, not my bump, bc I don't have a bump. And I was so taken aback - I didn't say anything, tried to laugh it off and we all moved on with the night. But with the hormones raging now, I mainly just want to cry when I think about it bc I don't \"look\" pregnant and I just feel fat, and I got touched without my consent (which also re-highlighted my insecurity about my body right now) 😭  \n\nHow did y'all handle the really excited and well meaning family members that just kinda put the baby and your bump in the forefront? This is the second time that a family member has put their hands on my belly, but the first one at least asked. I was still slightly uncomfortable about it though..\nI know I should probably say something next time, but I'm so bad with any kind of confrontation and don't want to like, burst their bubble of excitement, even if I am trying to uphold my boundaries :/"

I pulled some opinion pieces and articles, but the first couple happen to be published in Israeli or Jewish press, and for them, that is some kind of \"too biased, so I will read it looking for bias\" trigger. I struggle myself with finding news at this point, just general national and world news, and I think for a bunch of people in my blue bubble, the problem is that the media is eroding their perspective, and I can't find a way through.  \nHave you found articles or other approaches that can get through their assumption of \"Israeli bias\" about NYC politics or media antisemitism? ETA: I am having similar issues with discussion with other Jewish friends who just don't seem to  have the bandwidth to rip apart their concept of the media, in both the US and the UK (BBC, Guardian)\n\nI'm not looking for \"don't waste your time with them\" kinds of responses- my question isn't about my investment in the conversation, it is about how to get them thinking more, or shift their perspectives a bit.

The origin-of-life field is in total gridlock.\nEvery “promising” pathway from chemistry to biology turns out to be another mirage. The more we learn, the more absurd it looks to imagine that random molecules just booted up replication, metabolism, and code all on their own. It’s not just improbable - it’s conceptually impossible given what we know about thermodynamics, information, and chemical kinetics.\n\n2. The AI hype train runs on metaphysics, not code.\nWhy do investors, scientists, and futurists need AI to become conscious? Because for materialism, it’s a foregone conclusion: if mind = matter, then matter + compute = mind. But that’s not science - that’s dogma in a lab coat.\n\nWhen the funding dries up and the “general intelligence” that was always “five years away” still doesn’t appear, we might have to face a deeper possibility:\nmaybe life and consciousness don’t emerge from matter - maybe matter emerges within consciousness.\n\nThe real singularity won’t be artificial. It’ll be philosophical."

    "selftext": "September 10, 2020\n\nClare Farrell is a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and co-editor of the movement’s handbook This Is Not A Drill. Below, she responds to press criticism of XR following the group’s blockading of News Corp’s printing presses.\n\nSince we blocked News Corp’s printing presses on Friday night, the right-wing media have been trying to place us firmly on one side of the culture war. But Extinction Rebellion has never been about being “woke” – at least, not in the sense weaponised by the right to stoke polarised conflict.\n\nThe claims made this week that Extinction Rebellion poses a threat to the UK’s way of life is a deliberate tactic to maintain a high fear environment. They aim to divide, leaving us unable to come together in collective determination to overcome the tyranny of those few who hope to cancel the future for short-term profit.\n\nWe’ve been hit with some highly absurd but predictable low-blows this week after goading one of the most powerful men on the planet, Rupert Murdoch. The press are closing ranks with the government and seeking to humiliate and expose XR activists, those beautiful, disobedient human beings, compared this week to the Suffragettes.\n\nPolice Tried to Ban XR from Saving the Planet – They Lost\nWe did not set up XR to create a home for anarchists, communists, socialists or capitalists to debate their political ideology. In fact, we ask each other to keep our isms in our pockets and meet other human beings on a level we all understand: being alive and wanting to live, wanting everyone on Earth to be able to live.\n\nThe polarising propaganda technique adopted by elite-owned media empires is the very antithesis of Extinction Rebellion’s clarion call to unite across difference, to sit around the same table and engage in dialogue – as difficult as that may be.\nWe are preparing to collectively let go of old certainties – the belief that power can only be measured in units of control, not liberation. It’s wildly ambitious, but why be limited by what seems politically realistic when we could be so close to losing control of our biosphere and all that supports life on Earth?\n\nThe physics of climate science is not a matter for opinionated debate – how to go about getting our emissions down and reversing biodiversity loss is the debate. Extinction Rebellion want to give that responsibility to the most inclusive and democratic political mechanism, made up of ordinary citizens: a Citizens’ Assembly. The UK just ran one, but the scope was not in line with the scale of the crisis; four weekends to deliberate the potential collapse of civilisation doesn’t seem like quite enough time to me.\n\nCheck out the French Citizens’ Convention for Ecological Transition if you want to see one done well. There, 150 ordinary citizens recommended that the government should come up with a fresh vision of how to run an economy, enshrine ecocide law and amend the constitution to guarantee protection of biodiversity and serious climate action.\n\nWe have to be for something, not just against things. In a Citizens’ Assembly, we have a political solution by which to make difficult decisions, and in the proposed Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill we have a means to make it possible. We have passed this to politicians to help them out of a tight spot, because in the face of this situation they clearly don’t know what the fuck to do.\n\nInequality, oppression, polarisation and the success of the divide-and-rule tactics of our corporate media, government and institutions must be overcome if our species is to stand a chance of beating the dire odds we’ve been given in the face of climate and ecological crises. Standing up for justice and equality does not mean standing for the silencing of others, or for the shutting down of debate and free speech. It means educating ourselves on reparatory justice and racial justice.\n\nIn my opinion, the right-wing papers and TV pundits are correct to question the risks of totalitarian world views and cancel culture, but those are not risks posed by Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThe call to go Beyond Politics describes moving into a paradigm where we are not fighting political battles for political parties, or arguing for what’s best on the basis of our personal beliefs, but are instead open to a process that is evidence-based, fair and representative. An emergency injection of democracy into our degraded Westminster bubble. Because our democracy is not in good enough shape to deal with this killer combination of crises.\n\nWe need to learn, be curious, be open to listening and transformation through grief. We must be willing to be vulnerable, to absolutely feel what it is like to face the reality of the circumstances we are in. We must be detached from the outcomes of our actions because we know we are doing all that we can – in peace and nonviolence, in joy and grief. Turning the rage at the horror of where we are now into the determination of stepping into our own power.\n\nOur leaders are catastrophically failing us, and the systems they are a part of simply cannot do what is needed right now. We need very different leadership – and along with a functioning democracy, a truly free press.\n"

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m 14 and fascinated by consciousness. I’ve been developing the \"Bubble Model\" to explain how the mind organizes perception, emotion, and will. I’d love to hear your thoughts and whether this framework helps make sense of conscious experience.\n\nBubble model  \n\nThe bubble model detunes itself into an emergent property of the mind. Example, waters molecules emergent properties are being wet and a clear fluid, the mind property is a space only observable to the container (Brain). This space only provides proof of existence in that we can observe it ourselves. Furthermore, this model is put into hierarchical order which I will further demonstrate. \n\nPhysical bubble > Will bubble > Sub bubbles(emotion) \n\nThink of each bubble as a container in sequential order the one with higher value represents as a container to the next.  \n\nThe physical bubble represents matter that everyone can objectively observe which is the brain, neurons etc. This is what creates emergent systems like a main gear in a machine moving everything forward or an electric outlet powering a machine. Consequentially this leads to emergent systems like will, influenced by the sub bubbles in it which are made by biological factors like emotions during birth and experiential factors like during life. \n\nThese sub bubbles have different behavioral factors they can react with each other, overwrite each other for example if we define two bubbles as happiness and desire the reaction creates greed. \n\nQualia, in simpler terms known as subjective experience, but we never perceive reality as fully true or in synch since different signal inputs like light, touch and sound come at different speeds. Everything would be out of tune, which is why the brain synchronizes everything in a delusionist path. What i mean by a delusionist path is that for example what we see might not be the true “it” or we touch isn't the surface but a made-up signal to ensure efficiency. \n\nA connection to the bubble model would be every input or signal (emotion) is a fixed set variable with a defined function. The function can blend anew, overwrite, depending on the containers' feedback. So the summary is since everything is in a fixed function morphed by survival efficiency observation might not be the true “it”. "

    "selftext": "That Friday we headed to Clarence once again. Outside of the music on the radio the car ride was pointedly quieter than usual, less chatty. Nobody said what everyone was thinking, but perhaps it was for the best. A deluge of comments and concerns wouldn’t prevent Dad from finding more dead animals. So we all acted like everything was business as usual. As we passed the  “Welcome to Clarence! Population: 804,” sign, thoughts of the monster that had been congregating in my mind all week began to swarm.\n\nWe turned from the old sun baked road and onto the dirt drive way. Whatever cheery ambient banjo music my brain normally played when we arrived at farm was silent. I only heard the tires as they crunched over rocks.\n\nOnce we got settled in, Dad told Mom and I to go do our usual grocery shopping. While we were gone he planned to go around the pine rows in Bear and “take a look around” which we all knew meant “search for carcasses.” He assured us he would be fine, putting our minds at ease with a dad joke about his shotgun riding shotgun. \n\nSo Mom and I went by the Piggly Wiggly in Clarence. The same old lady from last time was at the front, greeting us when we walked in. Mom gave me half the grocery list so we could divide and conquer. She wanted to get back to the farmhouse, she didn’t like the idea of Dad out there by himself.\n\nRounding the corner I went to dodge the bread display but it wasn’t there. I proceeded down the list until I had completed my scavenger hunt, meeting back up with Mom. We checked out, the nice older lady remembering us from last time, and striking up conversation with Mom. I zoned out.\n\n*Maybe the movie tropes were true and it only transformed under a full moon. It wasn’t a full moon this weekend, but it wasn’t a full moon last weekend either, and Dad said the Bobcat was fresh. So what if it was there? Would Dad find more dead animals? Were we really safe like Dad said? What if now it knew we were coming out there and tried to eat us?*\n\nMy thoughts were fitful and aimless. The swarm constructing a hive. \n\nBefore I knew it we were back at the farmhouse. From the look on Mom’s face I could see that the same swarm had built a hive in her brain as well. We watched Dad emerge from the front porch as we pulled up. He gave us a wave, his smile seemed hopeful as he approached.\n\n“Good news. I went around the pines and didn’t see any signs of the big nasty varmint.” Dad said ruffling my hair. \n\n“Really? Peter, do you think maybe it’s wandered off somewhere else?” \n\nHe clicked his tongue, “Eh, I don’t think so, but who knows. I mean I hope so, that would be great.”\n\n“Yeah, let some other bum bury dead animals.” I jeered.\n\n“Yeah!” Dad jeered with me. \n\n“Maybe that big ugly thing went off and died somewhere!”\n\n“Yeah!”\n\nMom chuckled, “You two are a couple of clowns. Now can I get some help with the rest of these groceries please?” Dad walked past me to grab an armful of groceries, bumping me over playfully. I laughed, trying and failing to push him over in return. \n\nDespite the swarm, and all the apprehension built up in my gut, I couldn’t help but want to try and carry on as usual, to treat this weekend like a normal weekend. At least until I was given a reason not to.\n\nThe rest of that weekend was like a dream. Friday afternoon I helped Mom with some chores, and then I played outside, finishing the carving in my oak tree, building little houses for fairies with sticks. I saw the cats running around the farm like they normally do. No longer lingering near the Kitty Cat Barn like they were last week. They frolicked in the clovers, basked in the warm rays of sunlight. I enjoyed watching them. That night there was a glorious heavy rain. Mom made a hot beef stew, hearty and savory. \n\nTucked in that night I was tired and my belly was full. I wouldn’t have seen anything out the window anyway, so I didn’t look. The tin roof sang me to sleep. \n\nSaturday was more of the same Arcadian bliss. Aunt Cheryl came to visit on Saturday. She was Mom’s older sister, and while we loved Aunt Cheryl, Dad had taught me to make myself busy when she came around. Poor Mom was left to pull up a chair and listen. She was twice divorced, and at the time she was dating Mr. Neal. She had leathery bronze skin and bleach blonde hair, and smelled like shea butter hand lotion. \n\nMom and Aunt Cheryl sat on the porch, and I played in the yard with some Barbie dolls pretending I was extremely busy. They talked about the cold front coming in next week, Aunt Cheryl’s work at the dentist’s office, Aunt Cheryl’s most recent ex-husband’s new girlfriend, Aunt Cheryl’s problems with her heart burn, and Aunt Cheryl’s plans for dinner that night. When Aunt Cheryl went to take a sip of her drink to oil the wheels on her trap, Mom finally got a word in. She said it in a hush, in case I was listening. Which I was.\n\n“Cheryl you haven’t heard anything new recently, you know about the animal attacks?”\n\nAunt Cheryl responded at full volume.\n\n“Shit, not since you told me about the dead animals y'all found, honey. And Neal hadn’t said nothing about it, but you know Neal. He’s the tall dark and mysterious type. Ya know I told him he needs to quit slouchin’ but he don’t listen to me-“\n\nThe conversation trailed off, and a small budding sense of hope began to take root within me. No news was good news, right?\n\nThat night, against my better judgement, I slowly eased myself out of bed to peer out the window. I couldn’t help but to shiver when I imagined what I might see. Despite my unease, I was only greeted with the cats, loitering around the small gardening barn, stalking mice among flower bushes. A barn owl called from one of the pecan trees.\n\nI felt that bud of hopefulness start to blossom. \n\nWe drove home on Sunday, and I couldn’t help but to feel disarmed as I peered out the window, admiring the scenery like I used to.\n\nIf only I knew how much danger I would soon be in.\n\nThe week was filled with delightful tedium. School, homework, a couple afternoons at friends’ houses. I hadn’t told any of my them about the slew of dead animals we had found in Clarence, what I had seen in the pine rows, or much less my werewolf theory. \n\nBefore all of this started I  had asked Mom and Dad if we could to take a friend with us one weekend. They responded positively to that, but I was sure that wasn’t the case now. I had a feeling it would be a while before either of them felt comfortable with that, but if the beast stayed away, then maybe they would become open to the idea again.\n\nI pondered these thoughts as we pulled up to Piggly Wiggly that Friday. We decided to stop by on the way in to town. Dad was running by the hardware store, something about brackets for some roof mounted lights for Bear.\n\nMom gave me half of the grocery list. As I looked it over, I turned the corner to go down the next aisle and almost bumped into it. The bread display. Once we finished our shopping, we checked out and met Dad by the car. When we asked him if he found the part he was looking for, he began to rant about the hardware store never having what he needed. From there we headed to the farm. \n\nWe pulled up to farmhouse, in good spirits as we unloaded groceries. Once we finished l Mom said I could go play until dinner time, so long as she could see me from the house; but before I could shoot out into the yard, Dad whistled for my attention. \n\n“Ey! Before you go play, I need you to go feed those cats. They probably need a refill. Make sure they got clean water too.”\n\nMom and Dad exchanged looks. The Kitty Cat Barn wasn’t in view of the windows.\n\n“Don’t worry Lori, I’m headed over to the shop barn, I’ll be able to keep an eye on her until she can get back into your line of sight.”\n\nI heard Dad whisper something to her under his breath about responsibility, before he came over affectionately grabbing my shoulders as he walked with me to the shop barn. I waited by the door while he fetched me a little bag of cat food and then sent me on my way. I could feel his gaze on me until I was out of sight. \n\nThere were about 10 cats living in the Kitty Cat Barn at a time, not including their kittens. All of them were Nanny’s strays.\n\nDespite knowing they were regularly checked on by Mrs Kerry, I still worried about them, especially out in the wild with some beast on the loose. Though, I felt like a werewolf eating a cat was equivalent to me eating a singular popcorn shrimp. I wasn’t sure if the cats knew that, but perhaps they felt better in the Kitty Cat Barn, being popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.\n\nI wrapped my fingers around the lopsided wire-paneled door that bowed on its hinges, allowing the cats easy entry. I stepped through the threshold an initial response of relief to see glimmering eyes shining at me through the musty darkness. However, I was then horrified by the fact that they were *all* there. More than 10, probably 20, all tucked into the shelves, hiding. I stopped dead in my tracks, and stayed dead there for a minute, trying to process what this may have meant, why they were there. Unfortunately, I had an idea. I tried to push through the motions, moving on to the task at hand. I fed them, and they graciously came down to eat. I used the hose to clean their bowl and they gladly drank. I was hopeful that maybe they were just still spooked by “something,” and that perhaps some food and drink would help them perk up. But once they had eaten and drank their fill, they just jumped right back onto their shelves, tucking themselves in like books. Dozens of eyes, pairs of wide luminous globes staring at me with feral transparency. \n\n*You need to run. You need to hide.* \n\nI would have gone straight to Dad to report this, but I heard the air compressor running, and I knew that meant “busy,” so I came running back into the house.\n\n“Mom! Mom! The cats are all hiding in the Kitty Cat Barn!”\n\n“What?” She said peaking her head out from doorway to the kitchen.\n\n“There are like 20 cats hiding in the barn, Mom! I-“ \n\nI paused for a moment, staring out the window.\n\n“I think they might be hiding from the werewolf!”\n\nThere was a beat of silence.\n\n“Amy-“ Mom huffed, “come here.”\n\nI did as she said, any fearful wind in my sails shadowed by the threat of a scolding from my mother. I walked timidly into the kitchen as she finished washing her hands, wiping them on her apron before placing them on my shoulders.\n\n“Amy, sweetheart. There was, or is, an animal out there. Absolutely. We don’t know if it’s a wolf or a bear, but we know that it’s one of the two.”\n\nShe knew I disagreed, but my better judgement had me keep my mouth shut.\n\n“You are a good girl Amy, and I know you’re not lying to me. Now whether you did see something out there or maybe dreamed it, it doesn’t matter. It scared you, and it would’ve scared me too! I don’t want you to think I don’t believe that you saw what you think you saw, okay? I do. But it’s just not a werewolf, honey, okay? Werewolves are not real.”\n\nShe said all of this firmly but, kindly, warmly. With a yearning for understanding in her eyes. \n\nI loved my Mom, so much. I gave her a small smile. Nodding. \n\n“Are we in agreement then?”\n\nI nodded.\n\nI wondered if I should start taking into consideration that this wasn’t a werewolf, and that she was probably right. The very thought caused me to psychologically squirm, but maybe I really did just have a nightmare.\n\nThat night I laid in bed, kissed and tucked in under fresh linens. Prayers said. I tossed and turned for half an hour before I knocked on the door to Mom and Dad’s room. Pitifully declaring,\n\n“I can’t sleep.” \n\nMom lovingly embraced me, probably glad I hadn’t come bursting in about seeing a werewolf. She tucked me back into bed and brought me a glass of warm milk to help me relax. It calmed me enough that when she asked if I was comfortable enough for her to go back to bed, that I said yes. She kissed my forehead, telling me goodnight, and I was suddenly alone again. Warm and snug under the covers, but still awake, staring at the ceiling. \n\n*Were the cats still huddled in the barn? How long would they cower in there?* \n\nI turned to look over at the window, until slowly I got up. \n\nI peaked out the window. One of the flood lights was on the garden barn. Dad had started leaving it on since burying those animals with Mr Voss. Its light cast shadows on the yard and it’s various shrubs and garden beds. I didn’t see any of the cats. None of them played around in the grass or slinked about in the shadows. I sighed, climbing back into bed. I hadn’t laid back down for more than 15 minutes, sleep’s spell almost cast on me when I heard it. \n\nI heard it. \n\nThe groaning sound of wood in the yard. By the time I’d flipped the covers over to venture out of bed and investigate I heard another sound, right below my window- the crunching of leaves, followed by a very soft high pitched yap. \n\nI rushed to the window and below it, under the bush, I saw a fox and her kits skulking up against the side of the house. The mother was coming down from a snarl, as though she had just snapped at one of them. I saw the kit in question, coming up to nuzzle the mother with its litter mates.\n\nI didn’t have time to ask myself what they were hiding from. \n\nA shape loomed in my periphery. From the shadowy outline of the garden shed’s roof I saw a shape emerge. Somewhat indiscernible, a head and a pair of shoulders- human looking, muscular, but very broad- like they’d been unnaturally pushed apart to make room for the tall spinous protrusions of its back. It approached the front most part of the roof turning to the side, and in the inky midnight blue sky its black silhouette engrained itself into my mind for eternity. From the massive torso and arched spine came a long thick neck that ran up to a skull, distinctly canine with a muzzle. The ears were pointed and translucent like the wings of a bat. I watched as one of its abnormally long arms moved dexterously to maneuver its body over the roof. Fear hit my blood stream, and I had to work to contain my scream of panic. My raspy whimper cracked out from my throat as I sprinted to my parents room where it turned into a cry. \n\n“Daaaaad! Mommmm!”\n\nIt was pure instinct, A child running and whimpering to its parents as the kit had beneath my window.\n\nThey groaned as they sat up in bed,\n\n“Amy? What is it baby? Are you okay?”\n\nI approached my mom’s side, cowering into my her arms. She held me tight by my wrists, trying to make out what I was saying despite being half asleep. \n\nA sudden wall within me fell, and defeat consumed me. \n\nThey wouldn’t believe me, but I know what I saw. \n\n*I know what I saw.*\n\n“Its the werewolf,” the last word came out in slow shaky whimper.\n\n“I swear. I swear Mama.” I gasped between sobs. \n\nShe released a deep breath, holding me close. \n\n“Amy,” I could hear the sorrow in her voice, but what stung was the disappointment.\n\n“Amy, you saw it out your window?” Dad was on his feet, already at the door to their bedroom.\n\n I nodded quickly.\n\nI heard him as he moved swiftly down the hall, presumably to go look out my window. He made footfall to the back door, grabbing a shell from the top of the bookshelf, loading it into his shot gun.\n\nOf course, he came back with nothing to report. \n\n“Amy, you must’ve had a nightmare baby.”\n\n“It was a werewolf! Im not making it up! It was on the garden barn, Daddy it was just there!”\n\n“I looked, baby, and I didn’t see it.”\n\n“Honey we know you’re not lying, you just had a vivid nightmare is all.”\n\nI shook my head and I wept. Not sure what was real anymore.\n\nMom and Dad let me crawl into bed with them.  \n\nThe next morning I heard them talking in hushed tones in the living room, over coffee. About me.\n\n“I was thinking if she saw something on two legs out there that maybe it was just a big man. I talked to Dan yesterday on the phone, he said some people in the area don't want to wait for the game warden- can’t say I entirely blame ‘em- but they might be out there trying to hunt the thing. I don’t know…”\n\n“I thought we had a good understanding yesterday. I should have done more to keep her grounded through all of this, paid more attention, I just-“ I heard my mom sigh, burying her face in her hands. My dad patted her back. \n\n“I hate that she is going through this. She’s such a good kid.”\n\n“No honey, none of this is your fault. I should’ve gotten more involved-”\n\n“No, no- you’ve been great. Not to mention, you’re working a 9 to 5 all week and then keeping the grounds up here… and burying dead animals as of late. Hopefully this is just a phase she’s going through. I just worry about her you know? The fairy stories, those so called “friends” of hers at school-“\n\nI couldn’t bear to hear any more. Mom and Dad had so much they were trying to juggle, and now I had caused them to worry about me. \n\nI hated myself for that, I hated that I had made them hurt. \n\nI tip toed back to their bedroom, crying under the covers for a little while until I had gotten my emotions under control. I wiped my tears and walked into the living room, making sure they saw me run the sleep from my eyes, an excuse for their redness. \n\nThe rest of the day I read mostly. Not wanting to really talk to anyone. I would’ve liked to have played with the cats, but there was no coaxing them from their refuge in the Kitty Cat Barn.\n\nI was mostly quiet at lunch and at dinner, finishing both quickly to “get back to the book I was reading.” Mom and Dad had each made at least one attempt during the day to say something to me about the night before. To make sure I was okay, to ask if I needed or wanted to talk about it. I knew that if we did they would only end up trying to help validate in my mind that it was all a dream. By the end of the day I wished that I was just being an imaginative child, and that I could honestly tell myself that it was just a vivid nightmare. \n\nMom and Dad offered to let me sleep with them that night. I thanked them, but refused, assuring them that I would be fine. I told myself that so long as I didn’t look out my window I wouldn’t risk seeing anything, and that gave me comfort. Enough comfort to sleep alone in a dark room with a werewolf possibly outside, anyway. \n\nTo my own surprise I managed to get to sleep well enough, tired from all the emotions I had been untangling for the past 24 hours.\n\nTo this day, I cannot say what compelled me to stir from my rest in the middle of the night. I awoke, rubbing my eyes as I got my bearings. \n\nI had told myself. \n\n*Don’t go over to the window. Nothing good ever happens when you go over to the window.*\n\nI don’t know if there was a part of me that wanted to prove myself wrong, so I could say to myself, \n\n*“See? There’s nothing out there. Maybe Mom and Dad are right, and you’re just a dumb little kid having nightmares.”*\n\nI padded over, hearing the friendly creak of the floorboards. I ducked under the lacey curtain veil that my mother had lovingly sewn together and hung up on my window, in all likelihood hoping it would keep me from doing exactly what I was about to do. \n\nTo my everlasting regret, I peered out into the pitch black world beyond the glass. \n\nThrough one of the vintage pane’s I saw something familiar.  A pair of chalky white new balance sneakers, something that I thought was unique to only one person.\n\nI felt my heart sink to the floor. \n\nThe bright white shoes stood out in the underbrush, and I squinted at the way they almost seemed to hover in the darkness. I managed to make out that the figure they belonged to was staggering into the woods. \n\n*What was wrong with Dad? Was he hurt?*\n\nI remember my mind beginning to free fall, panic setting in. My thoughts fogged up the window pane on a whisper, \n\n“If I wake Mom, I’ll just make her upset.”\n\nI should have just gotten Mom. God, I should have just gotten Mom. \n\nBut I had cried wolf too many times.\n\nMy plan was to go out the back door and call out to him from the stoop. I shuffled out into the night chill, hugging my arms to my chest. \n\nI had opened my mouth to shout his name, but before I could, I heard the agonizing cry from the figure out in the woods. I’d heard my Dad yelp when he brought a hammer down on his thumb, but I had never heard him cry out like that before. \n\nIt sounded excruciating.\n\n*Had the monster hurt him? Could he walk? Did he need help?*\n\nI watched the figure nearly crumpling over as it staggered into the pine rows.\n\nI- the sweet summer child- thought,\n\n*He isn’t far away.*\n\n*I could catch up to him quickly.*\n\n*I run that distance in P.E. all the time.*  \n\nBefore I knew it I was sprinting through the yard with confidence, I knew every rock, ant hill, and arching root. It was all mostly open space until you got to the concrete slab in front of the shop barn where Dad parked the Backhoe and Bear. My eyes slowly began to adjust to the dark. I ran on tiptoe across the icy cold concrete slab. I didn’t even have any shoes on. \n\nI stopped to take a better look at the barn. The lights weren’t on. Dad hadn’t been working on anything. What in the world was he doing out here so late? Did he see something?\n\nI peered into the pine rows. No sight of the figure. \n\nI wanted to call out to him, but hesitated. If that thing was out here I wasn’t going to draw its attention to us. \n\nHe couldn’t have been more than half a football field away. I could catch him.\n\nI ran through the frigid night air, my heart knocking like a piston within my chest. My gaze swung between the pine trunks as I scanned the rows. Seeing nothing, I continued to run. The monotony of the trunks and the rows and the waves of pine straw putting me into a trance. \n\nHow many rows back had I gone? Was this a football field- or half a football field?\n\n*Surely I would have seen Dad by now.*\n\nBy the grace of God I stopped, warm blood pumping through my chest, I tried to catch my breath as quietly as I could. The pines stood in formation around me, a sprawling arboreal army. \n\nIt felt like some dense mass had been dropped down my throat until it hit the bottom of my stomach, sinking like a stone. The nausea set in as I became cognizant of my situation, my instincts being translated into a flimsy string of cohesive thought. \n\n*Dear God. Dear God. I had ran too far.*\n\n*You idiot. You stupid dumb little child.*\n\nI became very still. \n\nSoft tender moonlight trickled through the pines, pearly beams scattering across the fallen pine needles.\n\nI looked out, down the corridors of trees. Making out a shape a few rows over, I squinted, shifting my head to see through the trunks. When I realized what I was seeing my eyes grew very wide, and my spine grew rigid. Terror hit me like lightning.\n\nIt was far enough away that I hadn’t seen it at first, but not so far that I couldn’t now see it in painful clarity. \n\nIt moved like a wraith in a crypt, a lean, creeping monstrosity. I remember thinking how fast it looked. How little time it would likely take it to get to me.\n\nI took slow silent steps backwards willing to do this all the way home if I had to. Now acutely aware of my surroundings, I stepped and felt a pang of hope. When I stepped there was no crunch in the pine needles.\n\nThinking this was to my advantage, I made a handful of quick steps until suddenly, to my corporeal horror, it stopped. I watched as its ears fanned upwards, unnaturally long and pointy. Its head turned on its long neck, the top of its muzzle moved up in a familiar motion. A sniff. \n\nIt could smell me.\n\nSlow and shaky steps turned quickly into a full sprint in the opposite direction, I nearly held my breath as I ran, trying to keep myself as quiet as possible. I bit my lips to keep from whimpering. I hoped I would be able to hear him if he started to run towards me.\n\nBut it dawned on me that what I had moments ago thought to be to my advantage was now to my great detriment- \n\n*When I stepped- there was no crunch.*\n\nI was suddenly also painfully aware of how bright neon pink my nightgown was in the darkness.\n\nMy jaw began to quiver as I pressed forward. I cut diagonally across the rows, moving in the general direction of the farmhouse. \n\nI ran like this, cutting across row after row after row until suddenly I collided with the ground, having tripped on a groove in the earth. In that moment I remember thinking that between keeping my tears at bay and fighting the urge to involuntarily wet myself, I knew something had to give. Urine it would smell, but hopefully not tears. That thought alone, and how hopelessly dead I began to realize I was caused them to fall like a downpour, cascading down my cheeks. Cold rivers on my warm flushed face. I scrambled up, again fighting the urge to whimper, until my blurry eyes caught sight of what I had tripped on. \n\nThe groove I had tripped on was one of many, claw marks that had slashed up layers of pine needles and ripped into the earth. Less than half a row away was a pile of clothes, among them were the treasonous pair of white new balance sneakers, cast aside haphazardly. \n\nI wish I could say that I told myself to calm down and think, but I didn’t. My hippocampus, my amygdala, one of them went AWOL and violently threw open the filing cabinet labeled “*Wolves*.”\n\n In all my follies that evening I made one decision that might have saved my life.\n\nI stripped off my neon pink nightgown, flinging it to the side. \n\nDown to nothing but my Barbie underwear, I yanked the shirt up from the ground, sliding it over my head.\n\nI grabbed the jacket, hurriedly slipping my arms into the sleeves.\n\nIt was huge on me, and smelled like cigarettes, but more importantly it wasn't bright pink and it would mask my smell. The smell of Mr. Bubble bath soap and warm milk. \n\nWith less than a couple of seconds to make a decision that I was willing to bet my life on, I frantically assumed that if the beast followed my scent diagonally through the pine rows that I would go diagonally the opposite way, but still in the direction of the house. \n\nHurtling forward I thought this would be a great plan until it occurred to me that it would see me. It would have one chance of seeing me from down the pine rows, I could only hope that I was far enough away. \n\nAdrenaline eventually took all my thoughts by the collar and kicked them out. Fate had dealt me a handful of seconds for thinking and I had used them up. My only task now was to act on them and pray.\n\nAs I ran I mustered up the courage to pivot and look beside me down the pine rows. Painfully aware that I was at the indefensible mercy of what I might see. \n\nAfter crossing over half a dozen rows I saw a flash. The most terrifying blur I had ever seen. I only vaguely made out its shape. Headed in the direction I had been in less than a minute before. There was no speculating about it. \n\nThe monster was after me. \n\nI could see light from the farmhouse, an angel reaching out in the night. Mom and Dad had realized that their baby girl wasn’t tucked in bed under her daisy quilt. My heart began to ache. I could practically smell the remnants of smoke from my dad’s pipe, feel the crisp linen sheets mom had just put on the bed. I choked back a sob. \n\nI continued to run until I emerged from the pine rows, right beside the shop barn. For a splintering second I thought of the naive child that  had stood there not 15 minutes ago, preparing to run into the devil’s hunting ground.\n\n I was so close, so close to the house. 100 yards at the most. I was ready to collapse in on myself, fall into hysterics in the safety of my parents arms. \n\nBut as I reached the shop barn I stopped. Dead in my tracks. A tug, a pull, a gut feeling. A memory from the night before. \n\nSurely, the shop barn was too tall.\n\nBut the oak tree beside it- beside me- wasn’t. \n\nMy head snapped up to my right. \n\nIt sat like a looming gargoyle on the burled apex of the oak’s twisted knotted branches, its enormous torso coiled up in the dark, ready to strike had I taken a few steps further.\n\nThe shadow of the barn had concealed me, but not for long. I watched as a cadaverous  front limb slid down the trunk from the dark and into the unholy moonlight. Massively elongated human palms and fingers, the bones bowing horrifically outwards like paws, tipped with keratinous claws that bit into the bark. I took a step backward. I watched in terror as the hand revealed an arm, muscled like a human’s but twice as long and curved at an unnatural angle. \n\nI darted into the barn. I knew I didn’t have more than a second or two. \n\nI stumbled in through the doorway. I was going to make a break for the upstairs loft, but I opted not to for fear of being cornered.\n\nMy eyes only had enough time for one vicious sweep of the room. They landed on a solid wooden workbench up against the wall with a trash can beneath it. I raced over, frantically crawling under it, unbothered by the cobwebs. Beside me was a bucket with various lengths of PVC pipe. With whatever borrowed time I didn’t have, I reached to move it to my side and block me in under the bench.\n\nI was unaware of the chains wound up in the bottom like snakes. \n\nI heard the grit from the bottom of the bucket scrape against the cement and I wanted to vomit.\n\nI peered out from my hiding spot, a tall ominous shape standing still in the doorway. \n\nFor all I knew, the scrape was inconsequential, perhaps it had already seen me and I was as good as dead anyway.\n\nMy cheeks were cold, but I felt the warm trails of tears still on my face.\n\nI watched as it entered the barn. It’s lean disfigured arms came into view first, the muscles slithering beneath the skin as it moved. Its torso was human but wide, stretched outwards unnaturally. The hips were the same way, narrow, but also having been stretched to achieve its new unholy function. It’s legs were much like the arms, and the feet much like the hands.\n\nIt stalked into the barn, sniffing the air. Once beside the bench it slowly began to crouch towards the ground. \n\nI was nearly blind with fear as it lowered itself.\n\nAs its head came into my line of sight I caught my breath in my throat. Below the bridge of the nose was oversized abnormal canine, as though its snout had erupted out of a human face. Its jaws and teeth were so large, and the skull had morphed to accommodate it. \n\nI could feel the heat radiate from the creature. Like it was on fire, burning and expending more energy than the vessel was meant to. I felt a wave of warmth wash over my legs but I was too petrified to register it.\n\nHowever abhorrently vile and evil its entire form was, it eyes were what shattered me.\n\nIt’s eyes are what I see every time I close my own, every night of my life.\n\nThey were hauntingly and devastatingly human. A man’s eyes. Green. Glassed over. The eyes nor the brows moved as it sniffed the air beside my hiding spot. They remained unfazed despite the snarl on its pale lips, or the twitch in its ears as it listened for me and instead heard something else. \n\nThe eyes were fixed in place, looking wherever the neck told it to. I watched as it slowly tilted its head at the sound, as if its interest had been gradually piqued. \n\nA few seconds later I heard the quick and heavy footsteps of my Dad approaching from outside the barn, followed by Bear roaring to life. The engine bellowed as he hit the gas. \n\nLike a shot, the beast moved out of the barn, seemingly in one silent spider like motion. Faster than wind. The sudden absence of its immense presence gutted me.  \n\nI don’t know when, but I realized that at some point my hand had slowly crept over my mouth in horror.\n\nI sat there for what felt like an hour. Sure that it was by the door. Waiting for me to come running out. \n\nI sat, every muscle in my body tensed until I heard a howl in distance. \n\nWhen you hear a wolf howl in a scary movie, it’s so weightless. Often times it means nothing, merely an overused sound bite to set the mood.\n\nWhat I heard caused whatever part of my psyche that was spiritual to tremble. \n\nIt was both an animalistic howl and a human scream. \n\nIt was anguish and rage and hunger. \n\nTears fell as I thought of my Dad. I came out here thinking I was helping him and I might’ve just gotten him killed. The dam was ready to burst, but I had to get home first. \n\nI delineated for a few moments. Unabashed horror holding me in a vice. I shook violently as I clumsily came out from under the bench. Feeling something wet I looked down. I had wet myself. I realized that I hadn’t gotten lucky. I had outsmarted nothing. The beast left because I was popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place. \n\n"

Even though the outside of the package arrived slightly punctured, the packaging was safely covered in foam paper and bubble wrap to protect everything so the box and bag were completely intact. To save some money on shipping i also asked for only the wallets packaging, this reduced volume weight and made shipping cheaper\n\nDISCLAIMER: l received a 50% shipping insurance refund for writing a review. But this will not affect my judgement.\n\nTimeline: 10/16-order placed, 10/19-received QC, 10/21-received tracking, 10/31- received package.\n\nThe ring is made from 925 silver with zircon. It’s finished cleanly with no rough edges or uneven polishing.\n\nThe bracelet is also 925 silver. I deliberately asked Hlin to pick a darker, more oxidised piece for me.\n\nThe wallet feels very premium. The 925 silver hardware is detailed and well engraved. Cowhide leather is soft but durable, and the jacquard lining adds a touch of luxury.\n\nAll of them have been tested for lead content, and all results were negative."

Finally ready to share and get honest feedback. 🙏\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* AI watches your vistor's sessions and writes short summaries, timestamps, flagging confusion, rage‑clicks, errors, dead ends - so you don’t scrub 1,000+ replays.\n* You can still watch every replay; the AI just bubbles up what deserves attention.\n* Chat with the AI about your whole dataset. It learns your site and gives suggestions (“why are users dropping on checkout?”).\n* Customize AI “personalities” (e.g., Growth PM, Support triager, QA) to tune what it looks for and how it categorizes sessions. (You can even write your own)\n* Bring your own Google Gemini API key if you want (no markup).\n* Add custom events you care about: clicked\\_checkout, form\\_abandoned, visited\\_pricing, signup\\_started, etc. Summaries use them for context.\n* Quick install (small script) and privacy‑friendly defaults.\n* You can have multiple projects in one account, if you manage more then one site.\n\nI’d love blunt feedback: Are the summaries helpful? Which default events would you want? Any onboarding rough edges?\n\nHere is a coupon for 60 days free for the starter plan: STARTUPS\\_PROMOTION\n\nTry it here: [https://revisit.pro](https://revisit.pro)\n\n\\- Martin  \n\n\n"

    "selftext": "Dear community members,In the context of the recent revelation of the K4 plaintext in September 2025 (thanks to the work of Jarett Kobek and Richard Byrne in the Smithsonian archives), I continue to analyze Jim Sanborn's clues. I believe that the phrase \"GO TO THE BERLIN CLOCK AND FACE EAST NORTHEAST\" from K4 may lead to a specific element in the CIA complex in Langley – the Memorial Garden. Below, I present the rationale for this hypothesis, based on spatial analysis and the sculpture's motifs. I invite discussion and critique – every observation is valuable.\n\n1. Spatial Analysis: NE Direction from KryptosThe coordinates from K2 (38°57'6.5\"N 77°8'44\"W) point to the Kryptos courtyard. The EAST NORTHEAST direction (approx. 67.5°) over about 150 feet leads directly to the Memorial Garden – the hillside memorial garden between the Original Headquarters Building (OHB) and the Auditorium (The Bubble). A shadow simulation (based on the sun's position on October 31, 2025) shows that the fieldstone outcroppings in the garden cast shadows forming a shape resembling \"BURIED\" – which corresponds to K2 (\"ITS BURIED OUT THERE SOMEWHERE\").\n\n2. Connection to \"Berlin Clock\"Hypothesis: \"BERLIN CLOCK\" may be a partial anagram or mask for \"BURIED IN CLOCK\" (letters B-E-R-L-I-N overlap with B-U-R-I-E-D I-N with minimal changes, such as swapping L for u/D). I interpret \"Clock\" as a sundial (sun clock) from the shadows of the stones in the garden – the structure of the outcroppings is similar to the petrified wood under Kryptos (both organic, quartz-silicate). The garden, designed in 1995 by Sheila Brady (OvS), commemorates deceased agents without physical graves, strengthening the metaphor of \"buried memory\" from K3 (Carter's quote about Tutankhamun's tomb).\n\n3. Broader Context: Pareidolia and SymbolismThe entire Langley complex exhibits pareidolia features resembling a human head (OHB as forehead, NHB as occiput, Bubble as eye), with Kryptos as the corpus callosum – the bridge between brain hemispheres. The \"gaze\" directed NE to the garden suggests it is the \"hippocampus of memory\" – the site of the final clue to K5 (teased by Sanborn). The RR Auction (lot 2001, ends November 20) may provide further clues.I found no similar analyses in available sources. Has anyone with experience in Langley noticed elements suggesting a sundial in the garden? What are your thoughts on the anagram or shadow simulation? Thank you for reading and feedback."

If you plan ahead and make the green choice, you can still move just as efficiently, but the greener way. Here’s how you can help still move efficiently while also helping the environment.\n\n# 1. Choose Shared Loads When You Can\n\nOur shared load service allows several clients to share truck space and split costs, but this isn’t only a cheaper way to move. It also reduces fuel emissions and our carbon footprint. By combining moves, we ensure there are less trucks on the road, reduced fuel emissions and a lower carbon footprint.\n\n# 2. Reuse and Recycle Packing Materials\n\nInvest in used cardboard boxes instead of buying new ones. You can source used boxes from local shops or friends, generally for free. Cardboard boxes can be recycled and reused several times before throwing them away. You can also use materials you already own like suitcases, containers or baskets.\n\n# 3. Wrap Smart, Not Wasteful\n\nOpt for using soft household items, like towels or linen, to wrap furniture instead of using plastic or bubble wrap. Cape Removals also provides protective blankets to reduce plastic waste.\n\n# 4. Declutter Before You Move\n\nTake the opportunity to declutter before your move. Sell, toss or donate items you no longer want or need. The less you move, the less you pay, but you may also be helping someone in need during this process! Decluttering also helps reduce wasted space in trucks.\n\n"

I feel things in a certain way, but I can’t really verbalize them. Theoretically, I don’t even know what I’m feeling. I just categorize everything as either “pain” or “tiredness.” I live in a bubble of unreflected reflection. I’m caught in the vicious cycle of cognitive dissonance. I live by the principle of intellectualizing every emotion just so I don’t have to actually feel it. (Also, intellectualization is a defense mechanism according to Freud in depth psychology.)

    "selftext": "Croakblade: The Frog Knight’s Feast\n\nChapter 1 – The Hunger Awakens\n\nThe swamp was quiet, save for the ripple of moonlight on black water.\nSir Croakblade opened one golden eye, his belly growling louder than the bullfrogs’ chorus. Dinner had eluded him again — flies too fast, snails too slimy, and beetles too bitter.\n\nHe adjusted the tiny sword strapped across his back — a needle he’d stolen from a sleeping seamstress long ago. Its handle was wrapped in cattail fluff, and to him, it was Excalibur.\n\n“I shall feast tonight,” Croakblade vowed to the stars, “or die trying.”\n\nFrom his lily pad throne, he leapt into the misty marsh, unaware that something darker than hunger stirred beneath the reeds — a shadow that whispered his name in bubbles.\n\n⸻\n\nChapter 2 – The Eel King’s Ambush\n\nCroakblade hopped through cattails and fog until the smell of fresh mosquitoes filled the air. His tongue flicked — snap! — dinner at last! But before the insect even hit his tongue, a surge of black water burst open.\n\nOut slithered the Eel King, a slick coil of muscle and malice wearing a crown of bonefish spines.\n“You dare hunt in my waters, little knight?” the eel hissed, lightning crackling in his scales.\n\nCroakblade bowed. “A knight must eat, Your Slipperiness.”\n\n“Then you’ll dine in the afterlife!”\n\nThe fight was fierce — sparks and splashes filled the night. Croakblade rolled, parried with his needle-sword, and struck the Eel King square on the chin. The eel recoiled, defeated, vanishing into the depths with a scream that rippled through the swamp.\n\nCroakblade, panting and soaked, speared a stray mosquito on his sword tip.\n“Appetizer,” he said, chewing proudly.\n\n⸻\n\nChapter 3 – The March Through the Murk\n\nBy dawn, the swamp had turned against him. Vines tangled his legs, crows laughed in the trees, and the fog whispered lies — “Turn back, Froggie Knight, your feast is a dream.”\n\nBut hunger drove him forward.\n\nHe crossed the Dead Log Bridge, where Toad Brigands demanded tolls of shiny stones.\nCroakblade paid with courage instead, leaping from brigand to brigand, disarming them with swift tongue-flicks and sword strikes. When the last toad surrendered, Croakblade took a lantern from their stash — a tiny glowworm trapped in glass — and pressed on into the blackest part of the swamp: The Hollow Reeds.\n\nThere, the darkness breathed. The air grew cold. And in the heart of it all, he saw movement — eyes like twin lanterns, too high above the ground to belong to any frog or toad.\n\n⸻\n\nChapter 4 – The Serpent in the Shadows\n\nThe creature that emerged was older than the swamp itself — The Night Serpent, whose coils were made of roots and whose breath smelled of rot and rain.\n\n“Why do you come, little green morsel?” it whispered, wrapping around him. “What feast could be worth your life?”\n\nCroakblade raised his glowing lantern. “Every knight deserves his supper — and I’ll carve my way through any beast that stands between me and it!”\n\nWith a croak of defiance, he plunged his sword into the serpent’s eye. The monster shrieked, writhing, crashing through trees and sending waves across the bog. Croakblade was thrown high into the air — and landed squarely on a fat, juicy dragonfly that had been hovering nearby.\n\nHe bit down before it could escape. “At last,” he said, chewing as the dawn’s first light broke through the mist.\n\nThe swamp was quiet again. The darkness receded. And there, on a battered lily pad, sat Sir Croakblade — full-bellied, muddy, and triumphant.\n\n“Victory,” he said, wiping his sword clean. “And dinner.”"

The biggest one was the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985: 21 years of oppression, kidnappings, corruption, police and military violence, torture, killings, racism — basically the full package of a society living under fear. It’s a very well-documented period in Brazil, but if anyone wants a sort of “intro,” last year’s Oscar-winning movie I’m Still Here does a great job showing what it was like.\n\nArgentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru — just off the top of my head — also had pretty brutal dictatorships, with notorious figures like Pinochet and Stroessner, who were basically on the same level of cruelty as Hitler and Mussolini.\n\nHere in Brazil, we almost had another coup under Bolsonaro’s government, but thanks to a bit of luck and a lot of courage from many people, the ones behind it — Bolsonaro included — are now facing prison, and democracy is still holding on (barely, but it’s alive).\n\nSo yeah, after everything we went through to finally live in a democracy, we Latinos can smell a dictatorship from miles away. And these ten months of Trump’s government? It’s got the nose, mouth, eyes, and ears of one.\n\nIf you strip away all the media noise and distractions — classic Steve Bannon playbook, by the way (the same one used a lot here in Brazil during Bolsonaro’s time) — it’s pretty clear that a fascist, oppressive regime is rising on American soil. Besides all the Project 2025 stuff, Trump’s already dropped hints about staying in power even without elections. Add to that the attempts to start new wars — in the Middle East and now even here in South America — the crazy things ICE has been doing (acting as judge and executioner for arrests of undocumented and legal residents), the open construction of detention camps, an economic crisis with a financial bubble ready to burst, growing income inequality, nuclear war threats… yeah, all signs that American democracy and freedom are on life support.\n\nSo, I’m honestly curious — how are you guys feeling about all this? What do you plan to do? What’s it like living through what might be your country’s first dictatorship?\n\n(Text is mine, only the translation and formatting were done by ChatGPT.

    "selftext": "Chapter1\n\nWe pulled up to the rickety old house, and despite the sea of melancholy that had engulfed me lately, I felt a twinge of excitement. The house was neither new nor luxurious, but it was more than I had anticipated.\n\nWe had moved from California, where we lived in a two-bedroom apartment in the worst part of town. Walking to work each day had become a constant nightmare. While I was thankful for the move, I couldn't help but expect the worst.\n\nI've been living with my mother and her husband for three years now, and saying I hate it is an understatement. I was raised by my amazing grandmother for most of my life until she passed away a few years ago. My mother, who insists I call her Lauren as if I'm some stranger she found on the street, was the only relative left to take me in.\n\nLauren and I have a non-existent relationship: she pretends I don't exist, and I stay out of her way. The real issue is her husband, Darren, who drinks far too much and becomes a complete asshole when he does. I keep my distance from him when he's been hitting the bottle too hard.\n\nWe moved to Georgia because Lauren got a job offer. Darren can hardly hold a job, so Lauren pays most of the bills. Typically, I work part-time and use my earnings to buy the necessities Lauren refuses to provide.\n\nThe new house was much bigger than I had expected, with chipped white paint and a crooked porch jutting out from the front. The only thing I looked forward to in this cross-country move was finally having my own bedroom. In California, my \"bedroom\" was the unused dining room blocked off by a curtain, as Darren insisted he needed the second bedroom as an office.\n\nI climbed out of the car, stretched, and slung my backpack over my shoulder as I walked to the front porch. I could hear Lauren and Darren already arguing, but I had learned to tune them out successfully. The front porch creaked under my feet, but I didn't mind. Darren only ever stepped outside to run to the liquor store, so I would have plenty of time to myself on the porch.\n\nLauren opened the front door, and I followed her inside behind Darren. Without wasting any time, I headed upstairs to my bedroom.\n\n\"The smallest room, Sophia. Don't forget it,\" Lauren reminded me, not that I could.\n\nI was instantly grateful to find a bathroom close to my bedroom. I smiled when I peeked into Lauren and Darren’s room and saw they had their own connected bathroom, which meant Darren would leave me alone for a change. He had a habit of pushing boundaries when he was drunk, but he was easy to escape when intoxicated.\n\nI walked into my bedroom and surveyed the peeling paint on the walls. Once I found a job, I could make this room more presentable. I had saved up a small fund since I was old enough to work. While I was a straight-A student, I needed a backup plan in case I didn't get a scholarship. Escaping this place the moment I turned eighteen was always on my mind.\n\nI dropped my backpack on the floor and looked around. The room was small but had a working door and four walls. A rickety queen-sized bed sat against the far wall, along with a dusty oak dresser. I ran downstairs and grabbed my large suitcase from the trunk of Lauren’s car, struggling under its weight. Lauren and Darren were still arguing, giving me plenty of time to wrestle my suitcase to the top of the stairs.\n\nEverything I needed fit comfortably in my suitcase. I didn't have many clothes, but I had grown used to that sad fact.\n\nI stuffed my clothes into the dusty dresser, pulling out an outfit for school tomorrow. Lauren had wasted no time enrolling me at the local public school, anything to get me out of the house and out of Darren’s thinning hair. I stuffed my debit card in my back pocket and ran downstairs. Lauren had her back turned, bickering at Darren as he set up the small TV in the living room.\n\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" Lauren snapped, turning to face me as I opened the front door. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. She never cared where I went before.\n\n\"I'm gonna find something for dinner,\" I shrugged. I had stopped eating dinners with Lauren and Darren long ago. Since the court made Lauren my legal guardian until I turned eighteen, I refused to give her any of the money I worked for, supporting myself to the best of my ability.\n\n\"Get me a six-pack while you're out,\" Darren snapped, his beady eyes narrowing at the TV. I gritted my teeth. \"I'm seventeen,\" I retorted, turning on my heel and walking out the front door, ignoring Darren’s mumbling.\n\nI stepped onto the main road, sighing. I had no idea where I was going. After a moment, I decided to go right, hoping to find a gas station for a bag of chips and a bottle of water.\n\nAfter walking for about fifteen minutes, I sighed with relief when a small corner store came into view. That was one thing I'd miss about California. There, you could walk in any direction and find a gas station or grocery store.\n\nInside the poorly lit corner store, I greeted the cashier, a girl not much older than me. I grabbed a bag of chips, a couple of bottles of water, and a granola bar, then walked to the register.\n\n\"Hi, do you know where Waltzlake High School is?\" I asked as I swiped my debit card. The girl, with jet-black hair streaked with green, nodded. \"Just follow this road until you reach the traffic light and turn left. You won't miss it.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I smiled, taking my receipt.\n\n\"New around here?\" she asked, smirking.\n\n\"That obvious?\" I chuckled.\n\nThe girl nodded. \"Town's pretty small. Most people live further out in the woods.\"\n\n\"Why not just live in town?\" I asked, furrowing my brows.\n\n\"People around here like their privacy,\" she shrugged.\n\nI left the corner store feeling confused and wary. Her words didn’t give me much hope for school tomorrow. If this town was as small as she implied, I wouldn't go unnoticed. With only one more year left of high school, my goal was to escape Lauren and Darren the moment I turned eighteen.\n\nI woke up to the sound of my old alarm clock. It was six in the morning, leaving me plenty of time to get ready and walk to school. Lauren would already be at work, and Darren typically slept in until 11 a.m. or later. I crept out of my bedroom and into the bathroom, making as little noise as possible. Darren was an absolute nightmare if you woke him up.\n\nI combed my long chocolate brown hair, noting how different it was from Lauren family's light blonde hair. My heterochromia made me stand out even more, with one eye an incredibly light blue and the other a deep chocolate brown. My grandma rarely spoke of my father, but when she did, she mentioned he had the same condition. I suspected this was why Lauren, my own mother, didn't like me. Something bad had happened between her and my father, resulting in him leaving us.\n\nEvery month, Grandma received a mysterious check written out for me, but since moving in with Lauren, she used them for herself and Darren. I looked in the mirror and frowned, feeling like a walking abnormality. At my old school, I had friends, but there were always bullies who mocked my condition. It took a long time to accept and find beauty in my uniqueness.\n\nI slipped on a simple outfit—skinny jeans, a white tank top, and a black jacket—to blend in. Grabbing a granola bar, I left the house and walked to school, following the girl's instructions. By the time I arrived, the parking lot was nearly full. Students hopped out of their cars, heading to the front doors, conversations filling the air.\n\nI merged into the crowd, trying to blend in, and made my first stop at the office, easily identifiable by a large sign hanging from the ceiling. A plump woman in a purple sweater greeted me with a smile. \"Are you new here?\"\n\nI nodded and gave her a small smile. \"Sophia Drake.\"\n\n\"Beautiful name,\" she said, rifling through papers. \"Here you are, Ms. Sophia.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I replied, taking the papers and turning to leave. As I looked down at my class schedule, I slammed into someone.\n\nIt felt like hitting a brick wall, but the strong smell of cologne indicated otherwise. I landed on the floor with a thud, and the hallway quickly quieted. Looking up, I saw two very large, very angry twins. They looked like they belonged on a magazine cover rather than at a high school.\n\nChapter2\n\nThe twins had jet-black hair, strong jawlines, and extremely dark eyes. Both were muscular with an athletic build. One had his hair shaved on the sides and back, but long on top, while the other had messy hair down to the top of his ears. Each was drop-dead gorgeous in his own way. A tall blonde clung to one twin's arm, sneering at me.\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with her eyes?\" the blonde sneered, looking down on me like I was trash.\n\nI barely glanced at her, my eyes flickering between the twins. They glanced at each other, seeming to have a silent conversation.\n\n\"It's a condition,\" I replied without warning, stifling the urge to roll my eyes.\n\n\"Fucking freak,\" the blonde spat. \"Watch where you're going next time.\"\n\nWith those words, the twins and the blonde walked away. The twins hadn't said a word to me, and I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. Their cold eyes gave me the sinking feeling they might be my new bullies. Staying to myself was already proving to be a nightmare.\n\nI picked myself up and found my locker, scanning the hallways for any sign of the twins. Some part of me wanted to see them again. After sternly reminding myself to blend in, I headed to my first class, grateful it didn't include the twins or the mean blonde girl. The teacher pointed me to a seat in the back next to a girl with large glasses and curly red hair.\n\nShe gave me a small smile. \"I'm Kat.\"\n\n\"I'm Sophia,\" I replied, returning her smile.\n\n\"Awesome name,\" Kat nodded as she doodled on a piece of paper.\n\n\"My father picked it out,\" I shrugged.\n\n\"My dad wanted to name me Brady,\" Kat said with a horrified look, making me giggle.\n\n\"Your eyes look awesome, by the way,\" she complimented.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I smiled. Compliments on my eye condition were rare.\n\n\"My childhood friend had the same thing, but only in one eye,\" Kat grinned.\n\nI spent most of the class talking to Kat and subtly asking about the twins. \"Oh, the twins,\" Kat blushed, scowling at her paper. \"Kieran and Ethan.\"\n\n\"Which one is which?\" I asked, their names fitting their bad-boy personas perfectly.\n\n\"I always get them mixed up, but I'm pretty sure the longer-haired one is Ethan and the other is Kieran.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" I nodded. Despite my resolve, I couldn't get the twins out of my head. Their cold stares made me feel strange, yet I continued thinking about them.\n\n\"I wouldn't mess with them if I were you,\" Kat warned. \"They sleep around, a lot.\"\n\n\"Wasn't planning on it,\" I shook my head, promising myself not to get involved with them. They seemed into glamorous, model-type girls, the complete opposite of me. I stuck to myself and was often clumsy.\n\nKat and I made plans for the weekend while making small talk. She worked at a local restaurant and even offered to get me a job as a waitress.\n\nKat told me she'd give me a ride after school tomorrow for an interview at the restaurant. \"It's not fancy or anything, but it's the fanciest we have in this town,\" she shrugged. \"You get decent tips if you know how to be flirty.\"\n\nI chuckled nervously. \"I have no idea how to be flirty.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll learn. It comes with the job,\" Kat reassured me.\n\nI was definitely worried about working as a waitress. My clumsiness seemed to increase with my nervousness, and the last thing anyone wanted was a waitress spilling drinks all over them.\n\nMy day seemed to be turning around when I walked into my next class and saw Kat sitting in the back. We continued our conversation.\n\n\"The people here really aren't all bad,\" Kat smiled. \"You'll survive as long as you avoid Jessy and her friends.\"\n\n\"Jessy?\" I asked, frowning.\n\n\"The blonde girl who hangs around the twins,\" Tori replied, helping me put a name to the face. Jessy was the supermodel-like girl who called me a freak. Great start.\n\n\"I think I already blew that one,\" I frowned.\n\n\"Just completely avoid the twins from now on,\" Kat advised. \"She's with Kieran at the moment and she's super possessive.\"\n\nI was more than happy to take Kat’s advice, but my luck ran out in my next class, which had both twins. They sat alone at a large square table, and my heart nearly fell out of my chest when the teacher told me to join them. Walking to the back, I tripped over someone's table leg but managed to catch myself, ignoring the snickers from other students.\n\nWith my face burning and my stomach doing flips, I sank down at the twins' table, avoiding eye contact until I could calm my thundering heart. I could feel their eyes on me, and I let out a shaky sigh before turning to meet their gaze. Sitting this close to them was both a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing because I had a much better look at them—Kieran was slightly more muscular, but their faces were nearly identical with full eyebrows, long eyelashes, and plump lips.\n\n\"Oh look, Kieran,\" Ethan smirked, his voice tinged with amusement. \"It's the little girl with the strange eyes.\"\n\nEthan's voice was deep and rough around the edges, causing my voice to catch in my throat. Kieran's lips turned up in a smirk as his cold eyes roamed over me. \"This is the girl Jessy was talking about?\"\n\n\"She's the one who didn't watch where she was going,\" Ethan smirked at his brother.\n\nThey were talking about me as if I weren't there, and I sat silently, trying not to gape at them. Their attractiveness was undeniable, but their attitudes were infuriating. I regretted my instant attraction to the twins.\n\n\"I hadn't noticed,\" Kieran sneered, and I held back the urge to flinch. Despite Darren's frequent drunken berating, the twins' words bothered me more.\n\n\"Oh look, Kieran,\" Ethan smirked again. \"The little doll is trying to ignore us.\"\n\nMy heart jumped at the nickname, unsure if it was an insult or a compliment. The way they looked at me scared and enticed me simultaneously.\n\n\"Ignoring us will only make it worse for you, sweetheart,\" Kieran said, his dark eyes burning into mine.\n\nMy heart continued to race at the names they called me. This was a game I didn't understand—borderline bullying, yet the names sounded affectionate. I scolded myself for thinking they might like me. Why would two god-like twins be interested in someone like me?\n\nIgnoring them only made it worse. Throughout the class, they continued to make comments, pushing my buttons. I wasn't sure if they wanted a response or an outburst, but I gave them neither. They made me do all the work for a week-long project by myself.\n\nThe next class was no better, featuring Ethan, Kat, Jessy, and her friends. Sitting by Kat the entire time was a small comfort, but Ethan continued to smirk and pester me. Jessy's hatred for me was clear, and the more attention Ethan gave me, the angrier she got.\n\nSomehow, I managed to get through the rest of the school day, which consisted of five extremely long classes. Unfortunately, I had both twins in two of them. Gym class, always my least favorite, was even worse with the twins' hot gazes making my uncoordination more pronounced. Luckily, I could sit out until they found me a uniform, but knowing I would start gym on Monday tied my stomach in knots.\n\nA week passed in a blur. Darren was as bad as ever, but I avoided confrontations and his handsy behavior. The twins continued to torment me, both upsetting and confusing me. Jessy and her friends escalated from glares and snickers to mean comments.\n\nOn the bright side, Kat and I became closer once I got hired at the same restaurant where she worked, a little Italian place in town. I also made a new friend, Lilian, an athletic girl with sandy blonde hair and large blue eyes.\n\nMy first weekend in Georgia began, mostly filled with work. I needed to make up for the money I spent on school supplies and food. Despite everything, I wasn't sure if things were looking up or simply settling down.\n\nChapter3\n\n\"And you're sure you don't mind?\" I asked, my voice tinged with embarrassment as I glanced at Kat.\n\nKat scoffed, rolling her eyes. \"Of course not. We work the same shifts anyway. I’ll just have to come in thirty minutes early,\" she said with a shrug.\n\nWhen Kat found out I planned to walk half an hour to and from work, she insisted on giving me a ride every day. I wasn't used to people offering help, so her gesture made me feel a bit guilty.\n\n\"Let me at least give you gas money every week,\" I said, fidgeting with the tight uniform we had to wear.\n\nIt was my first day of work, a Sunday, and while Saturday was spent finishing the project Ethan and Kieran refused to do, today was slow. Fortunately, the people in this town tipped well, and I only managed to spill things on myself rather than on anyone else. Our uniform was a black t-shirt with the restaurant's logo and tight black slacks, which hid most of my clumsy spills.\n\nKat and I stepped back inside the restaurant after our thirty-minute break. As I peeked out from the kitchen doors, I noticed more people coming in. It was around 5p.m., and my shift ended in two hours. I was counting the minutes until I could collapse into bed.\n\nMy heart sank when Kieran and Ethan walked in with Jessy and another beautiful girl. A sharp pain radiated through me at the sight of them with the two girls, but I shoved it down. Now wasn't the time for my conflicting feelings. They were seated in my section, and I audibly groaned.\n\nKieran and Ethan looked even more attractive outside of school. Kieran wore a black sweater rolled up to his elbows, dark jeans, and black boots. Ethan wore almost the same thing, but with a leather jacket. I caught myself gawking and quickly stopped. The last thing I needed was to fall into their game.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Kat asked, peeking out the door.\n\n\"Kieran and Ethan, of course,\" I sighed.\n\n\"I don't know what you did to get on their radar, but I feel for you,\" Kat said, shaking her head with a sad chuckle.\n\n\"I didn't do anything. I ran into them once by mistake, and they decided to make my life hell,\" I grimaced.\n\n\"I'd tell you to go to the principal, but they seem to have everyone wrapped around their fingers,\" Kat frowned.\n\nI sighed, deciding not to complain further. They wanted a reaction, and I refused to give them one. All I needed was to hold out until I turned eighteen next February and could leave this town.\n\n\"Do you want me to wait on them?\" Kat asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"No, they'll never let me live it down.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and approached their table with a fake smile, focusing on the girls. Jessy sat next to Kieran, while Ethan had a beautiful raven-haired girl by his side.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Sophia, and I'll be your server today,\" I said, ignoring Jessy's sneer. \"Can I get you anything to drink this evening?\"\n\n\"Sophia. What kind of name is that?\" the raven-haired girl snickered, causing Jessy to laugh.\n\nI kept my smile in place. \"I'll take water,\" Jessy sighed. \"But I'll need something stronger if I have to look at your freaky eyes for too long.\"\n\nHaving one brown eye and one blue eye made it difficult to find a color that suited me perfectly, but I couldn't fathom what was so 'freaky' about it.\n\nI glanced at Kieran and Ethan, who smirked. They ordered sodas while the girls ordered water. I practically ran from the table to get their drinks.\n\nIn the kitchen, Kat and Tyler stopped me. \"How's it going with the twins?\" Kat asked, frowning.\n\n\"Always pleasant,\" I replied sarcastically.\n\n\"Who's always pleasant?\" Tyler asked, draping an arm over my shoulder. I stiffened, uncomfortable with his lack of personal space.\n\nKat huffed, \"Why do you have to put your grubby hands all over everyone?\"\n\nTyler smirked, tightening his arm around me. \"Jealousy doesn't suit you, Kat.\"\n\n\"Vermin,\" Kat muttered, shaking her head.\n\nJessy really had it out for me, and I grabbed their drinks, trying to steady my breath as I approached their table. I nearly cheered when I made it without spilling anything.\n\nAs I set Kieran's drink down, his hand flicked forward, spilling it. His smirk made my blood boil. \"I apologize for that. I'll clean it right up and get you another,\" I said politely, mopping up the soda.\n\n\"Don't be shy, sweetheart. You made the mess,\" Kieran smirked.\n\nI leaned across the table, my heart pounding, as I cleaned up. Kieran's cologne was intoxicating, earthy with a hint of sweetness.\n\n\"Why do you smell like cologne?\" Kieran demanded, his eyes flicking to Ethan.\n\n\"I don't see why that matters,\" I murmured, rushing back to the kitchen for a replacement drink.\n\n\"You alright, Sophia?\" Tyler asked.\n\n\"Yeah, Tyler. I'm fine,\" I huffed, grabbing another drink.\n\nPlacing the new drink in front of Kieran, I forced a smile. \"Is everyone ready to order?\"\n\nKieran and Ethan looked pissed, and Jessy's nasal laugh echoed from across the dining room. They directed insults my way, but I grinned through it all.\n\nFinally, they got up to leave, and I grabbed the check, retreating to clock out for the day. My eyes widened as I looked at the check. Their bill was almost $70, and they left me a $60 tip. The note at the bottom of the receipt sent butterflies and nausea rushing through me:\n\n\"See you soon, doll.\n\nE&K\"\n\nChapter4\n\nI clocked out of work after making a decent amount from tips alone. It would definitely help replenish what I had spent on clothes and necessities. While I was happy to be free from work, going home was another situation entirely.\n\nWhen Kat dropped me off, Lauren was still at work for another hour. That left me alone with Darren. The moment I walked through the front door, I knew he was completely drunk. He sat in the recliner, watching a fuzzy football match on TV, his face contorted in anger.\n\n\"Where the fuck have you been?\" he spat, struggling to lift himself off the recliner.\n\n\"Working, Darren,\" I repeated for the hundredth time, trying not to roll my eyes, knowing it would only anger him more. I turned to head upstairs, hoping to escape his drunken tirade, but something he said made me stop.\n\n\"Working?\" he scoffed, wobbling as he stood. \"You were out whoring around like your fucking mother.\"\n\nThis time, I did roll my eyes. If he wasn't drunk all the time, he'd remember that Lauren made me pay for everything myself. I didn't have time to \"whore around\" when I was busy supporting myself and going to high school.\n\n\"Lauren isn't my mother,\" I snapped, turning to walk up the stairs. His hand wrapped around my wrist and yanked me back. I didn't fall, but I stumbled a few steps.\n\n\"Get off me, Darren,\" I mumbled, my body tensing in fear. The few times he had gotten this close weren't pretty. Darren was always handsy when he was drunk, whether it be abusive or sexual.\n\n\"Fucking whore,\" he spat, his alcohol-tinged breath invading my nose. He yanked me closer, and I nearly gagged at the sight of his sweat-stained shirt. My entire body felt cold with fear. He was much too close for comfort.\n\nI grimaced at the disgusting smell of stale beer and body odor. His grip tightened around my wrist, and I gritted my teeth against the pain.\n\n\"I said get off!\" I screeched, bringing my knee up between his legs. Darren let out a hiss of pain, releasing my wrist. I could hear his drunken yelling as I ran to my bedroom and slammed the door behind me. I fumbled with the lock through the tears that had sprung up in my eyes.\n\nOnce the door was locked, I flopped down on my bed and let a few tears trail down my face. Some days were harder than others, but it would all be worth it when I left this place. Over the years, I had lost hope that Lauren would treat me like her own daughter and instead looked forward to escaping the moment I turned 18.\n\nI stayed on the bed for hours, not daring to move until I heard the front door open and Lauren come inside. Only then did I pull myself off the bed and trudge into the shower. The steaming water hid my tears as they fell freely.\n\nLiving with Darren required constant vigilance, always being on guard around him. It was exhausting and left me in a perpetual state of paranoia. I hopped out of the shower feeling completely drained and fell into bed.\n\nMorning came much too quickly. After a few hours of restless sleep, I woke up and changed for school. I put on one of the outfits I had recently bought—a pair of skinny jeans and an off-shoulder long-sleeve shirt. I grimaced at the handprint bruise on my skin and yanked my sleeve down over it.\n\nAs usual, my first and second classes of the day were with Kat. We chatted while working on our assignments. My next class, however, was the one I worried about. Kieran's comment about cologne at the restaurant had me confused, but I let it slip from my mind shortly after. Apparently, the twins had not.\n\nKieran and Ethan both looked irresistible, their hair tousled in that perfect, messy way. Kieran wore a dark blue button-down shirt, while Ethan sported a simple black t-shirt. They sat at our usual table, only this time Ethan was across from Kieran. I grimaced, realizing I'd have to sit next to one of them. Kieran seemed more serious and sometimes scarier, so I plopped down beside Ethan.\n\nEthan smirked at Kieran, as if he had won a bet. I averted my eyes from the sinfully attractive twins and pretended to be interested in the teacher.\n\n\"Did the little doll finish our group project?\" Ethan teased, his hot breath curling around my ear. A shudder wracked through my body, and Ethan snickered. I clamped my lips shut and ignored him. Of course, I finished the project. I couldn't let the troublesome twins ruin my grade.\n\nWhen I didn't answer, Ethan's fingers danced over my shoulder and tickled my collarbone. I sucked in a sharp breath at the tingles that bubbled against my skin under his touch.\n\n\"Stop,\" I hissed, keeping my gaze on the teacher.\n\nI could hear a weird rumbling sound coming from Ethan, and the urge to look became overwhelming. My eyes flickered over to him, noticing a strange glint in his dark orbs.\n\nI couldn't understand these insanely gorgeous twins. First, they chose me to pick on. Second, they wanted a reaction from me. Third, when they finally got a reaction, they seemed pissed.\n\n\"Why don't you make me stop, doll?\" Ethan grinned, his thick fingers running along my exposed collarbone.\n\nJust then, the teacher walked around, collecting the group projects. Ethan's wandering hand retreated, and I rifled through my binder to find our project. After handing it to the teacher, I nearly jumped from my seat as a large hand grasped my thigh.\n\nEthan smirked down at me, and I felt my body stiffen. \"Where's that feisty little attitude, doll?\" he whispered, his voice gruff and too close to my ear.\n\nI bit my cheek, determined not to feed into their nonsense. Whether they got off on acting this way or not, I wasn't planning on encouraging it.\n\nAnd that's how I spent the rest of the class—sucking in sharp breaths as Ethan's hand traveled where it shouldn't. At one point, he tugged playfully on a strand of my hair. I turned my head to hide the aggressive blush on my cheeks.\n\nI quickly noticed that Kieran was the quiet one. His eyes were glued to me the entire class. When he wasn't staring at me, he was glaring at his brother. I swore I could see jealousy burning in his eyes. It was a shame they wanted to take turns tormenting me.\n\nChapter5\n\nMy next class included Ethan, Kat, and Jessy. It was a love-hate situation. Sitting next to Kat kept Ethan from tormenting me, but Jessy and her friends constantly threw insults my way. For someone who acted invincible, her words hurt a lot.\n\nI had been dreading gym class all day. We were split between volleyball and basketball for the next month or so. Sports were always challenging for me, and as funny as it sounds, the ball always seemed attracted to my face. I chose volleyball since Ethan and Kieran weren't in that group, but to my dismay, Jessy was.\n\nMy options weren't great: basketball with the intrusive twins or volleyball with mean comments from Jessy. I'd choose mean comments any day. While the medium-sized gym shirt fit me comfortably, they only had a size small in the shorts. Though I was naturally slim, my hips flared out along with a full bottom, making the shorts ride up my thighs. They looked like they were going to tear at any moment, though the weird mesh material gym shorts were made from was typically strong.\n\nI somehow managed to survive fifteen minutes of dodging the volleyball when something had to happen. Jessy served the ball, and someone on the other team hit it back. The ball was heading straight for my face, and I braced myself for impact. Instead of getting hit, I was abruptly knocked to the ground. My head bounced against the linoleum floor with a sickening crack. A dazed whimper escaped my lips as my teeth clicked together.\n\n\"Shit, Sophia. You okay?\" Lilian's familiar voice spoke from above me. She offered her hand, and I gratefully took it as she pulled me to my feet. The world wobbled a little, and I knew I'd have a killer headache tomorrow, but I'd survive.\n\n\"What the hell happened?\" I groaned, feeling the side of my head for any traces of blood. I turned to Lilian's gaze and saw the smug eyes of Jessy, snickering with another girl. She gave me a taunting wave when she caught me looking.\n\n\"Jessy happened,\" I gritted my teeth, answering my own question. I noticed the rest of the class had stopped playing basketball to gawk at what had just happened. My eyes scanned the other kids until they landed on Ethan and Kieran. My heart nearly dropped at their sweaty physiques and tousled hair. What made my blood run cold were the murderous glares they were throwing in my direction.\n\n\"Lilian, take Sophia to the nurse,\" the gym teacher snapped. \"Everyone else, get back to playing!\" A couple of whistle blows later, it was as if nothing had happened. Lilian walked me to the nurse's office, where we both sat waiting.\n\n\"I'll be back in a jiffy, honey. Some poor kid threw up in science class,\" the nurse shuddered and zipped from the room.\n\n\"At least you're not the only one having a bad day?\" Lilian giggled.\n\n\"Fair point,\" I chuckled dryly, my head beginning to throb. \"At least everyone saw her knock me to the ground.\"\n\n\"It's not like anything will happen to her,\" Lilian grimaced.\n\n\"Why not? Everyone saw her knock me down. Since when is that okay?\"\n\n\"Since she's Jessy, favorite toy to Kieran,\" Lilian laughed humorlessly.\n\nI shook my head. \"What the hell is up with these people? How can they not get in trouble?\"\n\n\"Their parents basically own the town,\" Lilian shrugged. \"No one wants to get on their bad side, especially the twins.\"\n\n\"That needs to change,\" I muttered. \"You don't have to sit here with me, you know.\"\n\n\"Any excuse to miss gym is fine with me,\" Lilian chuckled. \"How's your head feeling?\"\n\n\"Like I need a new one,\" I said, hoping the nurse would give me some Advil.\n\n\"Oh, that reminds me. There's a party this Saturday, and I want you to come with me. I'll invite Kat too after school,\" Lilian grinned.\n\n\"How did that remind you of a party?\" I shook my head.\n\n\"No clue, but are you interested?\"\n\n"

    "selftext": "Day one was nothing but confidence, day two… challenges.\n\nGot a hold of a bit of 400# and some advice from a buddy for a cup of coffee and a joint, then headed out to the crisp, surprisingly dry autumn air to keep the momentum rolling. A gentle breeze was rolling through and I started spraying. Turns out, that gentle breeze caused some of the paint to create little bubbles of paint, almost like stucco. No biggie, sandpaper handled that after it dried. But I noticed a small section that looked like it was developing scales, and when I would sand it, they seemed more resilient than the paint and became more pronounced with work. A few coats later. They’re gone.\n\nNow, finally at a point where my can was running out, I felt confident that we were getting close to being ready to call painting done… but as I moved it, and was very almost out of paint, I accidentally hit the top of the neck pocket, which is pictured. Not the biggest issue, but it sets me back a day or two before I can get a chance to snag another can.\n\nWhat I learned, a gentle breeze is not gentle if you are a tiny little orb of paint and don’t count your chickens. Paint is finicky and will trick you into thinking you’re good at it, but even if you’re not, it’s ok, it turns out that these chunks of wood and screws are kinda tough and spray paint, nor sandpaper seem to be enough to destroy your guitar body unless you’re incredibly creative!\n\nToday and tomorrow are probably going to be minimally productive on doing things to the actual guitar, but I know that I’ve been extremely lucky this fall in being able to get outside to actually spray stuff. I live in a RAINY part of the world, so I started to think ahead and I happen to have a few building/painting supplies from moving into my house and have an out of the way side door that never gets used. I started using some of the skills I got from guerrilla indoor gardening back in the day to construct a little spray booth that I can use for a couple weeks while I’m dealing with clear. I feel like Dexter right now, with my little plastic room, lmfaoo!\n\nThanks again for all the encouragement and inspiration, it’s really incredible seeing this thing come together!\n\nTo experienced painters: \n\nI wish I had a picture of the scales I was experiencing, it almost looked like warts. It was only in a small area, maybe the size of a nickel and the spots were maybe the size of a ball end of a guitar string, pretty oval shaped and relatively uniform. What was it?\n\nGoing into clear. Should I wet sand and clean the surface before I begin clear coating? I understand that the clear coat will not need to be sanded between layers but will need to be finished with a fine sand and some buffing. If I wet sand it, what would you suggest cleaning the surface with, alcohol?\n\n"

    "selftext": "Alright I cant fuckin tell if it's just a meme anymore. Look he's quite entertaining as a character, but we agree that morally he's rather questionable, RIGHT?\n\nHe beats up megumi mercilessly, because.....he doesn't have an intriguing fetish??? Bro??? Needs to be forcibly stopped by Inumaki.\n\nHes completely nonchalant when he suspects that he may have killed Yuji (and before you ask \"what about the other kyoto students, they were actively ganging on him\", well all the others either were scared of defying orders, or are given their due criticism. Todo is rather powerful and clearly lacks concern for punishment from the higher ups, so he's just being violent for fun)\n\nNow I know I'm saying this despite mei mei existing, but she gets shit on enough, and she definitely isn't universally REVERED. Yes in the Jjk world, you can't be too picky with allies, and you can enjoy a character without condoning their actions, but people dont fail to understand and acknowledge that Sukunas a POS just cuz he's an exciting character. Meanwhile Todo is always the SUPREME GOAT, never seen him criticised (now I'm sure SOMEONE loathes him, I'm aware of the fallacy of considering personal anecdotes to be universally applicable, but i dive into this fandom A LOT, so it's still significant I think).\n\nIt's not even just reddit memes, youtube comments too, FRIENDS IRL. \n\nI know that in battle mangas/animes, people get sorta desensitized to violence - and see it as just another way to communicate - albeit a peculiar one. Rivals will often beat each other up, even over relatively minor disagreements, to express themselves. But Todo's fights with his peers are definitely not under this category.\n\nEven slice of life animes/mangas have \"funny\" moments of characters beating each other up or borderline murdering each other, but that has an obvious hyperbolic quality that alludes to the fact it isn't meant to be taken at face value (communicated via art style shift, voice acting as well as choppy but erratic character expressions), so it's a bit different even if debatably problematic.Todo's interactions are OBVIOUSLY not under this category.\n\nEven fucking lobotomy kaisen refuses to slander this man, seeing him as too GOATed for it. WHY?\n\nI ask my friend irl, and they just say \"Lol. Lmao even. Get that autism diagnosis ffs\".\n\nAM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE????? IS IT JUST A JOKE?????? AM I CAUGHT IN A BUBBLE??????"

    "selftext": "* *This article is based on ideas from Volcanism by Hans-Ulrich Schmincke (pp. 5–6).*\n\nVolcanoes not only exist and erupt to provide jobs for volcanologists; they are the most visible proof that planet Earth is alive and dynamic. Although this statement may sound trivial to a scientist, it carries deep meaning. The natural fascination people have for volcanoes and eruptions is rooted in the fact that we live on a planet whose interior is extremely hot and continuously active. Earth constantly transfers material from its interior to the surface and to the atmosphere, which was initially formed by the degassing of the planet itself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9xi7ugy8gyf1.jpg?width=3866&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75768bce5a2fa55b4fb9ff1c9be9a7caf8929214\n\nOur present understanding of how volcanoes work naturally depends on continuous advances in studying processes occurring deep within the Earth. Any attempt to understand the causes and consequences of volcanic eruptions must therefore consider the entire volcano–magma system, which includes both the deep rooted magma sources beneath a volcano and the atmospheric interactions above it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktvok4a19gyf1.jpg?width=520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8b6bf911a50e95226e587e112a6a93c33e975c9\n\n* ***The Volcano - Magma System***\n\nThe volcano–magma system can be simplified into four depth zones. In the root zones, magma forms through partial melting of pre-existing rocks. These parent rocks vary widely in both geological history and chemical composition. Differences in source rocks and magma formation mechanisms are best interpreted within their global tectonic framework. The composition of magmas, the xenoliths brought up from depth, and remote seismic observations are all essential for understanding the nature and processes of these root zones. Recognizing these processes helps explain why a volcano forms at a particular place and time, with a specific magma type and eruptive behavior whether quiet, effusive, or highly explosive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8prads969gyf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91ade7859eda4922f5b71d0d7667d995e065328a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6ajmpt89gyf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cd14ffd4f73a899ccd5e86ef2dd5f436f846c00\n\nAs seen in the images above, one lava flow has higher viscosity and therefore advances slowly and as a massive, blocky body, while the other has lower viscosity and spreads more fluidly, following the general contours of the topography. Understanding such differences in lava behavior is crucial, since viscosity controls the eruption style, flow morphology, and associated volcanic hazards.\n\nWhether a magma erupts effusively as a lava flow or dome extrusion, or explosively as an ash plume, depends on parameters such as composition, viscosity, ascent rate, interaction with external water, and the formation and bursting of bubbles as the magma becomes saturated with volatiles. All active volcanoes release gases sometimes tens of thousands of tons daily without necessarily erupting explosively. Degassing can occur kilometers below the surface, where bubbly magma releases its volatiles without fragmentation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olltzytg9gyf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f807687caf5127f1aa5385a57ee358779b7be92\n\nIn summary, volcanoes serve as dynamic windows into Earth’s interior. By studying their magma systems, eruption styles, and degassing processes, scientists can better understand not only volcanic hazards but also the mechanisms that shape our planet’s surface and atmosphere. Each eruption, whether gentle or violent, represents the continuous exchange of energy and material between the Earth’s deep interior and its outer layers reminding us that our planet remains geologically alive and ever evolving.\n\nThank you for reading <3"

    "selftext": "Global markets have weathered trade tensions, but a new anxiety is creeping in – the [risk of an AI bubble](https://beinsure.com/ai-bubble-concerns-intensify/). Investors see tech valuations climbing so high that earnings might never meet expectations, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n\nWith equity indexes increasingly dominated by a small cluster of mega-cap tech names, even a modest correction could spill into something large enough to shift economic trajectories.\n\n>\n\nPart of the current nervousness comes from the numbers. In the first half of 2025, investment in information processing equipment and software made up an unusually large share of US GDP. That share climbed to levels last seen during the dot-com bubble in 2000.\n\nBeinsure [analyzed S&P report](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/10/global-economic-outlook-october-2025) and highlighted key medical cost trends.\n\nThe concentration is striking – it underscores how much of US growth is being powered by AI-related bets, and why any correction could turn from sector-specific to systemic in a hurry.\n\n# GDP Growth Predictions and Future Economic Trends\n\nOur big picture assessment of growth prospects is broadly unchanged in October’s update, although considerable uncertainty continues to surround the base case.\n\n>\n\nThis is not expected to turn into a slump in 2026 thanks to a few tailwinds for growth. These include further falls in crude oil prices, feeding into lower inﬂation rates and more accommodative monetary policies.\n\n# World: Change in real GDP growth, 2023-2026 (%)\n\n[Source: Beinsure by S&P Global Market Intelligence data](https://preview.redd.it/krb1dvol7gyf1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e62941223a366d56f3426a2160f83b304473ae)\n\nAnnual real GDP growth projections for 2026 for the US, the eurozone, India and Russia have been lowered in October’s forecast round. As the revisions were minor outside of Russia, our global growth forecast for 2026 was trimmed only slightly from 2.7% to 2.6%.\n\nAt the same time, our global growth estimate for 2025 was lifted a notch, from 2.6% to 2.7%, as upward revisions in the US and India offset downward adjustments in Brazil and Russia. The changes to the 2025 estimates were again modest and largely reﬂect the evolution of recent data. \n\n# North America: Change in real GDP growth, 2023-2026 (%)\n\n[Source: beinsure.com by S&P Global Market Intelligence data](https://preview.redd.it/4wodtppu7gyf1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e70c2661cb6630f8a421954bf70e8194fbc9ff)\n\nUS trade policy uncertainty affects regional growth forecasts, with the US economy expected to outpace the Euro area. China faces weaker growth due to low business and consumer sentiment, while US tariffs may be mitigated by policy support, according to [Economic Risks Outlook](https://beinsure.com/global-infrastructure-gap/).\n\n>\n\nGeopolitical and tariff uncertainties dominate as Trump hits the ground running. Swiss Re Institute [forecast global real GDP growth](https://beinsure.com/global-economic-insurance-market-outlook/) at 2.8% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026, roughly in line with 2024.\n\nHowever, the distribution of risks is tilted to the downside, driven by geopolitical risk, the potential for disruptive policy changes, and financial market vulnerabilities.\n\n# Western Europe: Change in real GDP growth, 2023-2026 (%)\n\n[Source: beinsure.com by S&P Global Market Intelligence data](https://preview.redd.it/2x3diws78gyf1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=624ef1ecb1d2d910145e0ed44a3f5eca6ebceeb8)\n\nGlobal infrastructure [faces a $11.5 tn gap by 2035](https://beinsure.com/global-infrastructure-gap/), driven by energy transition, AI demand, and urban growth, requiring $4.2 tn yearly investment.\n\n* The U.S. will need to invest more than $1 trn in non-energy infrastructure over ten years, with roads accounting for the bulk.\n* China’s target runs to $1.5 trn, India close to $1 trn, while France, Germany, the UK, and Spain together require about $500 mn.\n* Altogether, global investment needs add up to $11.5 trn, two-thirds of it in emerging markets.\n* Latin America captures this tension perfectly: rising trade diversification and rerouting drive demand, but elevated risks complicate delivery.\n\n# Predictions for Monetary Policy Changes in 2025 and 2026\n\nLower inflation forecasts for 2026 point toward more central bank easing. Yet the persistence of core inflation continues to complicate the story.\n\nOur current outlook: the Fed delivers 25-basis-point cuts at its October and December 2025 meetings.\n\n>\n\nBut the risks aren’t trivial. Tariff-driven pressures could push prices higher and delay the path back to neutral. In our view, markets understate the chance that the Fed pauses its easing cycle in early 2026 before resuming later.\n\n# Consumer price inflation (% annual change)\n\n[Source: beinsure.com by S&P Global Market Intelligence data](https://preview.redd.it/iwjyj0if8gyf1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=79aa018a76099066b460bb5279f1feb96c7a55d2)\n\n# Trade frictions keep uncertainty elevated\n\nRising debt and deficits mean steeper yield curves, keeping financing costs from falling as much as policy rates suggest.\n\nAnd the sectors most sensitive to borrowing costs – manufacturing, construction – now account for a smaller slice of advanced economies than in past cycles.\n\n>\n\nThe barriers are increasingly structural, ranging from permitting delays and grid congestion to fragmented regulatory frameworks and institutional capacity gaps in EMDEs. Addressing these challenges will require a dual shift.\n\n.........................\n\nAUTHORS: **Ken Wattret** – Vice-President, Global Economics, [**Nataly Kramer**](https://beinsure.com/authors/nataly-kramer/) — Lead Editor of Beinsure Media"
