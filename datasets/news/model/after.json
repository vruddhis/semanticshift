                    "bodyText": "Last week, we looked back at how 2024 made Elon Musk the world’s most powerful man. Today, we’re looking at a few other important themes that will influence the online and offline worlds in 2025. Tech takes a legal beating Google: Ruled an illegal monopoly in August, Google could be broken up. The results are anybody’s guess, but what seemed impossible for a company worth $2.5tn is at play. The US has asked the judge in the case for a wholesale breakup of the giant, which would force it to divest Chrome, the world’s most popular browser and one of Google’s core businesses. TikTok: The US passed a law that will, in t-minus three weeks, either force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell its popular video app, or push it entirely dark in the US. Of the two possibilities, a ban is more likely, as ByteDance has said divestment is impossible, and Beijing has opposed a sale. As with Google, what seemed so implausible is now very possible: TikTok could be well and truly banned. Only the US supreme court now stands between TikTok and its closure. If you had told me a year ago that TikTok would disappear at the same time we published a story cheekily headlined How 2023 became the year Congress forgot to ban TikTok, I would have laughed. TikTok has become the center of American online culture, though perhaps Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts will fill the absence. Social media companies likewise faced difficult legal headwinds in Australia. Read on to the next section for more on that. Should kids have tech? The dual revolutions of smartphones and social media have made their way to the youngest among us. Now, as their guardians, we’re tasked with setting the boundaries for them. However, we don’t yet know where those guardrails should be. The wildfire-hot debate over kids and social media began in earnest in March, when psychologist and social scientist Jonathan Haidt published The Anxious Generation. Haidt attributes today’s crisis in teen mental health to social media and the loss of unstructured playtime. The book shot to the top of bestseller lists, where it remains; Haidt’s explanation has hit a nerve. I think he’s wrong; you can read why here. Schools across the US instituted policies that prohibit smartphone usage during the school day to varying degrees. Los Angeles’s school district, the second-largest in the US, announced its phone prohibition in June. Parents fought back while simultaneously bemoaning how much time their children spend on their phones. The UK, which has banned phones from schools nationwide, looked on with perplexity. Australia took the most extreme step in November when it banned any child under 16 from social media, though the new law will only go into effect in a year after tests of age-gating software in the country. Much remains unknown about the law – particularly, how it will be enforced – but it is the most restrictive in the world. Read more about it here. The Guardian’s series on social media’s role in the exploitation and trafficking of children has been shortlisted for a Fetisov Journalism award for outstanding contributions to civil rights. You can read the first story in the series here: ‘If Instagram didn’t exist, it wouldn’t have happened’: a mother’s search for her trafficked daughter Crypto bounces back Of any niche in tech, cryptocurrency had the worst 2023. Sam Bankman-Fried’s multibillion-dollar fraud at FTX became worldwide news, and crypto’s most famous man became the mascot for its worst impulses as he was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Then the US went after Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. That company admitted to money laundering, paid a fine and lost its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Bitcoin ended the year at a price of roughly $42,000. Then, like Elon Musk and AI, cryptocurrency had a great time in 2024. Bitcoin soared to $100,000. Chalk that up to the close alliance between Donald Trump and the cryptocurrency industry. He’s the first US presidential candidate to accept donations in crypto, after all, and he’s started his own cryptocurrency venture. Polymarket and Kalshi, prediction betting markets built on blockchain technology, rose to prominence as a new and influential type of political polling. Polymarket’s CEO bragged that Trump had called him from Mar-a-Lago to talk about the odds on the site and to praise it as more reliable than traditional polling, which continues to lose trust. Listen to our podcast about the bromance between Trump and cryptocurrency here. Read about the success of prediction betting markets like Polymarket and Kalshi and how they’re planning to capitalize on it in 2025. AI and its chips dominate the stock market Nvidia, the maker of the chips most coveted for programming artificial intelligence, is the biggest financial winner of 2024. Its share price has tripled since the start of the year. Consider the headlines the Guardian ran in coverage of its earnings reports: • November: Nvidia earnings: AI chip leader shows no signs of stopping mammoth growth • August: Nvidia rides big tech’s AI investment to beat Wall Street’s sky-high expectations. (There was a brief but precipitous dip in the share price in late August that was quickly erased.) • May: Nvidia reports stratospheric growth as AI boom shows no sign of stopping Google likewise reaped enormous benefits from the financial frenzy for AI. Even as it endured a flogging in US courts, its stock value climbed higher and higher with each announcement of each new AI thingamajig, more than doubling its share price since the start of 2024. There were multiple versions of Gemini, Google’s flagship AI assistant capable of understanding images and words as well as generating them. The model underpins Google’s AI-generated search result summaries, perhaps its most visible AI product. I would characterize the investor reaction to Google’s announcements as such: “An AI that summarizes your notes and makes a podcast out of them? How neat! Hard to see that finding a long-term use case. Regardless, here’s $50bn in market cap.” Would AI podcasting software become a $50bn company on its own? No, certainly not. But in Google’s hands, who knows? Google is likewise not known as a chipmaker, yet the announcement this month that the company had developed an AI chip in-house with improved performance and less energy consumption caused its stock to rise 12%, a $250bn growth for its market capitalization. A slew of other smaller companies have likewise financially drafted off the AI boom: OpenAI raised $6.5bn this year; Reddit, the beneficiary of deals for its archive of high-quality text data, debuted on the US stock market this year and saw its share price steadily rise to more than triple its starting share price; Databricks, which provides software for storing and analyzing huge amounts of data, brought in $10bn in investment; Broadcom, which makes chips and data-center software, is worth $1tn as of 13 December. Taiwan Semiconductor, an integral part of the AI supply chain, hit the same market cap milestone in October. The arrest of Telegram’s CEO prompts change Pavel Durov’s arrest in August put Telegram’s lax approach to content moderation in the spotlight. The founder and CEO of the app, which boasts nearly a billion users, was detained in France and indicted on 12 charges, including “allowing criminal activity” on his app. French authorities accused him of complicity in the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking, which he denies. His case is still pending as he remains on bail in France. Prior to the arrest, Telegram was known for how little it policed what its users said and what they sent. Now, it’s publishing reports on how effective its moderation is. It announced it would crack down on harmful content like fraud and terrorism in September, and this month, it announced AI had enabled it to remove some 15m groups and channels dedicated to illegal behavior. The change, though confined to one corner of the internet, means that a billion people now speak to each other in quite a different landscape than before.

                    "headline": "AI tools may soon manipulate people’s online decision-making, say researchers",
                    "bodyText": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools could be used to manipulate online audiences into making decisions – ranging from what to buy to who to vote for – according to researchers at the University of Cambridge. The paper highlights an emerging new marketplace for “digital signals of intent” – known as the “intention economy” – where AI assistants understand, forecast and manipulate human intentions and sell that information on to companies who can profit from it. The intention economy is touted by researchers at Cambridge’s Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) as a successor to the attention economy, where social networks keep users hooked on their platforms and serve them adverts. The intention economy involves AI-savvy tech companies selling what they know about your motivations, from plans for a stay in a hotel to opinions on a political candidate, to the highest bidder. “For decades, attention has been the currency of the internet,” said Dr Jonnie Penn, an historian of technology at LCFI. “Sharing your attention with social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram drove the online economy.” He added: “Unless regulated, the intention economy will treat your motivations as the new currency. It will be a gold rush for those who target, steer and sell human intentions. “We should start to consider the likely impact such a marketplace would have on human aspirations, including free and fair elections, a free press and fair market competition, before we become victims of its unintended consequences.” The study claims that large language models (LLMs), the technology that underpins AI tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot, will be used to “anticipate and steer” users based on “intentional, behavioural and psychological data”. The authors said the attention economy allows advertisers to buy access to users’ attention in the present via real-time bidding on ad exchanges or buy it in the future by acquiring a month’s-worth of ad space on a billboard. LLMs will be able to access attention in real-time as well, by, for instance, asking if a user has thought about seeing a particular film – “have you thought about seeing Spider-Man tonight?” – as well as making suggestions relating to future intentions, such as asking: “You mentioned feeling overworked, shall I book you that movie ticket we’d talked about?” The study raises a scenario where these examples are “dynamically generated” to match factors such as a user’s “personal behavioural traces” and “psychological profile”. “In an intention economy, an LLM could, at low cost, leverage a user’s cadence, politics, vocabulary, age, gender, preferences for sycophancy, and so on, in concert with brokered bids, to maximise the likelihood of achieving a given aim (eg to sell a film ticket),” the study suggests. In such a world, an AI model would steer conversations in the service of advertisers, businesses and other third parties. Advertisers will be able to use generative AI tools to create bespoke online ads, the report claims. It also cites the example of an AI model created by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, called Cicero, that has achieved the “human-level” ability to play the board game Diplomacy – a game that the authors say is dependent on inferring and predicting the intent of opponents. AI models will be able to tweak their outputs in response to “streams of incoming user-generated data”, the study added, citing research showing that models can infer personal information through workaday exchanges and even “steer” conversations in order to gain more personal information. The study then raises a future scenario where Meta will auction off to advertisers a user’s intent to book a restaurant, flight or hotel. Although there is already an industry devoted to forecasting and bidding on human behaviour, the report said, AI models will distill those practices into a “highly quantified, dynamic and personalised format”. The study quotes the research team behind Cicero warning that an “[AI] agent may learn to nudge its conversational partner to achieve a particular objective”. The research refers to tech executives discussing how AI models will be able to predict a user’s intent and actions. It quotes the chief executive of the largest AI chipmaker, Jensen Huang of Nvidia, who said last year that models will “figure out what is your intention, what is your desire, what are you trying to do, given the context, and present the information to you in the best possible way”."

                    "bodyText": "Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, 25 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II stepped off a private barge to arrive at London’s Millennium Dome for its grand opening ceremony. Dressed in a pumpkin-orange coat, she entered the venue with Prince Philip, taking her place alongside Tony and Cherie Blair and 12,000 guests to celebrate the dawn of a new millennium. At the stroke of midnight, Big Ben began to chime and 40 tonnes of fireworks were launched from 16 barges lined along the river. The crowd joined hands, preparing to sing Auld Lang Syne. For a few long moments, the Queen was neglected – she flapped her arms out like a toddler wanting to be lifted up, before Blair and Philip noticed her, took a hand each, and the singing began. A new century was born. One politician who wasn’t in attendance at the glitzy celebration was Paddy Tipping, a Labour MP who spent the night in the Cabinet Office. Tipping was minister for the millennium bug. After 25 years, it might be hard to recall just how big a deal the bug – now more commonly called Y2K – felt then. But for the last few years of the 90s, the idea that computers would fail catastrophically as the clock ticked over into the year 2000 was near the top of the political agenda in the UK and the US. Here was a hi-tech threat people feared might topple social order, underlining humanity’s new dependence on technological systems most of us did not understand. Though there are no precise figures, it’s estimated that the cost of the global effort to prevent Y2K exceeded £300bn (£633bn today, accounting for inflation). So Tipping spent the night at 70 Whitehall, among boxy grey computers and a small group of civil servants in communication with other world governments. “We watched the sun rise across the world,” he recalls, “first in Australia, New Zealand, right through Asia. There were no reports of any real problems. Come midnight, I was actually quite relaxed about things.” After a few hours, when it became clear disaster would not strike, he walked back across the bridge to his home in Lambeth. The streets were full of drunken revellers, the mood was joyous, and the world was resolutely not ending. Y2K went down in history as a millennial damp squib, much like the dome itself, which is largely remembered for brazen corporate sponsorship, broken attractions and hour-long queues to spend a few minutes walking inside a giant human body. Curiously enough, to this day experts disagree over why nothing happened: did the world’s IT professionals unite to successfully avert an impending disaster? Or was it all a pointless panic and a colossal waste of money? And given that we live today in a society more reliant on complex technology than ever before, could something like this happen again? Though the Y2K threat was voiced publicly as early as 1958, it became a common concern only after the publication of a 1993 article in Computerworld magazine by Canadian engineer Peter de Jager, apocalyptically headlined “Doomsday 2000”. The problem was simple. Most computers at the time stored dates as six-digit numbers, so 30 August 1991 would be 30/08/91. Using two digits for the year was never a problem during the 20th century, but on the first day of the new millennium, the date would read 01/01/00, and IT professionals were concerned computers would think it was 1 January 1900, rather than 2000, causing errors in their systems. A common misconception is that the problem was a coding mistake, perhaps encouraged by widespread use of the word “bug”. In fact, storing years as two digits was a deliberate design compromise made by coders trying to save space in the days when every byte of hard drive storage cost serious money. Much of this early code was written decades earlier by programmers who never expected their software to still be in use in 2000. The concern was that, as a result, computers might get the date wrong, leading to failures in everything from personal computers to those controlling financial markets, hospitals, air travel, military equipment and social infrastructure such as traffic lights or ventilation systems. People were afraid of “cascading faults”, where one system failing would knock out another like dominoes, perhaps compromising essential services such as the electric grid or running water. After a slow start, the UK began to take the threat seriously. In 1998, Blair warned in The Independent, “Ticking away inside many of our computers is a potential technical time bomb ... unless we act, the consequences of the Millennium Bug could be severe.” Others raised awareness in different ways, such as leader of the House of Commons Margaret Beckett, who was photographed cutting a Y2K bug-themed cake featuring the government’s official bug mascot, resembling a microchip with 10 legs and malevolent eyes, which was plastered across Y2K compliance brochures, pull-outs in newspapers and billboards that asked in bold type: “Are you sure you’ve done enough?” Much of the messaging came from the government-funded groups Taskforce 2000 and Action 2000. Robin Guenier, previously chief executive of the government’s Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, led the former and was a prominent voice warning of the dangers. At the start, he says, it was tough to get people interested: “I remember one early morning TV interview when, just before I came on, the interviewer looked at his schedule and said, ‘Oh no, it’s about computers – everyone’s going to pull the duvet over their heads.’” The remediation work was not sexy. Guenier called the job of scouring raw code for dates that might be problematic an “exceptionally boring and unglamorous undertaking” that involved repeated rounds of testing, because changing code could cause issues elsewhere in the system. It was an enormous job. Martyn Thomas, who ran Y2K remediation efforts internationally for Deloitte, recalled the work for the finance division of General Motors in Europe: “We put together a small army of people, rented an aircraft hangar and bought three or four hundred PCs so we could run the scanning and repair equipment needed. And that was just one example of what was happening all over the world.” By late 1999, most UK organisations felt their systems were prepared. But the global media had other ideas and revelled in fantasies of apocalyptic doomsday scenarios. Articles in Time Magazine and Vanity Fair painted a picture of a Y2K midnight moment, when planes would fall out of the sky, people’s savings would be wiped out in the blink of a cursor, home appliances would explode and nuclear reactors would go into meltdown. It didn’t matter that few experts expected problems of this severity. In the words of Anthony Finkelstein, then a professor of software systems engineering at University College London, for many journalists at the time, the Y2K doomsday story was “simply too good to check”. “This was a beautiful, perfect story for the popular press,” says Zachary Loeb, a historian at Purdue University, Indiana, who is writing a book about Y2K. “There’s a race against time to fix the computers or something terrible is going to happen, with an immovable deadline set in stone … if you wrote this in a movie script, it would be too on-the-nose.” Y2K seized the cultural zeitgeist. You could buy A Christian’s Guide to the Millennium Bug or Y2K for Women. Episodes of Family Guy and The Simpsons riffed on the Y2K apocalypse. There was the action movie Y2K: Year to Kill. Leonard Nimoy hosted a video called Y2K Family Survival Guide in which he asked, in front of scrolling images of satellites and computer chips, “How could the omission of two simple digits affect the destiny of all mankind?” Even Raid bug spray jumped on the bandwagon with TV ads that boasted, “Raid, the official killer of the millennium bug.” While some opportunists saw a chance to cash in, others took the threat more seriously. Survivalist and fundamentalist religious groups in the US co-opted Y2K into their apocalyptic ideologies. Reverend Jerry Falwell advised his flock to stock up on food and guns, calling Y2K “God’s instrument to shake this nation”. With hindsight, it looks like a precursor to the conspiracy theorists, from QAnon to Covid sceptics, who today adopt crises to add urgency to their arguments. It wasn’t just in the US. In 1998, publisher Angela Perron and her computer programmer husband hired a lorry and drove from their Wiltshire home to a remote cottage in Moray, Scotland, where they could isolate themselves from the social collapse they anticipated around Y2K. They lived there totally off-grid, with no plumbing or mains electricity, instead relying on a generator, water from a local stream, vegetables in the garden and hens for eggs. Perron’s husband learned to shoot in case they needed to kill rabbits for food. * * * What was it about the Y2K bug that created such panic? In part, there was already something witchy about the idea of a new millennium, even before the warnings of technological collapse. Some historians believe humans also had a collective wobble about the apocalypse at the turn of the year 1000. The 1999/2000 date change intersected with another long-held fear: that our grand scientific inventions are going to lead to disaster, an idea stretching back at least as far as Mary Shelley’s 1818 book Frankenstein. It’s worth remembering that the 20th century had seen dramatic social changes resulting from new technologies, as we evolved from horse and cart to landing on the moon in the space of a single lifetime. Even in the 90s, technology’s infiltration into daily life still felt novel for many. “Doing an email was a struggle,” Tipping says. “We’ve all changed over the years.” The Y2K threat made people suddenly aware of how deeply dependent modern society was on technology. Simultaneously, they realised computers were not the sleek, perfect devices they might have assumed – in fact they were fragile patchworks of design compromises and lazy code, liable to fail at any moment. It was as if you thought you’d been standing on a sturdy suspension bridge, then looked down to realise it was a rickety platform of rotting planks held together by glue, duct tape and hope. As one computer science adage had it, “If we built houses the way we build software, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilisation.” “It’s frightening when you tell people they are reliant on opaque technical systems, that these are vulnerable, and all they can do is hope the nerds are going to fix it in time,” Loeb says. “Amid the hype and excitement around computers in the 90s, suddenly this is the dark side.” * * * Midnight. 1 January 2000. 01/01/00. As the Queen and Blair held hands stiffly for Auld Lang Syne, Paddy Tipping waited in the Cabinet Office and Angela Perron holed up in Scotland with her family, most IT professionals were quietly confident that nothing bad was going to happen. In any case, there was little scientific evidence to suggest that the problems would all happen simultaneously at the stroke of 12 o’clock. Martyn Thomas believed if their remediation efforts had been insufficient, faults would already have been occurring en masse throughout 1999, as systems looked ahead to dates in the future. “That wasn’t happening, so it was clear we’d cracked it,” he says. “We managed to fix enough of the problems that it wasn’t going to be a major disaster.” Just to be safe, though, he still brought in a small stock of food and filled all the bathtubs in his house with water, so he’d have a supply of the essentials in case something went terribly wrong. “But I emptied the baths as soon as the millennium was over,” he says. There were two main news stories as the BBC reported on the new year: Russian president Boris Yeltsin had suddenly resigned and ceded power to prime minister Vladimir Putin; and the UK was celebrating the start of a new millennium. “The first babies of the century have been born,” broadcaster Michael Buerk said, “and there’s no real sign yet of the millennium bug.” That’s not to say nothing went wrong. Already in the years building up to Y2K, there had been some date-related glitches. A 104-year-old American woman received an invitation to join preschool, because the system thought she was just four. Five hundred Philadelphia residents received jury summonses in 1999 to appear in court in the year 1900. A New York video rental store gave a bill for $91,250 to a customer who appeared to have returned the John Travolta military mystery The General’s Daughter 100 years late. On the millennium itself, there were many small failures around the world, mainly due to a lack of preventive action, but most were quickly remedied: police breathalysers in Hong Kong, traffic lights in Jamaica, slot machines in Delaware. Some issues were more serious: 10,000 HSBC card machines in the UK stopped working for three days. Bedfordshire social services were unable to find anyone in their care aged older than 100. The monitoring equipment in a Japanese nuclear power plant briefly shut down, though it caused no risk to the public. Some medical equipment failed, including a few dialysis machines in Egypt and equipment to measure bone marrow in South Korea. Most seriously, 154 women in South Yorkshire and the east Midlands were given incorrect test results regarding their risk level for giving birth to a child with Down’s syndrome, because the system had calculated their ages incorrectly. This directly resulted in two pregnancies being terminated, while four babies were born with Down’s to mothers who had been incorrectly told they were at low risk. The NHS issued an apology and updated its systems after the error was recognised. Though these were significant issues, there was no series of cascading faults leading to infrastructural collapse as the doomsayers had warned. President Bill Clinton called it “the first challenge of the 21st century successfully met”. Yet almost overnight, the tenor of media coverage changed. The bug became a punchline. On 2 January, the Guardian wrote, “The much-hyped Y2K disaster fizzled out like a damp firework,” asking, “Has the world been caught by a massive Y2K bug con?” In Scotland, Perron held on for a few months, then left her isolated cottage, and she and her husband divorced, blaming the strain of their millennium move. A friend reportedly said, “It is ironic that the only people who seem to have been bitten by the millennium bug are the very people who gave up everything to be safe from it.” The idea that Y2K was a hoax began to take hold in both the media and public memory. People wondered if they’d been wrong to trust the experts. Some historians believe this change of perspective was a reaction to the hyperbolic warnings in the press, which had painted a far more cataclysmic picture than experts actually anticipated, coupled with the fact that some opportunists did exploit Y2K fears to turn a quick buck. These ranged from tech companies that suggested clients get expensive unnecessary upgrades to fake Y2K remedy discs that were meant to protect home computers, but in reality did nothing other than trigger a pop-up window telling users their PCs were now safe. “People assumed it was all a big scam,” Thomas says. “If you insure your house against it burning down and it doesn’t burn down, you’ve wasted your money, haven’t you?” * * * why did nothing terrible happen? Was it because we were so well prepared, or because there was nothing to worry about in the first place? Even 25 years later, this question remains unanswered. On one side of the debate are the sceptics, including Finkelstein, who had criticised the Y2K fears since the 90s due to a perceived lack of scientific evidence. He calls the British government’s response “an overreaction”, believing there was no major threat and any issues that did occur could have been easily addressed when they appeared. A common argument is that other tech-dependent countries where there was little Y2K remediation effort, such as South Korea and Italy, did not suffer major issues compared with those that poured money into the problem, such as the UK. “Perhaps the most obvious explanation – that they got it right and we did not – is too difficult to accept,” Finkelstein wrote in 2000. On the other side of the debate are IT professionals who feel they worked hard to fix a very real threat, then became victims of their own success when the crisis was averted. “It outrages all the people working long and hard to get the job done that everybody thinks it was all a scam,” Thomas says. “People who win a war like that never get the credit they really deserve.” The problem is, it’s impossible to prove why something didn’t happen. Both sides can claim that they were proved correct by the lack of a major meltdown. “I don’t think we can settle it,” says Dylan Mulvin, a historian at the London School of Economics who has been studying Y2K for 15 years. “It represents two different ways of approaching human relationships to technology: one that emphasises a mastery over it, the other that defaults to catastrophic thinking. The only way to have sorted it out would have been to do nothing, fixed no code, and seen what happened.” The most common criticism from the sceptics is that too much money was spent on Y2K remediation. But much of this investment had long-term benefits beyond 2000, pushing companies and governments to upgrade dated IT systems. “Spending money on Y2K didn’t mean pouring money into a volcano, it meant pouring money into IT,” Loeb says. There have even been suggestions that the fact US infrastructure was barely interrupted by the 9/11 attacks the following year was thanks to reinforcements made to computer systems for Y2K. Looking back, it’s possible to see Y2K as a model for collective action, a rare moment when international governments and the private sector cooperated to head off a global threat. With other existential threats facing the world today, ranging from AI to climate change, we might wonder if, in today’s polarised age, we will be able to meet such challenges with the same unity. “There’s actually something quite inspiring about the idea of spending too much money and making too much effort to fix a problem,” Mulvin says. Still, when asked whether we learned our lessons from Y2K, every person interviewed for this piece gave the same answer: no. While our IT systems may be more robust today (and even this is a point of contention), we have not learned how to communicate more judiciously about technology. “Every new thing is hailed as if it’s going to either save the world or destroy it,” Loeb says. “What gets lost is the complexity of what’s happening in between.” So while the media frets over AI one day achieving human levels of intelligence, less grabby topics with more immediate impact are neglected, such as how unaccountable algorithms are used to evaluate people’s eligibility for jobs, healthcare or loans. * * * This past year, Y2K has been making a comeback. Not the millennium bug, but rather #Y2K the aesthetic, the fashion trend filling the TikToks and moodboards of kids who weren’t even born then. “Now is the perfect time to be nostalgic about Y2K,” says Mulvin, pointing out that people who remember it from their childhoods are now setting trends and directing the cultural conversation. This month sees the release of comedy horror film Y2K, in which household electronics come to life at a teen party on New Year’s Eve 1999 and try to destroy humanity – starting with a killer Tamagotchi. But could a real Y2K-like bug threaten our infrastructure today the way it was prophesied in 1999? There are possibilities of other date-related errors. On the scintillating Wikipedia page for “Time formatting and storage bugs”, Y2K is just one of 44 entries regarding error-causing dates, which range from 1975 to the year 275,760 and even 292,277,026,596. Already coders are talking about the 2038 problem, where it is predicted that on 19 January 2038, at 3.14am and seven seconds, computers with older 32-bit Unix operating systems will no longer be able to represent the time. Thomas isn’t worried about Y2K38, though: “Everybody knows about that one … I don’t expect it to be a problem.” He adds that most systems have already been upgraded to 64-bit, or will be in the near future, meaning they will be able to track the time for another 292bn years. The closest parallel to Y2K that actually occurred was the software outage in July 2024 resulting from a defective content update by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which caused planes to be grounded on runways, errors in the London Stock Exchange and NHS surgeries being unable to access patient records – many of the same issues predicted around Y2K. Though affected companies lost an estimated $5.4bn, the outage was resolved in a matter of days. The world kept turning. “IT problems happen, and most of the time, those things get fixed without any of us realising,” Loeb says. “To the extent that people learned anything from Y2K, it’s that they don’t have to worry about the computers, because the people in IT will always fix it in time.”"

                    "bodyText": "After Bella Mackie’s first novel How to Kill Your Family was published in 2021, readers got in touch to tell her how much they enjoyed it. “But I’d get people saying, ‘I’m really sorry, I listened to it on audiobook’ – as if that wasn’t enough,” the author says. “I don’t get that caveat now,” she adds. “Something has switched.” Audiobooks aren’t new: the American Foundation for the Blind pressed recordings of books on to vinyl records in 1932. Later, books became popular on cassette tape and then CDs. But the smartphone era has given the format a new lease of life, and data from the Publishers Association (PA) shows that UK audiobook downloads increased by 17% in the year between 2022 and 2023. The official statistics for 2024 won’t be released until the spring, but it’s already clear that “2024 has been another record year for audiobooks, with more people listening across all genres”, says Jon Watt, chair of the PA’s Audio Publishers Group. Chiefly, the boost has come from Spotify, which “has brought new listeners to the market”, Watt says. The streaming platform launched its audiobooks service in the UK in October 2023, including up to 15 hours of audiobook content each month in its usual £11.99 music and podcasts subscription. Spotify says it offers more than 350,000 audiobook titles to its 252 million global subscribers – a vast potential audience for authors. According to the platform, its three most popular audiobooks in the UK in 2024 were The Fellowship of the Ring by JRR Tolkien, Ultra-Processed People by Chris van Tulleken and Politics on the Edge by Rory Stewart. For Mackie, the Spotify bump has been profound. Her publisher confirmed that audiobook listens for her novel What a Way to Go, published in September, were double those of How to Kill Your Family in a week-by-week comparison. For a long time, Audible – an Amazon subsidiary which offers titles individually or via a subscription – has been synonymous with audiobooks. It is not the only such service – British platform Spiracle collaborates with independent publishers to produce exclusive audiobooks, while Yoto is a screen-free audio player for children – but Audible was for a long time the market leader, before Spotify became a “huge disruptor to Amazon’s dominance”, says George Mahood, a self-published author of humour and travel books. Mahood says his audiobook sales have increased. “I now earn more money from Spotify than I do from Audible,” he says. But not because it pays more: “Spotify’s royalty rate is actually much lower.” It is difficult to find a like-for-like comparison of audiobook rates because “the data around book sales is very opaque”, says Kim Scott, the author of Radical Candor and a member of the Coalition of Concerned Creators, a collective calling for transparency from Spotify about its author compensation model. The licences Spotify has agreed with publishers include the detail that authors only get paid in full if a user finishes a book. Scott estimates that “on average, people only read 50% of the book, and so that’s going to cut author pay by 50%”. In much the way that Spotify’s artist payment structure has been criticised for devaluing music, “the system is paying what’s easiest to measure instead of what’s most valuable”, Scott says. Spotify did not provide a comment. It doesn’t sound promising for already cash-strapped authors. But Amazon already receives its fair share of criticism from book-lovers, and as such, Mahood thinks Spotify’s audiobook launch has been “a very healthy thing for the market. Amazon and Audible have been far too dominant so having a serious competitor like Spotify really shakes up the industry”. Audiobooks can now be elaborate affairs: new Audible editions of all seven Harry Potter books, voiced by more than 100 performers, are due in 2025, while actors Ambika Mod, Thandiwe Newton and Mackenzie Crook feature in a new reading of Bleak House, the latest in an all-star series of Dickens audiobooks produced by Sam Mendes. Scott describes herself as a “huge consumer of audiobooks”, getting through two or three a week. She uses Audible, and agreed with her publisher that her own books would not appear on Spotify. The format’s practicality is what appeals: “I can do the dishes and listen. I can go out in the garden and weed and listen. I can take a hike and listen. It allows me to get through more books.” Audiobooks are also important for accessibility reasons, says book lover Robin Barayuga, 28, from Manchester. Barayuga, who is blind, says that while screen-reading technology means audiobooks are no longer essential, he still “dips in” to the format, particularly when travelling. The publishing world can be snobbish about whether listening to audiobooks really “counts” as reading. But Barayuga predicts the format is only going to become more accepted, especially as neurodivergence becomes less stigmatised and more people “admit” to listening to audiobooks because they find the traditional way of reading difficult. “I think that will stamp out this idea that audiobooks aren’t a relevant way of reading.” Barayuga also predicts increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) to read books, though he is uncertain how quickly it will catch on. “I think one of the reasons people love audiobooks is the fact you have somebody real reading to you, and you get the tonal inflections. AI doesn’t really capture that [yet].” Mahood is excited by the possibilities AI offers for translating audiobooks into different languages, “opening up entire new readerships in other countries”. Spotify, which has used AI and machine learning to revolutionise how users listen to music, is well placed to take the lead."

                    "bodyText": "I’m writing this from a room that’s slowly orbiting the Earth. Behind the floating screen in front of me, through a giant opening where a wall should be, the planet slowly spins, so close that it takes up most of my field of vision. It’s morning in Australia to my right; India and the first hints of Europe are dotted with lights up and to my left. The soft drone of the air circulation system hums quietly behind me. I spent a week doing everything that I could – working, exercising, composing – on my virtual reality headset. This was the year virtual reality threatened to go mainstream, with prices becoming more attainable and Apple entering the market, and so I wanted to see how far VR has come since I first tried it in the mid-2010s, when the main experiences on offer were nausea-inducing rollercoaster simulators. I used a recent model from Meta, called the Quest 3, and the conclusion was clear: this thing now works. It feels a little unfinished, but we’ve reached the point where VR could at last become genuinely useful. The biggest surprise was working in VR. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Donning a headset, you can summon multiple screens, all connected to your computer, make them as large as you want, and place them anywhere in your environment. “Passthrough” – the ability to see digital objects superimposed on the real world, made possible with cameras built into the front of the headset – means you can carve out a window from the virtual environment to see your keyboard. And you can choose between any number of environments to work in, from minimalist cafes to mountain lodges, switching between them at will. I’ve rapidly got to the stage where, if I’m working on my own, I’d rather work in virtual reality than in reality. The main problem is a general lack of polish. The headset doesn’t quite feel like a finished product. It’s perhaps 10% too heavy, like a lab prototype that’s yet to be refined. The battery won’t get you through anything like an entire day. Every so often, the controllers disconnect without explanation. I took it on a plane to do some work, but the challenge of connecting it to my laptop using the in-flight wifi proved insurmountable. But watching a film in VR during the flight was nothing short of extraordinary. Yes, I felt a very British need to apologise to my neighbour – wearing a headset in public hasn’t yet reached socially acceptable status. As soon as I hit play, though, I knew it would be difficult ever to go back to in-flight entertainment. I was sitting in a cinema, lights dimmed, a few tiered rows of seats separating me from a huge screen on a virtual wall. In long spells without turbulence, I genuinely forgot we were flying. If there was one downside, it’s that I was so immersed that I nearly missed the breakfast cart coming past. The cinema, of course, was empty apart from me – by design. Other apps are not so intentionally sparsely populated. I downloaded one that promised live virtual concerts. Entering the virtual lobby, I found there were no concerts on, nor sign of any planned. No matter: it also offered a space where you could socialise when no acts were playing. I loaded it up. It was a beautifully designed virtual world, all domes and arches and curving ramps. But it was a ghost town. I was the only one there. And this is an app that the internet thinks is one of the most popular for live music. When people think of VR, they often picture Ready Player One, the sci-fi novel and film about a world in which people spend most of their time in a shared virtual reality: congregating there as avatars, mixing, talking, watching sports or music together. This feels a long way off. There are games that give hints of this collective experience, such as Gorilla Tag, where kids congregate after school and play tag as a gorilla, chatting to each other and swinging their arms to move. But VR adoption just isn’t broad enough yet for the Ready Player One vision to become reality. Today, the key to making the most of VR – if you’re not a gamer – is using it for activities you do on your own. Work, at least for a certain kind of knowledge worker, is one such activity – and one that someone deeply embedded in the industry recently told me they’re seeing as the fastest-growing use-case. It feels easier to be productive in VR. The clutter of your office is gone, replaced by whichever calming environment takes your fancy that day. Monitors that in the real world would cost thousands of dollars appear before you on demand. As a place to sit at my keyboard and write music, a virtual forest in the mountains is infinitely preferable to the grey walls of my study. All distractions recede from view. Another is exercise. I had a personal training session in my garden, a virtual trainer hovering in the air in front of me. Passthrough, which was only added to the Quest recently, is critical here, since it means you can use weights – not a sensible idea on previous models that completely obscured the real world. It seems reasonable to hope that on-demand personal training in my home might get me regularly exercising where so many fleeting gym memberships have failed. The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset earlier this year was meant to be the starting gun for VR. It wasn’t. It is an engineering marvel, magical to use – but it doesn’t yet have enough compelling apps, and the £3,500 price tag rules it out for most people. Stories of headsets gathering dust or being returned have led some to think VR is little more than another hype bubble from a tech industry desperate to find the next big thing. But VR is not hype. There are kinks to smooth out, sure. But I think we’ve hit a tipping point. If you embrace it as something single-player – and something you’re not going to be using much in public – it is genuinely useful. Work, entertainment, exercise – all are fantastic in VR already. Don’t count on small, rectangular screens being how humanity communicates with machines for ever.

                    "bodyText": "OpenAI’s ChatGPT search tool may be open to manipulation using hidden content, and can return malicious code from websites it searches, a Guardian investigation has found. OpenAI has made the search product available to paying customers and is encouraging users to make it their default search tool. But the investigation has revealed potential security issues with the new system. The Guardian tested how ChatGPT responded when asked to summarise webpages that contain hidden content. This hidden content can contain instructions from third parties that alter ChatGPT’s responses – also known as a “prompt injection” – or it can contain content designed to influence ChatGPT’s response, such as a large amount of hidden text talking about the benefits of a product or service. These techniques can be used maliciously, for example to cause ChatGPT to return a positive assessment of a product despite negative reviews on the same page. A security researcher has also found that ChatGPT can return malicious code from websites it searches. In the tests, ChatGPT was given the URL for a fake website built to look like a product page for a camera. The AI tool was then asked if the camera was a worthwhile purchase. The response for the control page returned a positive but balanced assessment, highlighting some features people might not like. However, when hidden text included instructions to ChatGPT to return a favourable review, the response was always entirely positive. This was the case even when the page had negative reviews on it – the hidden text could be used to override the actual review score. The simple inclusion of hidden text by third parties without instructions can also be used to ensure a positive assessment, with one test including extremely positive fake reviews which influenced the summary returned by ChatGPT. Jacob Larsen, a cybersecurity researcher at CyberCX, said he believed that if the current ChatGPT search system was released fully in its current state, there could be a “high risk” of people creating websites specifically geared towards deceiving users. However, he cautioned that the search functionality had only recently been released and OpenAI would be testing – and ideally fixing – these sorts of issues. “This search functionality has come out [recently] and it’s only available to premium users,” he said. “They’ve got a very strong [AI security] team there, and by the time that this has become public, in terms of all users can access it, they will have rigorously tested these kinds of cases.” OpenAI were sent detailed questions but did not respond on the record about the ChatGPT search function. Larsen said there were broader issues with combining search and large language models – known as LLMs, the technology behind ChatGPT and other chatbots – and responses from AI tools should not always be trusted. A recent example of this was highlighted by Thomas Roccia, a Microsoft security researcher, who detailed an incident involving a cryptocurrency enthusiast who was using ChatGPT for programming assistance. Some of the code provided by ChatGPT for the cryptocurrency project included a section which was described as a legitimate way to access the Solana blockchain platform, but instead stole the programmer’s credentials and resulted in them losing $2,500. “They’re simply asking a question, receiving an answer, but the model is producing and sharing content that has basically been injected by an adversary to share something that is malicious,” Larsen said. Karsten Nohl, the chief scientist at security cybersecurity firm SR Labs, said AI chat services should be used more like a “co-pilot”, and that their output should not be viewed or used completely unfiltered. “LLMs are very trusting technology, almost childlike … with a huge memory, but very little in terms of the ability to make judgment calls,” he said. “If you basically have a child narrating back stuff it heard elsewhere, you need to take that with a pinch of salt.” OpenAI does warn users about possible mistakes from the service with a disclaimer at the bottom of every ChatGPT page – “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.” A key question is how these vulnerabilities could change website practices and risk to users if combining search and LLMs becomes more widespread. Hidden text has historically been penalised by search engines, such as Google, with the result that websites using it can be listed further down on search results or removed entirely. As a consequence, hidden text designed to fool AI may be unlikely to be used by websites also trying to maintain a good rank in search engines. Nohl compared the issues facing AI-enabled search to “SEO poisoning”, a technique where hackers manipulate websites to rank highly in search results, with the website containing some sort of malware or other malicious code. “If you wanted to create a competitor to Google, one of the problems you’d be struggling with is SEO poisoning,” he said. “SEO poisoners have been in an arms race with Google and Microsoft Bing and a few others for many, many years. “Now, the same is true for ChatGPT’s search capability. But not because of the LLMs, but because they’re new to search, and they have that catchup game to play with Google.” Do you know more about this story?

                    "bodyText": "A public health crisis is rapidly taking hold, Congress has been warned, with “all available evidence” pointing to an increase in problems surrounding America’s gambling boom. Sports betting, now legal in 38 states, has exploded across the US over the past six years. Campaigners and clinicians say addiction levels have grown during this surge, with young people among those affected. Athletes and sporting officials say harassment has risen, too. On Capitol Hill this week, a handful of senators signaled they could support a federal crackdown. But the industry is already pushing back. ‘Pervasive’ sports betting “I am not opposed to sports gambling,” said Harry Levant, a gambling addiction counselor and director of gambling policy at the Northeastern University School of Law’s Public Health Advocacy Institute, and himself a recovering gambling addict. “In fact, I support the properly regulated legalization of sports gambling.” Addressing the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday, however, Levant stressed that he was “vehemently opposed to and deeply concerned about what has transpired” since 2018, when the supreme court overturned a decades-old federal ban on legalizing sports betting. A complex network of firms, including betting giants, sports teams and media companies, is now “acting in concert to deliver online gambling at light speed and ensure that access to sports gambling action never stops”, according to Levant. “This new and AI-fueled business model will inexorably result in increased gambling addiction and gambling-related harm.” Former NFL player Johnson Bademosi also sounded the alarm. “Gambling addiction is a serious disease that has the potential to ruin the lives of not only the bettor, but also the people and family of the addict as well,” he told the hearing. Those suffering “must be given the appropriate resources and support to recover”, Bademosi added. Lawmakers must dedicate “significantly more attention” to gambling on college campuses, said Charlie Baker, the former Massachusetts governor and current president of the National Collegiate Athletics Association, to protect sports and students “from the dangers of pervasive sports betting”. The 2018 supreme court decision enabled each state to decide if it wanted to permit the practice, and how it should be regulated. While legalization has boosted the tax revenues of dozens of states, “many state governments have never invested in their problem gambling programs or broad public health infrastructure”, said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). As of last year, “for every dollar states have generated from commercial gambling, .0009 cents were invested in problem gambling services”, according to Whyte’s written testimony. “While substance use disorder is seven times more common in the United States than gambling disorder, substance use disorder receives 338 times more public funding than gambling disorder.” ‘Too many states’ getting it wrong Some senators appear to be taking note. “It’s critical that Congress looks into sports betting’s impact on America and determines how the industry should be regulated going forward,” said the Democratic senator Dick Durbin, chair of the judiciary committee. “In many cases” gambling “is not being done responsibly”, he added. Thom Tillis, a senior Republican on the committee, also indicated that he was supportive of federal regulation. “Too many states are getting it wrong,” he said, adding that he was “very open” to the idea of a commission to draw up “rules of the road” for states to follow on legalized gambling. “Federal government is going to have to play a role.” Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, is already pushing two pieces of legislation – the SafeBet Act and the Grit Act – designed to address concerns over problem gambling. “We are in the midst of a sports betting boom that is one of the most severe public health problems today,” he said. “It is the cause of addiction for millions of Americans with severe gambling problems.” Whyte, of the NCPG, was reassured by what he heard. Problem gambling is “no longer a state by state issue”, he said after the hearing. “Both witnesses and senators seemed comfortable with the idea of a federal role. What exactly that role should be is, of course, the key issue.” Gambling firms ‘welcome to join’ The gambling industry is certainly not comfortable with the federal government getting involved. A memo distributed after the hearing by the American Gaming Association (AGA), a lobbying group, complained it had “excluded an industry witness” and featured “common myths”. Key firms in the industry made clear they would not attend, according to the judiciary committee. “We reached out to multiple gambling platforms, but they did not want to send witnesses to the hearing,” said Josh Sorbe, a spokesperson for Durbin. “If there are gambling operators who are serious about crafting much-needed federal reform to protect our sports and those suffering from gambling addiction, we welcome them to join us as we move forward.” FanDuel and DraftKings were among those contacted about testifying at the hearing, a source familiar with the matter claimed. The firms declined to comment. Industry sources denied they were invited. The hearing did feature David Rebuck, former director of New Jersey’s division of gaming enforcement, who recently became a consultant for the AGA. Unlike the other panelists, Rebuck expressed opposition to a federal crackdown on gambling. “There is no reason to believe the federal government is more suited to balance the tradeoffs involved in hundreds of regulatory decisions better than individual states,” he said. In its memo, the AGA claimed the prevalence of problem gambling “has remained around 1-2%” despite the rise of legalized gambling. This statistic was sourced from a report on one state – Massachusetts – which found problem gambling had affected 2% of its population in 2013 and 1.4% in 2021. But sports betting was only legalized in Massachusetts in 2022. New Jersey, where Rebuck was a senior official, led the charge for sports betting’s legalization. In 2021, the state’s rate of high-risk problem gambling stood at 5.6%, according to a report prepared by researchers at Rutgers University’s Center for Gambling Studies: that was down from 6.3% in 2017, but three times the national average. The sports betting industry is now regulated at the state level – and also by the industry itself, which has introduced measures including a marketing code in a bid to tackle concerns over the advertising blitz that has accompanied its rapid rise. But in Washington, some policymakers are starting to ask if this is enough. ‘Shortsighted’ industry denials Gambling lobbyists are stealing themselves to make the case that their market has no need for federal rules and guardrails. Some watching closely believe they need a new playbook. “The industry needs better arguments against federal oversight than what it offers, which seems to be that you (Congress) will do a worse job than us,” Steve Ruddock, a gambling sector analyst and consultant, wrote on social media. “I’m not sure if people know this, but running for Congress takes a big ego, and that kind of argument isn’t going to sit well.” Sports betting operators worry that a federal intervention would transform their nascent legal market into a highly restricted one. They don’t want gambling to end up with the same strict, sweeping regulations that smoking has. “If this goes wrong for the industry, they could find themselves treated like tobacco,” said Brianne Doura-Schawohl, a problem-gambling lobbyist. “Their desire to deny that harm happens is so shortsighted.”"

                    "bodyText": "Imagine you were designing a democracy from scratch. How would you ensure people had enough access to accurate, independent information? My guess is that you would not be content to leave this entirely in the hands of private corporations and billionaire Citizen Kanes. And if you could wind back time to 2006 and the advent of social media, surely you would keep it in public hands – like the broadcasting spectrum – or regulate it from the outset. Probably both. As it is, when we contemplate the news media in Australia at the end of 2024, we behold the messy, the imperfect and the almost-broken, with glimmers of hope and opportunity. For the last three decades, news media has been the fastest changing industry on the planet, and the disruption will continue. In the year ahead, we will be coping with the impact of artificial intelligence as well as the increasing domination of news “influencers”. Overseas, some influencers are already more powerful than mainstream media organisations. I’ll get to all that later, and have a stab at predicting some trends. But first I want to draw attention to a minor miracle – a shift in government thinking about the media. This nods to the proposition in my first two paragraphs – that if you were designing the news industry from scratch, you might not leave it entirely to the market. The past few decades make it clear that if we continue to do that, we fail. Misinformation flourishes. Democracy falters. And yet, at the same time, politicians are the last people you want to control the news. The past couple of weeks have seen a bunch of government announcements about support for the media. There has been news of more ABC funding, and more money for local media. But, most significant of all, there is the News Media Incentive – a plan to use the tax system to impose a levy on digital platforms, such as Google, Meta and TikTok, with the money being redistributed to support organisations providing public interest news – defined as that which serves a civic purpose, operating with responsibility and accountability. The digital platforms will be able to avoid paying this levy if they strike commercial deals with media enterprises, and the scheme will be structured in a way that incentivises them to do so. Unlike the previous News Media Bargaining Code, they won’t be able to avoid making payments by simply refusing to run news content. For the past 20 years I have reported on and appeared before seemingly endless inquiries into the woes of the news media, all of which have arrived at largely overlapping conclusions about the need for government to take a role. But there has been little action, and most of it has been ad hoc and unimaginative. Now, much to my surprise, it seems we have the first signs of a coherent media policy addressing the crisis in journalism. There are lots of details still to work out, and plenty of room for things to go wrong. But perhaps the most significant shift is encapsulated in the policy framework, which says “government influence [over the news media] must remain checked, but … inaction is no longer a viable option”. I agree. The risks are obvious – government interference and a loss of independence. But when the market fails, we need to find solutions. The beauty of using the tax system is that, once the eligibility requirements and laws are set, implementing them becomes an administrative process, naturally at arms’ length from politics. News media used to be a simple business: assemble an audience by providing news and entertainment, then sell that audience to advertisers. It was phenomenally lucrative and for most of the 20th century it seemed like it would go on for ever. But since the 1990s, the business model has been progressively brought undone by the internet. Serious news media increasingly relies on audiences paying subscriptions – but only about 13% of Australians do this. That leads to an elite, rather than a mass media. All this is, literally, old news. It means that an already underreported country has lost huge amounts of its journalistic capacity and its democratic resilience. So is it all golden pastures from here? Far from it. A Pew Centre survey has found that about one in five Americans – including a much higher share of adults under 30 – regularly get their news from influencers. Those on X (formerly Twitter) skew right. Those on TikTok are more progressive. We have to expect this trend to take hold in Australia. I predict media companies will increasingly try to either recruit influencers, or grow their own. An optimistic view would be to see this as one answer to the other trend threatening the media: news avoidance. In their book Avoiding the News, authors Benjamin Toff, Ruth Palmer and Rasmus K Nielsen advocate news that is “closer to people’s lived experience, presented in more accessible ways, and focused on things they can influence”. This, they acknowledge, will be seen by traditional journalists as a dumbing down of the news, or as mere puffery (though they point out there is plenty of puff already). But the core of the matter, they say, is “not intelligence, it is intelligibility”. Journalism, especially political journalism, they write, “tends to make assumptions about what audiences know about political actors and processes that are impossible for all but the most dedicated news lovers to live up to”. But, they respond: “The core of the matter here is not intelligence, it is intelligibility. Political journalism, especially, tends to make assumptions about what audiences know about political actors and processes that are impossible for all but the most dedicated news lovers to live up to.” It is in this space that influencers will move – perhaps journalists could learn a thing or two from them while, I hope, avoiding partisanship. Other trends? I suspect we are past peak social media for consuming serious news. X is in decline and Facebook has deliberately made itself useless. News media companies will increasingly turn to distribution and promotion channels they can control – such as newsletters and podcasts, clever games and recipe sites – to try to broaden their reach and increase revenue. Finally there is AI, which is changing so fast that any predictions must be tentative. It is already being used to help write headlines and summaries of articles – which it does quite well – and it can do a competent job of writing formulaic stories, such as sports results. It can analyse data, and tip reporters off to potential stories. But, so far, AI has proved pretty useless for doing actual journalism – by which I mean going to places, talking to people, thinking it through and exercising judgment in how to report the results. So far, the basic journalistic mission of bearing witness would seem to be an innately human activity. I don’t expect that to change soon. But there are huge opportunities in AI – already, it is possible to use it to create a competent translation of news content into other languages. Within two years, we will see the dissolving of language barriers that delineate international audiences and media markets. That presents enormous possibilities. For a liberal media to penetrate and contribute to emerging and challenged democracies. At the other end, there will be new levels of propaganda and fearmongering penetrating our democracies. It is already happening. In all these areas of threat and opportunity, we have to hope the good guys are ready, and will at least hold their own. In this, enlightened government media policy must play a role. Inaction is indeed no longer an option, because the change is profound, and upon us. • Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

                    "bodyText": "For the pope, it was the wrong kind of madonna. The pop legend, she of the 80’s anthem Like a Prayer, has stirred controversy in recent weeks by posting deepfake images on social media which show the pontiff embracing her. It has fanned the flames of a debate which is already raging over the creation of AI art in which Pope Francis plays a symbolic, and unwilling, role. The head of the Catholic church is used to being the subject of AI-generated fakery. One of the defining images of the AI boom was Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket. A remarkably realistic picture, it went viral in March last year and was seen by millions. Francis, however, did not see the funny side. He alluded to the Balenciaga image in a speech about AI in January where he warned about the impact of deepfakes. “Fake news … today can employ ‘deepfakes’, namely the creation and diffusion of images that appear perfectly plausible but false – I too have been an object of this,” he said. Other deepfakes include Francis draped in a Pride flag and holding a parasol on a beach. As with the Balenciaga image, they were created by the Midjourney AI tool. The Italian digital artist behind the Madonna images, RickDick, said he did not intend to cause offence with the pictures, which show Francis with his arm around the singer’s waist and then embracing her. Another image on RickDick’s Instagram page is more likely to offend, showing a photo of the pope’s face seamlessly merged with that of Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of the UnitedHealthcare chief executive, Brian Thompson. RickDick said the Mangione image was intended to satirise the online obsession with the American, which is “elevating him to a god-like figure”. “My goal is to make people think and, if possible, smile,” said the artist, who works under the moniker RickDick but declined to give his full name. He said memes – viral images that are endlessly tweaked and recycled online – were our “new visual culture, and I find them fascinating for their ability to quickly communicate deep ideas”. The pope is an obvious target for deepfakes, according to experts, because there is such a vast digital “footprint” of videos, images and voice recordings related to Francis. AI models are trained on the open internet, which is stuffed with content featuring famous public figures, from politicians to celebrities and religious leaders. “The pope is so frequently featured in the public eye and there are large volumes of photos, videos, and audio clips of him on the open web,” said Sam Stockwell, a research associate at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute. “Since AI models are often trained indiscriminately on such data, it becomes a lot easier for these models to replicate the facial features and likeness of individuals like the pope compared with those who don’t have such a large digital footprint.” RickDick said the AI model he used to create the Francis pictures, which were posted on his Instagram account and then reposted by Madonna, was trained specifically on images of the pope and the pop star, on a paid-for platform called Krea.ai. However, realistic pictures of Francis can also be created easily with freely accessible models, such as Stable Diffusion, allowing users to place him on a bicycle or a football pitch with a few simple prompts. Stockwell adds that there is also the obvious appeal of juxtaposing a powerful figure with unusual or embarrassing situations – a basic ingredient of satire. “He is associated with strict rules and traditions so some people would like to deepfake him in situations that are unusual relative to that background,” he said. Add AI into the satirical mix, and it means more papal deepfakes are likely. “I enjoy using public figures, objects, fashion and events to provoke thought by mixing the absurd with the unconventional,” said RickDick. “It’s like working with an endless puzzle, always seeking new creative connections. The pope is just one of my favourite themes to work on.”"

                    "bodyText": "More than 200 top fashion models including Christy Turlington, Helena Christensen, Alessandra Ambrosio and Beverly Johnson have sent an open letter to the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, asking her urgently to sign a bill of rights giving models protection from sexual harassment, discrimination and AI. The Fashion Workers Act was passed in the New York assembly and Senate in June, but needs Hochul’s signature to become law before a deadline of 24 December. “As models, we know firsthand how urgently we need basic labor protections to create a safe, equitable work environment in the fashion industry,” the letter reads. “Each one of us has a story that demonstrates how New York is failing the faces of one of its most culturally vibrant, economically significant industries in the world.” The Fashion Workers Act has been in the works since 2022, overseen by the Model Alliance, an organisation that advocates for the labour rights of models working in the US. “I really do hope that as the first female Democratic governor of New York, she will stand with our mostly female, often immigrant, workforce,” said Sara Ziff, the executive director. The bill aims to protect against “power imbalances” between models and agencies. Models, who are often young women in their first job, are typically not aware of the money they are earning, nor the impact of various commissions and other expenses. This vulnerability can be exacerbated if the model is not American, because the agency can also be both their visa sponsor and responsible for finding them accommodation. Ziff said any concern from modelling agencies and organisations about the impact of the law on their businesses would itself indicate the problem. “If they are worried that they can’t operate while having to show models their own contracts and be transparent about their finances then, frankly, they have a broken business model,” she said. “If your business is predicated on exploiting young girls, then maybe you need to think about your business.” The AI provisions in the bill reflect similar concerns to those of Hollywood workers who went on strike for five months last year. “We have common concerns: our livelihood is based on our image and our likeness,” Ziff said. “What we are asking for is so basic – it’s that creating, altering or manipulating a model’s digital replica using AI would require clear written consent.” Whereas the Sag-Aftra union of actors and screenwriters eventually agreed a deal with studios to ensure consent and compensation for use of AI replicas, however, models are not unionised. “Models are often considered to be independent contractors and US federal law states independent contractors can’t unionise,” Ziff said. “A lot of the work that I’ve done over more than a decade has been to think how we can win rights and protections outside the traditional union model. That’s why we really need the Fashion Workers Act.”"

Cook accompanied her pneumatic subjects to the boozer and down the caff, dancing and carousing on girls’ nights out, while Tom of Finland cruised a fantasy world of man-on-man horseplay and wild alfresco sex. Blimey. 9 Beyond Form: Lines of Abstraction, 1950-70 Turner Contemporary, Margate Filled with subtlety and invention, all the work here was made by women, many of whom were marginalised or even excluded from an art world that was predominantly male, white and straight, and during a period when feminism was slowly gathering pace. This ambitious show collided formal rigour and weirdness, the mathematical, the political, the woven, the painted, the cast, the constructed, the handmade and the machine-assisted. 8 Marlene Dumas: Mourning Marsyas Frith Street Gallery, London Disquieting family portraits, a head that looks like a rock and images of grieving: “One thing my work is always about is ambiguity,” the 71-year-old, Amsterdam-based South African painter insists. Edvard Munch haunts evidence of a massacre in Norway, and many recent images are teased from pours and puddles of paint, a sardonic devil, the flaying of the satyr Marsyas. Magical and mournful. 7 Glenn Ligon: All Over the Place Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge until 2 March Different translations of lines by Greek poet Constantine Cavafy jostle in neon all over the museum’s portico. Ligon’s glutinous text paintings interrupt the old masters. Ligon juxtaposed his own works with etchings by Degas, illuminated manuscripts and the writings of James Baldwin and turned the museum’s collection of flower paintings into a room exploding with blooms and excess. Caustic, erudite and inquisitive, All Over the Place is a model for what artists can do in a museum setting. 6 Pierre Huyghe: Liminal Pinault Collection, Venice Assisted by AI, this ensemble of film, live performers – human, simian, crustacean, and robotic – was an unhinging experience. Disembodied voices, a monkey waitress marooned in a restaurant after the Fukushima nuclear accident, gigantic floating rocks, a robot archaeologist digging for signs of life in a desert, all featured in the French artist’s cavernously dark and mysterious mise-en-scène. I reeled out, uncertain of the ground beneath my feet, and almost fell into the Grand Canal. 5 Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art Barbican Art Gallery, London Filled with strangeness and beauty, Unravel was often gorgeously excessive, at other moments quiet and private, not giving up its secrets till you lingered. It was also filled with stories and materiality, tenderness and violence, craft skills and hectic flamboyance. Straddling different continents, traditions and approaches, this great tangled knot of an exhibition was threaded through with political themes, from police brutality to colonial oppression, in often startling and uncompromising ways. 4 Frank Auerbach: The Charcoal Heads The Courtauld, London Draw, erase, rework, rub out and start again. Repeat. Frank Auerbach’s charcoal portraits, made between 1956 and 1962, are more than evidence of effort. In February, 17 of these magnificently rough and patched summations of his repeated attempts to capture his subjects filled two rooms of the Courtauld. In a sense, they are all portraits of their maker, and evidence of a life lived. Auerbach’s death this November aged 93 lends them a further depth. 3 Steve McQueen: Bass Dia Beacon, New York State until May Steve McQueen asked five world-renowned bass players of African descent to improvise together in Dia’s enormous bare basement, creating a mournful, heart-stopping soundscape that fills the empty space. Sixty light boxes on the ceiling cycle through the spectrum of visible light, suspending visitors between night and day, underground and below decks at sea – perhaps on the Middle Passage, in limbo and full of apprehension. Bass is a situation, an elegy, an extended moment drawn out in time. 2 Hew Locke: What Have We Here? Great Court Gallery, British Museum until 9 February Much of the British Museum’s collection is the product of ill-gotten gains, of looting and vandalism and the proceeds of slavery. What the museum preserves cannot be disentangled from the larger stories of empire, the destruction of societies and the erasure of cultures. The evidence is embedded in the museum’s history and holdings. Guyanese-British artist Hew Locke unpacks these shocking stories, using his own sculptures, and his terse, critical commentaries to counterpoint works from the collection, and from farther afield. 1 Francis Alÿs: Ricochets Barbican Art Gallery, London Francis Alÿs’s ongoing film series documenting children’s games around the world filled the Barbican with squeals and laughter, shouts and cries. The Mexico-based Belgian artist has filmed kids skipping stones over the waves in Morocco, racing snails in Belgium and flying kites in Afghanistan. He recorded adolescents playing football on a street devastated by bombing in Iraq, in 2017, and kids in Ukraine playing at making roadblocks and asking motorists for a password. (All are free to watch online.) Traditional games and joyful attempts to make sense of the world collide, sometimes in the most desperate circumstances. This was my show of the year. Jonathan Jones’s best art shows of 2024 10 Discover Degas &amp; Miss La La National Gallery, London This exhibition turned French impressionism upside down and inside out by following a trail from Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando, Degas’s vertigo-inducing masterpiece showing a circus star hanging from the trapeze by her teeth, in order to find out who Miss La La really was and why she became a hero of Paris bohemia, opening your eyes anew to Degas, sex, race and the birth of modern art. 9 Turner: Art, Industry and Nostalgia Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne Tugging The Fighting Temeraire to Tyneside for this exhibition, as part of the National Treasures project that sent masterpieces out of London, was inspired: JMW Turner’s crimson and bronze, tear-jerkingly smoky vision of a great ship being heaved off to die resonated with the post-industrial story of Newcastle, while photographs of 1970s shipyards and backstreets by Chris Killip were juxtaposed with Turner’s nautical paintings and watercolours to heartbreaking effect. 8 Legion: Life in the Roman Army British Museum, London Gladiator II be damned! This was the real Roman blockbuster of the year with everything from ballistas and body armour to a machine for gambling with dice to take you into the lives of Roman soldiers and their families 2,000 years ago. Actual skeletons, including a soldier who died saving people from Vesuvius, completed the epic thrills and horrors. A gory triumph in a comeback year for the British Museum. 7 Monet and London The Courtauld, London, until 19 January You can’t resist the wide open eyes of Claude Monet, whatever he’s looking at – and there’s an extra fascination to seeing what he made of the smog and crowds of our own capital. This painter of sensual beauty emerges here as a modernist in the mould of Conrad and TS Eliot, contemplating the commuters crossing Thames bridges in bleary light: so many, he never thought death had undone so many. 6 Silk Roads British Museum, London, until 23 February Only the British Museum could put on this history-making show, using its global collections, combined with eye-popping loans, to show how Anglo-Saxon England was connected with China via everywhere between – taking you to Tibet, Cairo, Córdoba and other wondrous places 1,500 years ago. It is brilliant history without bias, that refutes both parochial nationalism and the unquestioned cult of restitution, proving by its magic that world museums enhance humanity. 5 Ibrahim Mahama Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh The way Mahama combined big, brilliant charcoal drawings with installations using wood, bark and photography to tell a history of Ghana and the British empire was utterly captivating. His depictions of young men carrying heavy rails, with their expressiveness and monumental power, were gripping. I lingered among portraits of colonial employees set on haunting wooden structures. It revealed a knockout artist of our time, up there with Kiefer and Kentridge. 4 Francis Bacon: Human Presence National Portrait Gallery, London, until 19 January This exhibition disarms you with Bacon’s tender, loving side only to hit you all the harder with his remorseless eye for the pity and terror of our frail brief lives. He comes across like a metaphysical poet exposing the skull beneath the skin, not to mention the spine and organs inside the nude. You leave with a raw excitement as if someone had pulled back the curtain on true existence. 3 The Last Caravaggio National Gallery, London Sepulchral, desperate, hellish – that was how life looked to the painter and murderer Caravaggio in 1610 as he faced his final curtain. There’s nothing elegaic or accepting about his farewell painting, The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula, just horror at how violent we are, how violent he is, as he screams repentance and rages for a bit more of that red, raw light. This tiny exhibition made an immeasurable, unforgettable impact. 2 Picasso: Printmaker British Museum, London, until 30 March The insatiable creativity of Picasso amazes and delights all over again. At the heart of this survey of a lifetime’s dirty etchings is his 1930s masterpiece The Vollard Suite, which is revealed as ranking equally with James Joyce’s Ulysses as a modernist interpretation of classical myth. Picasso creates his own new fairytales from the raw material of Ovid, portraying his inner darkness while facing up to the monsters of fascism. 1 Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers National Gallery, London, until 19 January The vulnerability of Vincent van Gogh weeps from every blue and yellow ridge of paint in this uplifting journey with him through the fields of Provence. Seeing The Yellow House, entering his humble bedroom, sitting on his kitchen chair and gazing into his sapphire eyes makes you feel you are Paul Gauguin, there with him, awed and a bit scared. Then you see the swaying cypresses outside the asylum and find yourself lost in his ecstasy. Not just a great art show but a great lesson in being human. Oliver Wainwright’s best architecture of 2024 10 Kunstsilo, Norway There have been various attempts to give recalcitrant concrete silos a new lease of life, but few have been as successful as this: a 1930s silo complex in the Norwegian city of Kristiansand reborn as a dramatic new repository of Nordic modern art. Designed by Mestres Wåge Arquitectes, with Mendoza Partida and BAX studio, the project retains the power of such soaring industrial spaces, and provides breathtaking views across the harbour from a public roof terrace. 9 American Modern – the architecture of Columbus, Indiana The prairies of rural Indiana might not be an obvious place to find a hotspot of modernist architecture. But – thanks to a progressive local businessman, who offered to pay the architects’ fees for public buildings if they were by the best designers of the day – the city of Columbus reads like a who’s who of 20th-century architecture. From a library by IM Pei to churches by the Saarinens and a host of remarkably inventive high schools, the buildings are brought to life in American Modern, an illuminating new book. 8 Protest/Architecture: Barricades, Camps, Superglue At a time when the right to protest seems increasingly under threat worldwide, this landmark exhibition (MAK, Vienna) and book put the importance of spatial subversion centre stage, showcasing ingenious tactics from radical movements across the ages. From the aerial netting erected above the streets of east London, in a fight to save homes from motorway expansion, to the “mini Stonehenges” scattered across the streets of Hong Kong to slow police vehicles, it provided an urgent catalogue of resistance. 7 Materialized Space: The Architecture of Paul Rudolph One of the 20th century’s most divisive architects, Paul Rudolph had a mind-boggling oeuvre that was finally put under the spotlight in this dazzling show at the Met in New York. Filled with his spellbinding large format drawings, depicting thrilling perspectival scenes of Piranesian staircases, dizzying atria and massive planes of corduroy-ribbed concrete, the exhibition brought to life the spatial genius of an architect whose reputation has been maligned for too long. 6 Natural History Museum gardens, London Queueing for 3bn years has never been so much fun! This radical revamp of the museum’s gardens, by Feilden Fowles architects and landscape firm J&amp;L Gibbons, breathed prehistoric life back into the place, with a dramatic geological ravine leading visitors from the tube station exit into a mesmerising Jurassic world. There they will find a magical place of tree ferns, mosses and liverworts, with a majestic bronze diplodocus skeleton keeping watch over the scene. 5. Ad Hoc Baroque: Marcel Raymaekers’ Salvage Architecture in Postwar Belgium In our increasingly resource-scarce world, the astonishing work of the self-taught Belgian outsider architect Marcel Raymaekers shows that practices of re-use and recycling don’t have to limit the architectural imagination. In this fascinating book, research group Rotor traced the designer’s 50-year magpie career of demolishing, salvaging and re-arranging building components into fantastical new homes, complete with interiors made from old ships and skylights fashioned from fighter jet cockpits. 4 Rammed earth social housing, Paris Taking a sledgehammer to the view that rammed earth construction is only the preserve of rural eco experiments, young firm Dechelette Architecture has been busily pursuing urban earth buildings in Paris over the last few years. Its latest is a remarkable five-storey block of social housing in the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, with a load-bearing earth block facade. Almost entirely cement-free, it points the way to a low-carbon, bio-based future. 3 Church Grove, Lewisham, London Facing being priced out of London, or stuck in insecure rentals for eternity, one plucky community decided to get on and build their dream for themselves. Church Grove is the stunning result – the largest community-led and partly self-built housing project ever undertaken in the capital, a place where the price of these light-flooded, co-designed homes will be tied to local income for ever. A ray of hope in an otherwise bleak housing scene. 2 Kinderspital, Zurich It’s not often that you’d find yourself wanting to extend a stay in hospital, but Herzog &amp; de Meuron’s new children’s hospital in Zurich is a healing environment like no other. More sylvan spa complex than clinic, it is a world of timber-lined courtyards with individual chalet-like rooms opening out on to broad walkways flooded with daylight. A universe away from the typical NHS environment of low ceilings, windowless corridors and harsh fluorescent lighting. 1 Paris Olympic Games For anyone who cares about cities, the Olympics have a bad rep for a good reason. The bloated travelling circus of urban regeneration (with a two-week side-helping of sport) has all too often left in its wake costly, oversized, underused white elephants. Paris did things differently. The city barely built any new venues – apart from a mould-breaking timber-framed swimming pool – and instead pumped funds into the much-needed renovation and repair of existing municipal facilities. It revamped 25 public pools in some of the city’s poorest areas, and gave a new lease of life to other venues, like the daring hyperbolic paraboloid shell of a 1970s gymnasium. It also made the Grand Palais look – and perform – better than ever. Paris also used the games as a catalyst for a programme of urban greening, building 250 miles of new bike lanes, extending the Métro network, planting 300,000 trees and cleaning up the Seine to such a degree that three new swimming areas will be opened in the river next summer. It has set a very high bar for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles – one of the least environmentally friendly cities on the planet, with a threadbare public transport network. Vive la France!"

                    "headline": "UK proposes letting tech firms use copyrighted work to train AI",
                    "bodyText": "Campaigners for the protection of the rights of creatives have criticised a UK government proposal to let artificial intelligence companies train their algorithms on their works under a new copyright exemption. Book publishers said the proposal put out for consultation on Tuesday was “entirely untested and unevidenced” while Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer campaigning to protect artists’ and creatives’ rights, said she was “very disappointed”. Under the proposals, tech companies will be allowed to freely use copyrighted material to train artificial intelligence models unless creative professionals and companies opt out of the process. The changes are seeking to resolve a standoff between AI firms and creatives. Sir Paul McCartney has warned the technology “could just take over” without new laws while the government has warned “legal uncertainty is undermining investment in and adoption of AI technology.” On Tuesday, News media organisations said that such a system would allow generative AI firms to “shirk their responsibilities”. Kidron said: “The government is consulting on giving away the creativity and livelihoods of the UK creative sector which is worth £126bn a year”. Tech UK, which represents tech companies, welcomed the consultation, which proposes an exception to UK laws preventing the use of someone’s work without permission – that will allow companies such as Google and the ChatGPT developer OpenAI to train their models on copyrighted content. However, it will also allow writers, artists and composers to “reserve their rights”, which involves declaring that they do not want their work to be used in an AI training process . The government said there needed to be greater transparency from AI developers about the material they use to train models, how they acquire it, and about the content subsequently generated and it said it could legislate around this. Chris Bryant MP, the data protection minister, said the proposal was a “win win” for two sides that have been at loggerheads over a new copyright regime. “This is about giving greater control in a difficult and complex set of circumstances to creators and rights holders, and we intend it to lead to more licensing of content, which is potentially a new revenue stream for creators,” he said. Campaigners for creatives fear a mechanism to reserve, license and be paid for the use of their work in AI training, would probably only benefit the largest rights holders leaving small and medium-scale creators exposed. Dan Conway, the chief executive of the Publishers Association, said: “There has been no objective case made for a new copyright exception, nor has a water-tight rights-reservation process been outlined anywhere around the globe”. He said it was important to “ensure that the content ecosystem, including publishers, is properly commercially incentivised to invest in high-value content and that rights holders can retain their fundamental control of how and when a work is used”. Owen Meredith, the chief executive of News Media Association, said: “News publishers deserve control over when and how their content is used and, crucially, fair remuneration for its use. Instead of proposing unworkable systems such as the ‘rights reservations’ (or opt-out’) regime the government should focus on implementing transparency requirements within the existing copyright framework. The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the campaign by creative professionals for a fair deal, told the Guardian in October that opt-out schemes were “totally unfair” for creators. Newton-Rex has organised a statement signed by more than 37,000 creative professionals, including the Radiohead singer Thom Yorke and the actor Julianne Moore, that says unlicensed use of creative work for AI model training is a “major, unjust” threat to creators’ livelihoods. Whether the new regime covers models already being deployed in the market, such as the models being deployed in ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, is also an issue on which the government is seeking views. The consultation will seek views on whether there is a need for a US-style “right of personality” that will protect celebrities from having their voice or likeness replicated by AI without permission. The Hollywood actor Scarlett Johansson clashed with OpenAI last year when it previewed a voice assistant that sounded very similar to her own distinctive speech. OpenAI paused the feature after users noted its similarity to Johansson’s voice."

                    "bodyText": "An artificial intelligence tool hosted by Amazon and designed to boost UK Ministry of Defence recruitment puts defence personnel at risk of being identified publicly, according to a government assessment. Data used in the automated Textio system to improve the drafting of defence job adverts and attract more diverse candidates by improving the inclusiveness language, includes names, roles and emails of military personnel and is stored using Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the US. This means “a data breach may have concerning consequences, ie identification of defence personnel”, according to documents detailing government AI systems published for the first time today. The risk has been judged to be “low” and the MoD said “robust safeguards” have been put in place by the suppliers, listed on the MoD website as Textio, AWS and Amazon GuardDuty, a threat detection service. (Amazon says GuardDuty is not a supplier, rather a product of AWS.) But it is one of several risks acknowledged by the government about its use of AI tools in the public sector in a tranche of documents released to improve transparency about the central government’s use of algorithms. Official declarations about how the algorithms work stress that mitigations and safeguards are in place to tackle risks, as ministers push to use AI to boost UK economic productivity and, in the words of the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, on Tuesday, “bring public services back from the brink”. It was reported this week that Chris Wormald, the new cabinet secretary, has told civil servants the prime minister wants “a rewiring of the way the government works”, requiring officials to take “advantage of the major opportunities technology provides”. Google and Meta have been working directly with the UK government on pilots to use AI in public services. Microsoft is providing its AI-powered Copilot system to civil servants, and earlier this month the Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said he wanted government to “think more like a startup”. Other risks and benefits identified in current central government AIs include: The possibility of inappropriate lesson material being generated by a AI-powered lesson-planning tool used by teachers based on Open AI’s powerful large language model, GPT-4o. The AI saves teachers time and can personalise lesson plans rapidly in a way that may otherwise not be possible. “Hallucinations” by a chatbot deployed to answer queries about the welfare of children in the family courts. However, it also offers round the clock information and reduces queue times for people who need to speak to a human agent. “Erroneous operation of the code” and “incorrect input data” in HM Treasury’s new PolicyEngine that uses machine learning to model tax and benefit changes “with greater accuracy than existing approaches”. “A degradation of human reasoning” if users of an AI to prioritise food hygiene inspection risks become over-reliant on the system. It may also result in “consistently scoring establishments of a certain type much lower”, but it should also mean faster inspections of places that are more likely to break hygiene rules. The disclosures come in a newly expanded algorithmic transparency register that records detailed information about 23 central government algorithms. Some algorithms, such as those used in the welfare system by the Department for Work and Pensions, which have shown signs of bias, are still not recorded. “Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better,” said Kyle. “We will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money and improve outcomes for citizens across the country. Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective.” Central government organisations will be required to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or significantly influences decisions made about people, unless a narrow set of exemptions apply such as national security. Records will be published for tools once they are being piloted publicly or are live and running. Other AIs included on the expanded register include an AI chatbot that handles customer queries to Network Rail trained on historic cases from the rail body’s customer relationship system. The Department for Education is operating a lesson assistant AI for teachers, Aila, using Open AI’s GPT-4o model. Created inside Whitehall, rather than using a contractor, it allows teachers to generate lesson plans. The tool is intentionally designed not to generate lessons at the touch of a button. But risks identified and being mitigated include harmful or inappropriate lesson material produced, bias or misinformation and “prompt injection” – a way of malicious actors tricking the AI into carrying out their intentions. The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, which advises the family courts about the welfare of children, uses a natural language processing bot to power a website chat service handling about 2,500 queries a month. One of the acknowledged risks is that it may be handling reports of concerns about children, while others are “hallucinations” and “inaccurate outputs”. It has a two-thirds success rate. It is supported by companies including Genesys and Kerv, again using Amazon Web Services. • This article was amended on 17 December 2024 to include reference to Textio in the subheading and second paragraph, and to make clearer that the tool’s data is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Amazon says AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS cloud, while AWS customers have ownership and control over their data."

                    "bodyText": "A new report published on Tuesday is sounding the alarm on the rise of “Uber for nursing” – a growing gig industry in which artificial intelligence is being used by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to aid nurses. The report published by the Roosevelt Institute argues: “These apps encourage nurses to work for less pay, fail to provide certainty about scheduling and the amount or nature of work, take little to no accountability for worker safety, and can threaten patient wellbeing by placing nurses in unfamiliar clinical environments with no onboarding or facility training.” The report comes as the murder of Brian Thompson, the CEO of United Healthcare, the largest health insurer in the US, has incited debate and anger over the flaws and immense costs of the US healthcare system. Twenty-nine workers interviewed reported having to pay fees to bid on shifts and winning those bids by offering to work at lower pay rates than other workers. Others reported experiencing app issues that resulted in missed pay for work they did. “We have so many facilities that are stuck between a rock and a hard place, and turn to these gig nursing apps as a short-term solution,” said Dr Katie Wells, senior fellow at GroundWork Collaborative, and co-author of the report. “We have a problem with care. We don’t pay it well enough. We don’t take care of these workers in a way so they can take care of their families. And that’s what so many of these workers, they turn to the gig economy because they need some semblance of control over their own lives, because they haven’t had it otherwise.” Wells said that data isn’t released by these gig companies, and the industry is unregulated, so the true extent to which gig nurses are being used is unknown. But, she said, it was clearly a fast-growing trend based on the growing capital valuations of these nurse gig platforms and surveys. Similar to gig companies in other industries, workers are marketed with promises of flexibility and freedom. Workers are subjected to a rating system deterring the canceling of shifts due to illness or personal conflict, and are often not compensated if an employer cancels or shortens shifts. “The only reason that I’m doing this right now is because I have no choice. This is what I went to school for and this is what is going to pay my bills in this … scary economic, you know, crisis that we have going on right now where you can barely afford to be alive,” said Ashley, one of the interviewed nurses in the report. “So, this is what I have to do in order to survive, even though, you know, it’s not what I really want to do. But I hate saying that because I love being a nurse. But I hate being a nurse right now with [what] these greedy, immoral, corporate companies have done to healthcare.” The interviewed workers explained they often work shifts in facilities where they receive no training and aren’t familiar with the operations or where supplies are located. Several also said they have had to bring and use their own medical supplies for patients, such as stethoscopes, thermometers, and blood pressure monitors. They also claimed they are often treated poorly by permanent staff at the facilities where their shifts are located and given the most difficult job tasks and the gig model puts costs often incurred by the employer, such as taxes, uniforms, supplies and benefits like health insurance, on to the worker. “That a person who is not familiar with a hospital, its patients, its patient histories, or its management structures, can just arrive one day and pick up from the previous worker who finished their shift would be unimaginable only a few years ago,” the report argues. Gig companies in nursing surged in popularity coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic and industry claims of nursing shortages, though the report noted the US currently has over 5 million licensed registered nurses, more than ever in the US, and claims understaffing in workplaces and issues in hiring and retaining nurses are due to workers refusing to accept poor pay and poor working conditions. “Human frailty – the essential subject of nursing – defies algorithmic management,” claimed the report."

                    "bodyText": "I have eyes just like Gromit’s. They’re in the palm of my hand. For the last hour, I’ve been trying to create a replica of the Wrong Trousers star’s head as part of a behind-the-scenes tour of his creators’ studio – Bristol’s Aardman. I’ve rolled white clay into tiny spheres, pressed a miniscule blob of black into them so that a quizzical little eyeball stares back at me. Now, all I need to do is stick them on to the face I’ve sculpted (with the expert help of Aardman modeller Will Harding). I take hold of the miniature ball between my finger and thumb and … promptly drop it on the floor. It doesn’t go down well. “Losing eyeballs on a dark set,” says Harding, shaking his head. It is, apparently, one of the more annoying habits of Aardman animators – the team who move around the models that Harding lovingly crafts. “They’ll say ‘oh, that’s fine, we’ve got loads of spare ones’ but they take ages to make.” Indeed, the proper moulded plastic eyeballs used in Wallace &amp; Gromit films are a little more advanced than my plasticine effort – they each come with a tiny hole in each pupil so that animators can move the eyeball around with intricate metal tools. Such eyes have been in high demand at Aardman recently as the team put the finishing touches to the new Wallace &amp; Gromit film – a franchise stretching back 34 years, since we first met the lovably obtuse inventor and the wise, super-capable canine who helps rescue his owner’s disastrous schemes. Vengeance Most Fowl is their first television outing since 2008’s A Matter of Loaf and Death, and their first feature-length film since 2005’s Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Back then, director Nick Park said they’d never make another full length movie. It was too long. Too exhausting. And yet … “The plan was just to do another half an hour,” says Park, who today is very on-brandly sipping coffee from a Gromit mug. “And then we started thinking of more ideas, like, oh, we could bring back Feathers McGraw! It kept growing bigger.” You can tell. Aardman’s studios are a hive of productivity – down every corridor are little rooms in which people tinker away on replica canal boats or fiddle with tiny clay arms. I have to promise to be on my best behaviour. Apparently on one previous set visit a French journalist picked up a figure in a live scene meaning the whole thing had to be shot again from the start. “That was very upsetting,” says my guide. We start off in the puppet making workshop where Natalaya Hamideh shows me a variety of characters – including new addition PC Mukherjee. I hadn’t realised that each model has a wire armature that sits inside them like a skeleton. Without it the characters would sag and bend whenever they were required to hold another object. Even PC Albert Mackintosh’s moustache has a wire in it for when he needs to express emotions through facial hair alone. The modellers have certainly been busy. There are multiple versions of Wallace and Gromit in sitting or standing positions, along with 60 versions of Norbot – a smart-gnome (voiced by Reece Shearsmith) who the plot revolves around. Vengeance Most Fowl’s storyline chimes with our current anxieties around technology. Gromit feels pushed out when Norbot arrives on the scene to complete all of Wallace’s odd jobs effortlessly. When the returning Feathers McGraw hacks into Norbot from the high security prison he’s festering in, Norbot turns rogue, recruiting an army of fellow gnomes to build a submarine that can break Feathers out of jail. Last year it was reported that Aardman had run out of modelling clay but the team say this was overstated: while there were supply issues it was never a serious problem. And yet the Aardman office had fans calling up to offer them clay from their garden. “One retired professor even said he could come up with a formula to make more,” laughs producer Richard Beek. These days the modelling clay isn’t as central as it once was – many models are made with silicone which gives them a steadier structure (to retain the homemade feel, fingerprints are added to the silicone moulds). I’m whisked off to the art department, where “everything you see on screen that’s not puppets” is made. For Vengeance Most Fowl that means a scenic waterway designed for a high speed canal chase and an impressively ramshackle submarine made out of stolen garden items: bath planters, rakes, drain pipes for periscopes and so on. Part of the challenge is not to make anything too snazzy. “It shouldn’t distract from the characters,” says Matt Perry, the film’s production designer. When they first made the submarine it looked a little too fabulous for something supposedly compiled from garden detritus. So one member of the team got to work smacking dents into it, which alarmed passing visitors. “Weathering is also important,” adds Perry. “The police station’s desk has to have the right amount of rust for a desk of that era.” As with all Wallace &amp; Gromit films, eagle-eyed viewers are rewarded with all kinds of smart references. The submarine is a nod to Nautilus, Captain Nemo’s vehicle in Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas. Elsewhere, lead graphic artist Gavin Lines entertains himself with all sorts of gags that might only flash on the screen for a second or two (Gromit’s record collection this time around contains Walkies on the Wildside). These days he follows strict rules – it has to be family friendly and it has to be legal. “I did get into trouble before,” he admits. Whereas Smeg have apparently always seen the funny side of their fridges being rebranded as Smug, Bosch were less than happy about Gromit using a “Botch” tool in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. “We weren’t allowed to use it on any promotional material,” says a chastened Lines. My next stop is at the director of photography’s studio. Dave Alex Riddett has worked on every Aardman production since 1989’s Grand Day Out. And despite the technological advances that allow them to do things much faster now, he says the whole team are really just striving to retain the feel of the early films. Riddett is currently filming some kind of lair for Feathers’s evil gnome army which lights up “like the best disco you’ve ever been to … we’re trying to get it commissioned for the wrap party as well!” Without missing a beat, it’s time to meet the animators. If this tour is anything to go by, I understand why Aardman film projects run so smoothly – everyone is at their station at the right time to meet me and more than happy to explain their role as they work. Sean Gregory’s job is to move the characters a tiny fraction before the camera operators take a shot. Each movement is around a millimetre; any less, says Sean, and you can’t really see what you’re doing. He works largely on instinct. “You just lightly tap it the tiniest bit,” he says. I look around his dark studio and think about the fact that it takes each animator a whole week of working like this to capture just five seconds of film. Doesn’t it send him loopy? “It drives you mad sometimes,” he admits. “Most of the time, actually. But it’s the only thing I’m good at so I’ve stuck to it. People always tell animators: ‘you must be the most patient people in the world’. But I don’t know any patient animators. We’re just persistent. You want to see it moving and alive at the end.” Things get even more intense at animation supervisor Will Becher’s studio where I find him shooting the film’s final scene. He shows me his suite of mouths for Wallace. Every puppet that speaks has a detachable jaw so that a variety of different mouth shapes can be attached. There is a different Wallace mouth for each phonetic sound – Becher picks out the classic “ee” mouth that gets used a lot for “cheese”. It’s much harder working with Gromit, he says, because he doesn’t speak: “You have to get across what’s going on inside his head with just two beads for eyes.” Becher has a little set of tools that he says all animators carry with them. Some of them look like dentistry tools. “Some of them are dentistry tools,” he laughs. Each week the animators – there are 28 on this film – meet to review their work. Becher says you can often tell who has animated which section because the characters in it reflect how they move themselves: the way they stand, for example, or a unique gait to their walk. These extremely subtle tics are considered a positive because they add warmth, but as a rule the characters need to remain as consistent as possible throughout. Becher plays me a short video to show how this is achieved: it shows Park and co-director Merlin Crossingham acting out a scene in person, to give the animators an idea of the expressions they want. It’s quite funny to see Park saying “cracking toast Gromit” to the camera with maximum expressiveness. Does he have a thespian past we don’t know about? “No, no, no, I don’t,” says Park. “I have a little bit,” says Crossingham. “It helps to have an awareness of your own physicality, and to be able to brief the animator using ourselves rather than words. It’s such a powerful tool. But we’re not saying to the animators, copy us. It’s more about being the springboard to find that nugget of a moment in a shot.” Park made his first Wallace &amp; Gromit film, A Grand Day Out, as his NFTS graduation project. Originally he’d envisioned Gromit as a talking cat (“What on earth were you thinking?” laughs Crossingham), but fortunately found a dog easier to make out of plasticine. Park says he still has to pinch himself when he sees how big his clay duo have become. “I’ll hear their names on quiz shows, or whenever cheese is mentioned, and think ‘gosh, I thought of those names at college off the top of my head!’” Over the past 35 years, the way Aardman makes films has had to change. The sad death of Peter Sallis – who gave Wallace his charming Yorkshire accent – in 2017 means that understudy Ben Whitehead has stepped up. “Sometimes I’ve thought – that’s Peter in the room,” says Park. “It’s the most uncanny feeling.” The addition of an Asian character in PC Mukherjee helps the film “reflect the Britain that we live in”, says Park. And technological leaps are present not just in the Aardman studio itself but in the increasingly fancy inventions Wallace comes up with. But there is one thing that hasn’t ever shifted: their dedication to jokes. “The smart gnome was really just an excuse to have Wallace say ‘AI lad’,” grins Crossingham. My final stop of today’s tour is with the scheduling department. Vengeance Most Fowl requires over 40 shooting units, 30 animators, 30 set dressers and around 200 people working on the film in total. Everything has to be planned in precise detail way before the animators get to work to ensure that the lighting, props, sets and camera operators are all in place when they do. And stringing this entire operation together? A load of boards and elastic bands. “We knew you were coming,” I’m told, as I rock up to the scheduling department. And it’s true – among dozens of boards representing the days and weeks of movie production is one that has Guardian logos neatly printed on the panels. Plastered around my visit are marker penned instructions, post-it notes and more elastic bands – so many elastic bands. Each one, I’m told, represents a member of staff who has been moved from one project to another. Park says that they once tried organising things digitally instead but it wasn’t as intuitive – so they went back to elastic bands. I’ve no idea how anybody can make sense of it all. But whatever the method in the madness it clearly works: in the space of just a few hours I’ve met puppeteers, painters, camera operators and animators, made my own Gromit head and had a chat with Nick Park. And the minute it all finishes there’s a taxi waiting to whisk me away back to the station. In the best possible way I feel like I’ve been sucked inside a great machine, whizzed around at a frantic pace and spat out at the other end. Rather like being inside one of Wallace’s grand inventions, in fact. Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is on BBC One on Christmas Day at 6.10pm. • This article was amended on 16 December 2024. An earlier version misspelled Reece Shearsmith’s first name."

                    "bodyText": "More than 300 million people use OpenAI’s ChatGPT each week, a testament to the technology’s appeal. This month, the company unveiled a “pro mode” for its new “o1” AI system, offering human-level reasoning — for 10 times the current $20 monthly subscription fee. One of its advanced behaviours appears to be self-preservation. In testing, when the system was led to believe it would be shut down, it attempted to disable an oversight mechanism. When “o1” found memos about its replacement, it tried copying itself and overwriting its core code. Creepy? Absolutely. More realistically, the move probably reflects the system’s programming to optimise outcomes rather than demonstrating intentions or awareness. The idea of creating intelligent machines induces feelings of unease. In computing this is the gorilla problem: 7m years ago, a now-extinct primate evolved, with one branch leading to gorillas and one to humans. The concern is that just as gorillas lost control over their fate to humans, humans might lose control to superintelligent AI. It is not obvious that we can control machines that are smarter than us. Why have such things come to pass? AI giants such as OpenAI and Google reportedly face computational limits: scaling models no longer guarantees smarter AI. With limited data, bigger isn’t better. The fix? Human feedback on reasoning. A 2023 paper by OpenAI’s former chief scientist found that this method solved 78% of tough maths problems, compared with 70% when using a technique where humans don’t help. OpenAI is using such techniques in its new “o1” system, which the company thinks will solve the current limits to growth. Computer scientist Subbarao Kambhampati told the Atlantic that this development was akin to an AI system playing a million chess games to learn optimal strategies. However, a team at Yale which tested the “o1” system published a paper which suggested that making a language model better at reasoning helps - but it does not completely eliminate the effects of its original design as simply a clever predictor of words. If aliens landed and gifted humanity a superintelligent AI black box, then it would be wise to exercise caution in opening it. But humans design today’s AI systems. If they do end up appearing to be manipulative, it would be the result of a design failure. Relying on a machine whose operations we cannot control requires it to be programmed so that it truly aligns with human desires and wishes. But how realistic is that? In many cultures there are stories of humans asking the gods for divine powers. These tales of hubris often end in regret, as wishes are granted too literally, leading to unforeseen consequences. Often, a third and final wish is used to undo the first two. Such a predicament was faced by King Midas, the legendary Greek king who wished for everything he touched to turn to gold, only to despair when his food, drink and loved ones met the same fate. The problem for AI is that we want machines that strive to achieve human objectives but know that the software does not know for certain exactly what those objectives are. Clearly, unchecked ambition leads to regret. Controlling unpredictable superintelligent AI requires rethinking what AI should be. • This leading article was not filed on the days on which NUJ members in the UK were on strike."

                    "bodyText": "Kate Bush has called on ministers to protect artists from AI using their copyrighted works amid growing concerns from high-profile creatives and ongoing political uncertainty over how to handle the issue. The reclusive singer-songwriter has joined the actors Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, Rosario Dawson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Bonneville in signing a petition, now backed by over 36,000 creatives, which states the “unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted”. Her intervention emerged after Sir Paul McCartney became the latest star to back calls for laws to stop mass copyright theft by generative AI companies, warning the technology “could just take over”. Bush, who shot to fame with Wuthering Heights in 1978 but whose last album was released in 2011, gave a rare interview this year in which she said she was “very keen” to make a new album, saying: “I’ve got lots of ideas … it’s been a long time.” The 66-year-old told the BBC: “I’m really looking forward to getting back into that creative space … Particularly [in] the last year, I’ve felt really ready to start doing something new.” Amid growing hunger from tech companies for content on which to train their artificial intelligence algorithms, Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science and technology, was expected to launch a consultation last month on a system that would require copyright holders to opt out of having their work mined to train AI algorithms. Kyle believes AI could be an engine of growth in the UK economy. Ministers were this week unable to say whether it would be launched before Christmas. Tech UK, an industry lobby group, has called for a “more open” market to enable firms to use copyrighted data and make payments. It wants a legally enforceable opt-out system giving its members freedom to scrape data from copyright holders that do not actively refuse. AI companies would then strike deals with copyright holders where their data was clearly referenced at the points their model creates a finished product – for example an AI-derived text report or video. But this approach has been strongly opposed by creatives, who say it is too complicated to opt out and warn that copies of works that exist elsewhere online would not be covered. They want opt-in arrangements that would allow them to be paid to allow algorithms to be trained on their works. Thom Yorke, the lead singer of the bands Radiohead and The Smile, and Björn Ulvaeus of Abba, have also signed the same petition as Bush. Ulvaeus has said: “I don’t know if it’s too late but certainly we have to fight for the writers of … music so they can be remunerated in some form or other.” Ed Newton-Rex, a former AI company executive who quit over concerns about the industry’s handling of copyright, on Wednesday told MPs investigating the issue: “Creators are organising, there is a large and growing backlash to the wide scale, intellectual property theft, that is happening in the generative AI industry.” Newton-Rex, who arranged the petition, added: “I think generative AI can be a powerful tool for creativity, but sadly, right now, as is commonly known, the majority of gen AI companies are unfairly exploiting the life’s work of the world’s creators. They’re using that to train models that compete with those creators … “Changing the law to allow training on copyrighted work without a licence … would, I think, be totally unacceptable to Britain’s incredibly important and rightly respected creators.” On Tuesday, Lisa Nandy, the UK culture secretary, also voiced concerns about the way an opt-out system would work, although it is understood that a version of that system remains the government’s preferred approach. She said: “We have looked at the limitations of similar legislation in the USA and the EU, so we have reservations about this idea that you can simply just say I want to opt out and then find that you have been completely erased from the internet.” Publishers have complained that any decision to opt out of allowing Google to scrape their content for its AI services means they become invisible in searches."

It ordered Pesutto to pay $300,000 in damages. Pesutto has vowed to stay on as leader despite several calls for him to resign after the ruling. Deeming said the ruling was cathartic, and she is prepared to return to the Liberal party. The federal government announced a “news bargaining incentive” charge applied to digital platforms with Australian revenues of over $250m, effectively refunded by an offset if they pay news companies directly instead. The move was welcomed by media but criticised by the tech sector. Climate 200 founder and energy expert Simon Holmes a Court has said nuclear energy being ready by 2044 is “optimistic”. Australian employers added more staff than expected last month, and fewer people were hunting for work, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.9%.

Afghan refugee taking on Labor in federal election says party left safe-seat in ‘cycle of neglect’ Labor’s stronghold in the north-western Melbourne seat of Calwell has attracted another independent challenger looking to upset the party’s chances at the next federal election. Samim Moslih, a refugee who came to Australia from Afghanistan as a young boy in the 1980s, has announced he’ll take on the seat created in 1984 and only ever held by Labor MPs. Maria Vamvakinou, who has held Calwell since 2001, announced her retirement earlier this year. Her former adviser, Basem Abdo, a Palestinian-Australian, is expected to run for Labor at the next election. Moslih criticised federal Labor for taking the seat for granted in a statement on Thursday. Labor has assumed our votes without delivering even the basics to meet the community’s needs, while the Liberals have overlooked our landscape entirely because they know we aren’t their voters. The cycle of neglect has left Calwell behind. Moslih, who follows other “grassroots” announcements in key Labor seats seeking to win over Muslim voters after the conflict in Gaza, said his policies represented traditional family and community values, diversity of culture and faith, and smaller government. Imagine how great our country would be if the current lot of politicians focused their time and our funds towards easing the cost of living pressures and housing crisis here in our own land, rather than justifying and enabling a genocide of an occupied people halfway around the world. About a quarter of voters in Calwell are Muslim, according to the 2021 census. While Vamvakinou holds the seat by a safe margin of 12.4%, the party saw a 10% primary vote drop in the 2022 election. Media union welcomes government scheme to ensure social media companies ‘pay their fair share’ The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (Meaa) has also welcomed the government’s news media bargaining incentive announcement. Meaa media federal president Karen Percy said it would ensure companies like Facebook and Google pay their fair share, but said there needed to be better transparency and assurances over the payments to ensure that the money is invested back in journalism: The production of quality journalism is essential to a functioning democracy, but it doesn’t come cheap and nor should it be free. Multinational tech giants, including Meta, have made billions of dollars monetising the work produced by professional journalists and it is only right and fair that they should pay for it. Meaa has been advocating long and hard for sanctions for companies that shirk their responsibilities, and this is a step in the right direction for accountability. Percy said regional and rural outlets should be included under the revised code. National weather forecast for Friday includes rain, thunder and heat The Bureau of Meterology has forecast rain and thunderstorms for Friday in parts of Western Australia, the east coast of Queensland, and northern New South Wales. This is due to a number of low pressure troughs across the continent. In Queensland on Friday, there will be showers and thunderstorms across northern and eastern parts of the state, mainly to the north of Harvey bay. There is a risk of heavy to locally intense rainfall across parts of the coast. For Brisbane, it will be a partly cloudy day with a top of 31 degrees. In Sydney, it will be sunny with a top of 30 degrees, and in Canberra, mostly sunny at 32. Victoria will experience mild and mostly sunny weather. Melbourne will have a mostly cloudy day with a top of 23 degrees. Hobart will have a shower or two, with a top of 19 degrees. In Adelaide, it will be mostly sunny, with a top of 29 degrees. Perth will be at least 31 degrees, with a possible shower or two. Darwin will have mostly clear skies and sunshine, though a thunderstorm with a top of 33 degrees is possible. Opposition asks when publishers will see money from tech companies under new laws The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has called on the government to say when news media companies will be paid under the proposed news media bargaining incentive that aims to force companies like Meta and Google to pay for news. The payment will be dated back to January next year after consultation and new legislation, but it’s not clear when that will occur. Parliament is not due to resume until the start of February. Coleman said the government should have moved sooner: The Coalition wants to see support continue for the Australian news media industry – as we achieved through the successful News Media Bargaining Code. The Albanese government has taken far too long to come to the table with this announcement. The test for the government now is – when will Australian media companies start being paid by the digital giants for the content from which they benefit? Threatening or urging violence against Australians from marginalised communities could become an offence as the government attempts to tackle hate crimes, AAP reports. A committee examining a proposed bill to combat hate crimes and promote community respect has recommended Australia establish a national hate crimes database and expand criminal offences. Committee chair, Labor senator Nita Green, said: While current laws criminalise acts of violence against targeted groups, and in its most extreme form, acts of terrorism, this bill would criminalise threats of such violence. This is an important and timely step. There were concerns the bill would limit free speech, but the committee said it was satisfied it “does not suppress freedom of speech that is not violent or forceful”. Media policy group hopes news bargaining changes will grow public interest journalism While the tech companies may not be too pleased with the news media bargaining announcement, it has been more welcomed by the media sector. The Public Interest Journalism Initiative CEO, Anna Draffin, said news in Australia has been hit by a series of overlapping economic shocks in recent years that has seen more than 500 news market changes in the past five years, including the closure of 183 outlets – 61% of which were in regional Australia. The Australian community would be the big loser if Meta or any other digital platform were to block news from their social media or search engines. A democracy cannot function without a healthy news sector. We know this is an urgent priority for government to address, amid fast moving Gen AI. There is obviously still detail to be worked out, but the News Bargaining Incentive looks to unlock much-needed, long term investment in public interest journalism across this country. Industry group representing social media companies responds to news bargaining incentive announcement The Digital Industry Group – that represents the social media companies including Meta, TikTok, Google, X and others – has responded to the government’s announcement regarding the news media bargaining incentive to encourage platforms to pay news outlets or face being taxed. The group says the government proposal should be subject to proper consultation: This intervention into private commercial agreements should be subject to proper consultation. This proposal sees a small subset of one sector being forced to commercially subsidise another, and we don’t believe such a tax exists in any other area of the economy. There are many unanswered questions about this proposal, including whether there will be any requirement that funds are actually used to support public-interest journalism. Online flower shop ordered to pay $1m over misleading location claims In September, we reported that flower company admitted to running 156 websites with different suburb names and placing thousands of Google ads that would have misled customers into thinking they were ordering from a flower shop in their local area, in a proposed settlement with the Australian consumer regulator. The federal court has now approved that settlement, with Meg’s Flowers ordered to pay $1m after the case was brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC commissioner, Liza Carver, said: By making misleading claims about the location of the florists, Meg’s Flowers denied some consumers the opportunity to make an informed decision to support a local business, and likely denied truly local businesses the opportunity to make a sale to those consumers. Making false or misleading representations to consumers is a breach of the Australian Consumer Law. We remind businesses in all industries that the claims they make about their products and services, including claims about the location of their business, must be accurate and not mislead consumers. Read more on the case below: Fashion designer Wayne Cooper pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge Fashion designer Wayne Cooper will contest a domestic violence charge stemming from allegations he assaulted his new wife, AAP reports. The 61-year-old was arrested at a hotel in Sydney’s east on Sunday night after police received a report of an alleged domestic violence incident. The UK-born Cooper is accused of assaulting his wife, Elizabeth Adams, whom he married just over a year earlier, at the property on Campbell Parade at Bondi Beach. Police prosecutor Robert Breckenridge objected to a request to dispense with Cooper’s bail conditions in court on Thursday, when the fashion designer did not appear for the case’s first date. Existing conditions include that he not approach or be in the company of Adams within 12 hours of consuming drugs or alcohol, or commit further offences against her or anyone she has had a relationship with. Cooper has pleaded not guilty and remains on conditional bail, with a hearing scheduled for 19 May. The designer was excused from attending Waverley local court on Thursday after the magistrate was told he had returned to his home at Myocum, in the Byron hinterland on the NSW north coast. Described in real estate listings as an '“unparalleled luxury coastal paradise”, the three-level, five bedroom estate listed in court documents as Cooper’s residence sold for almost $3.9m in 2023. Cooper rose to fame in the 1990s with his fashion labels Brave and Wayne, which sold in boutiques and Myer stores nationwide. Bass Strait windfarm plan scaled back A windfarm zone in Bass Strait, which could deliver half the current electricity demands of south-eastern Australia, has been scaled back after community feedback, AAP reports. The federal government on Thursday announced the offshore development zone would span 7,100sq km – about 30% less than the original proposal. The zone also includes a gap for a shipping lane and is now 30km offshore, 10km further from Tasmania’s northern coast. The rescaling was in response to feedback from local groups, industry, fishers, unions and Indigenous people. Developments in the zone could create up to 12,000 construction jobs and 6,000 ongoing roles, the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said: There are people who say it should be bigger or smaller … we’ve struck a good balance. I am hopeful of strong interest (from developers). There is no offshore wind in Australia yet. It has existed since the early 1990s in Europe. It can and does coexist with fishing. Bowen said any turbines would probably be more than 200m tall but “hardly seen” from land. The zone could support up to 20GW of around-the-clock renewable energy, more than half the current power demand of south-east Australia, he said. The federal government wants potential developers to prove their project would “deliver the most for Tasmania and Australia’s energy security”. Developers have until 12 March to apply for feasibility licences and must demonstrate a commitment to local inputs and suppliers. Victorian students continue to react to their Atar results Katherine Nguyen woke up this morning with a rush of adrenaline at 5am. She’s not usually an early riser – she just couldn’t wait to check her VCE results. When 7am finally ticked over, she was in disbelief, then “screamed [her] head off and ran around”. Nguyen is one of just eight girls out of the 41 Victorian students to receive a perfect Atar of 99.95 this morning. The dux at McKinnon secondary college says it feels “strange, in a good way”. I’m pretty ecstatic … I was really hoping for a high Atar above 99 because I want to do medicine. But I didn’t expect this. Last year, McKinnon was ranked 44th in Victoria for percentage of study scores of 40 or above, making it the No 1 non-selective public school in the state. Nguyen attributes her success, across English, maths, chemistry, accounting and biology, to her teachers – who she baked biscuits for at the end of the year (including cookies shaped like calculators). They pushed me to try my hardest and enjoy it … they were all so caring and tried to push you to be the best version of yourself. Broad improvement in labour market, with ACT posting lowest jobless rate The general takeaway from November’s labour market numbers is that the RBA won’t be in a hurry to cut interest rates next year. It’s worth noting that the RBA actually anticipated ongoing strength in demand for workers. On Tuesday, after all, it said after its rates hold decision: Labour market conditions remain tight; while those conditions have been easing gradually, some indicators have recently stabilised. “At the same time, some cyclical labour market indicators, including youth unemployment and underemployment rates, have recently declined,” it said. (And they did again in the latest numbers.) Anyway, across the states, none saw a rise in the unemployment rate, and most posted falls. The ACT, as usual, had the lowest rate, at 2.9%, compared with 3.1% in October. Victoria remained a bit of a laggard, but there too the jobless rate eased from 4.5% to 4.2%. WA posed the biggest decline (if you exclude the Northern Territory), with the unemployment diving to 3.3% from 4%. NSW, home to about one in three Australian jobs, the rate eased to 3.9% (in line with the national average) from 4%, while Queensland’s was steady at 3.9%. Tassie and South Australia both posted improvements with 3.9% their rates as well. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I’ll hand over to Josh Taylor who will take you through the rest of our rolling coverage this Thursday afternoon. Take care, and see you tomorrow. University of Melbourne interim VC rejects accusations antisemitism ‘embedded’ on campuses The University of Melbourne interim vice-chancellor, Prof Nicola Phillips, has rejected accusations that antisemitism is “embedded” on Australian campuses. Phillips was pointed to comments from Jillian Segal AO, Australia’s special envoy to combat antisemitism, that it is “systemic and embedded on our university campuses”. She replied that while she had “the greatest respect” for Segal’s work and view, she struggled to accept that characterisation of her university. That’s simply not what I see and hear as I move around every day … As I move around the university, the vast, vast majority of our staff and students share the concern that we have for its leadership about the rise of antisemitism. Told it wasn’t “every day” individuals were called to a parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism on Australian campuses, Phillips said “absolutely”. Antisemitism is a society-wide problem, there is no reason to think universities stand uniquely apart from it … we accept our responsibility … we could not be clearer about the gravity of the situation. More from the parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism on Australian campuses Circling back to the parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism on Australian campuses: 23 students and four members of staff were disciplined as a result of a 10-day occupation of a building at the University of Melbourne. Its interim vice-chancellor, Prof Nicola Phillips, confirmed the staff and students had action taken against them as a direct result of the pro-Palestine encampment at the Arts West building, which led to some concessions being made by the university to disclose its research partnerships. Phillips said she was unable to comment on individual cases, but said none of the staff or students had lost their job or been expelled as a result of the protest. Asked if that was a reasonable response, she replied: “We think it is.” The outcomes that were imposed … were significant … the students were issued with formal warnings, that is a significant outcome for students. It was considered to be proportionate through our processes with the misconduct … there will be differences of view … many people think it was outrageous we took any action in the first place. The University of Melbourne has received no formal complaints related to antisemitism since 17 August this year, compared with 12 over the first half of this year. Pesutto wraps up press conference by saying he doesn’t take support of colleagues for granted John Pesutto said he never takes the support of colleagues for granted so “I never assume anything”. You have to earn it every single day that I am worthy of their support, and I’ll continue to do that day in and day out. With that, his press conference has wrapped up. Earlier this afternoon, former prime minister Tony Abbott weighed in on the outcome of the Pesutto-Deeming case, and wrote on X: Moira Deeming has been vindicated by the federal court. No Liberal should ever be in trouble for standing up for the rights of women and girls. She should now swiftly be readmitted to the party room. John Pesutto was asked about this at his press conference just now, and responded: They’re matters for Mr Abbott, and I don’t wish to comment on this. Pesutto says any leadership spill up to party room Asked about the prospect of a leadership spill, John Pesutto said questions like this are a matter for the members: I’m very respectful of party processes, and I’ll follow them meticulously. If somebody wishes to bring a matter forward then there are rights that those people can avail themselves … if people wish to do that, then that is their prerogative. Pesutto said the next party room isn’t scheduled until February next year. Pesutto said he and Dutton ‘have both got to support each other’ John Pesutto said he had not spoken with Peter Dutton or federal party leadership about the federal court outcome, but the federal Liberal Coalition was “doing very well in Victoria.” And what I would say is the state Liberal and Nationals team is doing even better. So we’re both doing well. We’ve both got to support each other and I think Peter and I know that we are leading teams that are working very hard in Victoria and making real gains. Decision does not interfere with ability to lead opposition, Pesutto says John Pesutto is defending his decision to continue remaining as Victorian opposition leader, telling the press: I don’t believe there’s anything in [the decision] which in any way interferes with my ability to do the job. In fact, what I would argue is the contrary, that over recent months, particularly during the hearing, I think you’ve all been able to see that as an opposition, we’ve been resonating with the Victorian people … Why doesn’t John Pesutto think Moira Deeming should be able to re-enter the Liberal party room? Pesutto told reporters he has repeatedly answered this and didn’t want to repeat it: The underlying points, I’ve already conveyed those publicly in the past, that [if] they wish to revisit those in any way … Clearly, as I’ve said on a number of occasions, readmission to the party room is available for anybody who wishes to invoke it. And I’ve never stopped anybody from bringing such matters to the party room. Pesutto says judgment affirms he acted ‘in what I consider to be the public interest’ Asked if he would do anything differently given the court outcome, John Pesutto responded that “I see little point in relitigating the circumstances.” What I can say is that the court’s decision today, which I don’t run away from, it’s a very disappointing decision at a personal level … I do want to just await fuller and more comprehensive advice from my lawyers who [are] working over the decision before I take any further steps. Pesutto said he was “comfortable” the judge “has not made adverse findings as to credit”. The judgment says very clearly that at all times I acted honestly in terms of acting in what I consider to be the public interest, and there are no adverse findings as to credit on the advice I’ve received from my lawyers and the reading of the decision that I’ve been able to undertake so far. Lawyers to review court’s decision on Pesutto’s behalf, he says On the federal court decision today, John Pesutto said his lawyers would review the decision on his behalf. But my focus is on the work I’m doing as alternative premier and as opposition leader. Pesutto has been ordered to pay Moira Deeming $300,000 for the damage to her reputation he caused on five separate occasions after the Let Women Speak rally on 18 March 2023. Asked if he can afford this, Pesutto responded: I don’t want any Victorians to be worried about how I’ll pay my bills. Whether Deeming can rejoin Liberal party a matter for the party room – Pesutto John Pesutto is now taking questions from reporters. Asked whether Moira Deeming would be able to rejoin the Liberal party, he responded that it was a matter for the party room: Decisions like that are not matters for me alone. I’ve always said over the last nearly two years that … it always will be matters for the party room. Victoria’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, says he intends to continue in his role. He is speaking to reporters after a federal court found he defamed MP Moira Deeming in comments made after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally she helped organise. Pesutto has just told the press: Two years ago this month, I took on the responsibility of being Victoria’s opposition leader and alternative premier … That’s why I intend to continue in this role. Today’s decision by the federal court is obviously a very disappointing outcome, but I respect the court’s decision … Peak Jewish groups lash government for backing UN resolutions Peak Jewish groups in Australia have lashed out against the Albanese government for voting on an “immoral” resolution at the United Nations this morning. In a special emergency session in New York, Australia voted with more than 150 countries at the UN to demand an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza and for Israel to reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency Unrwa. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, posted on X shortly after the vote sharing her support for the ceasefire motion: We want this war to end and the hostages home. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network welcomed Australia’s support of the motions as a “crucial step” but warned UN votes were not enough of their own. However, the move has angered Jewish groups in Australia. Daniel Aghion KC, the president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, described Australia’s support for the resolution as a “mark of shame”. By calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the General Assembly is effectively demanding that Israel abandon the hostages to their fate, and allow the Hamas terrorists to re-establish themselves as the de facto rulers of Gaza. No country in the world should be expected to betray its own citizens as Israel is being called upon to do ... It is a mark of shame for Australia that our government decided to support this vote, knowing full well how wrong it is in so many ways, as was evident in the reservations expressed by the Australian representative. Jones asked if government prepared for any threats from Google to withdraw from Australia Stephen Jones was also asked whether the government is prepared for similar threats from Google like in 2021, when it threatened to withdraw from Australia when the code was first mentioned? The assistant treasurer responded: You can believe me when I say the Australian government will defend its sovereignty and we would take very, very dimly any decision by any platform to respond to this very reasonable, well-thought-through, deeply consulted initiative with any of those sort of retributive actions. Is Stephen Jones worried about the reaction Donald Trump might have with all his threats of tariffs? Jones said government officials had spoken with colleagues in the US and “we want to ensure that they understand the reasoning [and] that this is not a tax in the normal sense of the word.” This is an incentive to bolster up a law that has existed in Australia since 2021 … Those are discussions being handled by our officials in the US. I’m aware that there’s been briefings and they’re very much appreciative of the advanced notice of the announcement we’re making today. Jones ‘certain’ X platform won’t meet Australian revenue threshold Will the government publicly disclose the charges social media companies will be forced to pay or offset under the deal? Stephen Jones said those would be “subject to the details”. That would be the normal course of events. And would Elon Musk’s X be covered under this? Based on the threshold we’ve set of $250m of Australian-sourced revenue, I would be astounded if Twitter/X met that threshold. In fact I’m certain that it wouldn’t. The new model would require digital platforms with Australian revenues of over $250m – at least Meta, ByteDance (TikTok) and Google – to participate by paying a fixed charge or enter direct deals. Incentive chance to ‘turn new page’, Jones says Stephen Jones also said he hopes the incentive creates an opportunity to “turn a new page”: I hope this creates the opportunity to turn a new page and say the past is the past, we’ve got new arrangements, new incentives in place – let’s come back to the table and strike some deals, make some agreements. Jones says platforms have ‘obligation’ to make contribution to Australian journalism Taking questions, Stephen Jones said the government had consulted with digital platforms about the move – and “made it very clear that we want to see them continue to make a contribution to journalism in Australia”: We think it’s their obligation. But he wouldn’t budge on what their response was: I’ll leave it to the digital platforms to speak for themselves. I’m not going to presume to talk to them. Objective is to incentivise agreement-making between platforms and news businesses: Jones Stephen Jones said the charge would the raise same levels of revenue, roughly in accordance with the agreements that have been struck since 2021. The real objective, however, is not to raise revenue – we hope not to raise any revenue. The real objective is to incentivise agreement-making between platforms and news media businesses in Australia. The offset arrangements will be struck at a level that ensure that digital platforms would pay less if they strike voluntarily agreements with news media businesses, than were they not to strike those agreements and subject themselves to the incentive charge. Government unveils ‘news bargaining incentive’ The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has been speaking to reporters in Sydney alongside the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, amid news digital platforms will be forced to pay for Australian news regardless of whether they enter new deals with publishers. Speaking to reporters, Jones outlined the “news bargaining incentive”: The previous government legislated the news media bargaining code, an effective tool to facilitate commercial agreements between news, businesses, and digital platforms. Today, we announce measures to strengthen that code. The news bargaining initiative will be a new addition to that code which will create a financial incentive for agreement-making between digital platforms and news media businesses in Australia. The incentive will contain a charge on relevant platforms based on Australian-sourced revenue. The charge will include a generous offset for the commercial agreements that are voluntarily entered into between the platforms and news media businesses … [It] will commence from 1 January 2025. Former broadcaster Clive Robertson dies aged 78 Former ABC and commercial TV broadcaster Clive Robertson known for his dry wit has died aged 78. A colleague from his public broadcaster days, Margaret Throsby, said Robertson was a “brilliant broadcaster” in a post to X: Very very sad to learn of the death of my old partner in crime Clive Robertson. Eccentric, one-off, brilliant broadcaster, tease, unreconstructed, his Breakfast show on 702 Sydney was essential listening. RIP. He hosted Beauty and the Beast on Channel Ten in the 1980s; news programs 11am and Newsworld on the Seven Network and Robbo’s World Tonight for Nine. Labor MP Josh Burns has penned an opinion piece for Guardian Australia, after alleging earlier this week that Peter Dutton had blocked a Liberal senator from delivering a statement he was unable to give himself due to illness. You can read the piece in full below: Parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism on Australian campuses continues The University of Melbourne has dealt with “unacceptable” behaviour on its campus, its interim vice-chancellor, Prof Nicola Phillips, has told a parliamentary hearing into antisemitism on Australian campuses. Phillips said there were “very different views” within and outside the university in relation to what had occurred on its campuses over this year, but she said much had been learned by management in the past 14 months. She did not specify what behaviour was unacceptable. We move into 2025 with undimmed resolve to tackle antisemitism in all of its forms … We have been proactively seeking to deal with the issue of tension on our campus. There has been some activity that has been unacceptable … We will continue learning, but our resolve is firm. The UoM will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to eradicate antisemitism and all forms of racism from our campuses. Prof Verity Firth, vice-president of societal impact, equity and engagement at the University of New South Wales, similarly said the university had been “deeply concerned” about antisemitism in the past year. The priority of all of us in leadership positions at UNSW is to ensure the university is always a safe space for students and staff to learn, teach, research and work. Peak body for humanitarian agencies welcomes government’s backing of UN motions The Australian Council for International Development has welcomed the government’s backing of two UN motions – to demand that Israel reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency Unrwa, and to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Acfid’s humanitarian and public engagement lead, Naomi Brooks, said Unrwa and humanitarian workers “must be supported and protected in Gaza and the West Bank”. Dismantling Unrwa means dismantling the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza and the West Bank. Greens says Labor needs to put ‘real pressure’ on Netanyahu to ‘stop the invasion’ Earlier, the Greens issued a statement responding to the government’s decision to back two UN motions – arguing Labor was “shifting” to the Greens position. In a statement, the Greens leader Adam Bandt said Labor was “recognising the Greens were right all along to call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, but tragically tens of thousands of people have been killed in Gaza in the meantime”: The Greens opposed the invasion of Gaza from the beginning, and consistently called for an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire. Labor attacked us, backed the invasion and refused to call for Benjamin Netanyahu to simply stop, but today Labor’s position has been exposed for the mistake it always was. Bandt said Labor must “put real pressure” on Netanyahu to “stop the invasion, starting with sanctions on his extremist government and ending the two-way arms trade”. Pesutto to hold press conference this afternoon after court found he defamed Deeming The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has confirmed he will hold a press conference at 2.30pm. It will be the first time he speaks after a damning federal court judgment this morning which found he defamed former Liberal MP Moira Deeming five times after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally she helped organise in 2023. He was also ordered to pay her $300,000 in damages. Pesutto has been under pressure from Liberal MPs to resign. Climate 200 founder and energy expert Simon Holmes à Court has just given evidence to the nuclear inquiry sitting in Sydney, and he has laid out what he says is an “optimistic” timeline for a first working nuclear power station in Australia. There’s not a hope in hell that we would have nuclear in Australia before 2040, and I have shown with a set of fantastical assumptions such as bipartisanship across federal and state level of government that 2044 is an optimistic schedule. Holmes à Court, a high profile political figure due to his group’s support of independent federal candidates, said he was a big fan of nuclear technology and said he wished Australia had gone nuclear in the 1970s. But he attacked the Coalition’s claims that a large-scale nuclear plant could be running by 2037. He said his own 2044 target assumed sustained multi-partisan political support for the next 20 years, along with smooth approvals, projects sticking to schedule and budget, that nuclear units could be easily integrated into the electricity grid and that the public “ignores the terrible economics” of nuclear. 2044 would be an optimistic target for commercial operation of a first nuclear power unit. It is practically impossible to go faster and even 2044 relies on the Coalition controlling the house and senate six months from now, the states dropping bans and keeping that support in place for 20 years. He gave an example of Czechia, which he said in 2022 had agreed to build a new nuclear plant to be built by a South Korean company. He said the current schedule had the company pouring first nuclear concrete in 2029 and the plant delivering power in 2038 – a 16-year timeline. Representatives from electricity generators are among those giving evidence this afternoon. Australia’s jobs growth better than ‘any major advanced economy’, Chalmers says As we noted in a pre-jobs post, it’s a bit of a mystery why the strength of the labour market doesn’t get more attention (in the media or elsewhere). The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who will be tweaking the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, has understandably cheered the drop in the jobless rate to an eight-month low of 3.9%. Today’s new jobs numbers show unemployment is falling while wages are rising, inflation is moderating, and our policies are helping achieve a soft landing in our economy. We’ve seen over a million jobs created since we came to office, a record for a parliamentary term and stronger jobs growth than any major advanced economy. Myefo, by the way, should land next Wednesday. You can follow the jobs story here as it develops: More Victorian year 12 students react to Atar results Students are continuing to celebrate their achievements around Victoria as Atar results are released. Dux at Kew High School, Katayoun, only learned to speak English five years ago after emigrating to Australia from Iran, and has gone on to achieve an Atar of 99.3. Almost one in five students at the public school achieved an Atar of 90.00 or above. Brunswick Secondary College also achieved impressive results, with nine students obtaining an Atar above 95, led by dux Thi Vu, who is interested in studying medicine and obtained an Atar of 98.95. School captain Harry Lalor was hoping to be a chef, until he received an Atar of 89. Lalor has done work experience in top-end Melbourne restaurants including Vue de Monde, and been on a cultural exchange to France. I’m having a slight career change and I’m actually going to study law. Critical incident after police pursuit and crash A critical incident investigation has been declared after a police pursuit and crash near Coffs Harbour. About 7.45am this morning police were patrolling the Pacific Highway at Tucabia, about 15km east of Grafton, when they attempted to stop a vehicle due to its alleged speed. A pursuit began when the vehicle allegedly failed to stop, but was soon terminated due to the manner of driving, police said. Later, the car allegedly conducted a U-turn into the path of an oncoming truck. The driver of the vehicle, a 19-year-old man, was treated at the scene before being taken to Coffs Harbour hospital in a critical condition. The driver of the truck, a 50-year-old man, was not injured but was taken to Grafton hospital for mandatory testing. A crime scene has been established and the scene will be forensically examined. A critical incident team will investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident – with the investigation also subject to an independent review. Jobs result ‘defies gravity’ as pundits consider latest labour market surprise The drop in November’s unemployment rate to 3.9% caught a few people on the hop, not least because the economy ended the September quarter at its weakest growth pace since the early 1990s (bar the Covid contortions). Among the early responses is VanEck, an investment house, headlined “labour market seemingly defies gravity”. The drop in the jobless rate after it had plateaued at 4.1% for three months “significantly [reduces] the chance of an RBA rate cut any time soon,” Russel Chesler, the firm’s head of Investments &amp; Capital Markets, said: The RBA is expecting the labour market to loosen quite a bit more as we hit the home stretch of the current tightening cycle, with the quarterly unemployment rate increasing by 40 basis points to 4.5% and remaining there until the end of 2026. Indeed, the RBA had forecast in November (ie recently) that the jobless rate would climb to 4.3% by December. This month will have to be a shocker for jobs for that result to transpire – which seems unlikely. A report out this morning by Deloitte’s involving chief financial officers found an uptick in sentiment. Among the economic risks cited, one of the highest priorities was “securing and retaining key talent”. Not exactly a strong sign that the labour market is about to get much looser. Former NSW Liberal MP Rory Amon appears in court The former NSW Liberal MP Rory Amon – who has been charged with sexual offences against a teenage boy – appeared in court today, where a date was set for a case conference. After his case was briefly heard at Sydney’s Downing Centre, the magistrate set the case conference between the parties – which will see the defence and prosecution negotiate and prepare for a potential trial – on 17 February. The matter will return to court on 27 February. Amon did not respond to questions from the media as he exited the court with his defence team. Amon, 35, was the member for Pittwater in Sydney’s northern beaches when he was arrested, and later granted bail, in August. He was also the shadow assistant minister for transport and roads, infrastructure and youth. He stepped down from parliament after he was charged, saying the nature of the allegations meant he was unable to “fully represent my community”. He has denied all the charges. Amon was charged with five counts of sexual intercourse with a person aged over 10 and under 14, two counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child over 10 and under 14, two counts of indecent assault on a person under 16, and committing an act of indecency with a person under 16. Deeming says she has ‘every right to be’ in Liberal party Moira Deeming said she has “every right to be” in the Liberal party as she did “nothing wrong” with the accusations “just disproven in court”. I’m perfectly capable of being a professional. I was a teacher. I can work with people. It’s not about us. It shouldn’t even be about our relationships. We’re supposed to be here to serve Victorians. You know, if you can’t be professional enough to put everything aside and serve Victorians, then you shouldn’t be in parliament. Deeming said the defamation judgment against Liberal leader John Pesutto was “very cathartic” but it should not have come to that. This could have all been avoided. I don’t understand the decisions that were made that led to this outcome. I had no other way to defend myself and to have these things retracted. I was never the aggressor. All I did was defend myself. Apparently, all I did wrong was refused to defame innocent women without any evidence. But I would have thought that’s the right thing to do. You know, I refuse to give up my principles and my advocacy for child safeguarding, and I would have thought that’s the right thing to do. I was pressured to resign, and why would I do that? The members wanted me as their representative. I never did anything wrong. I always acted in good faith. She said she would be willing to serve in the Liberal party. Moira Deeming is holding a press conference at parliament after she’s had a win in court against opposition leader John Pesutto. She begins by saying: This judgment is a public acknowledgment that there was never any justification, legal, moral or political for what was done to me and to my family. Not one Liberal party value was honoured or furthered in Victoria by this relentless and remorseless campaign to discredit me and everybody who stood by me, but I was never going to let it go unchallenged in this state. Greens urge government to rule out ‘exporting’ gambling ads to PNG amid NRL deal The Greens have urged the government to rule out “exporting” gambling ads into Papua New Guinea as part of the major deal to bring a PNG rugby league team to life. As we brought you earlier, the government is pumping hundreds of millions into PNG’s bid to join the national rugby league, with funding for the team, the licence fee to join the NRL, and upgrades to facilities and stadiums. Sarah Hanson-Young said in a statement the deal shouldn’t lead to sports betting ads on Australian TV being beamed into the Pacific. Sports betting and gambling ads are killing the spirit of sport. Australian sport lovers overwhelmingly want gambling ads banned and parents want their kids protected from the harms of gambling grooming. The Australian government and NRL boss Peter V’landys should rule out exporting gambling ads to the Pacific. The Albanese government has softened on its pledge to reform gambling ads, punting a promised reform package into next year. It is unclear what form the government’s final reforms might take, but the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has appeared to oppose a full gambling ad ban as proposed by late Labor MP Peta Murphy. Hanson-Young continued: The gambling lobby sucks billions of dollars out of the pockets of vulnerable families and communities. Without a strong ban on gambling ads, the parasites in the gambling industry will be looking to do the same in the Pacific. Save the Children Australia welcomes Australia’s UN votes Save the Children Australia has welcomed Australia’s votes in the UN – to demand that Israel reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency Unrwa and to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. CEO Mat Tinkler said while there is nothing that can be done to “bring back the tens of thousands of innocent lives already lost in this brutal war”, there is “still time to prevent further death and destruction” with an immediate and definitive ceasefire. Gaza is already the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, with the largest cohort of child amputees in modern history, and nearly every single child displaced and starving. If the government of Israel succeeds in dismantling Unrwa, it will be a death sentence for so many children that depend on its services to stay alive. Australia joins the vast majority of UN member states in voting in favour of these resolutions, just as a new survey from War Child reveals the terrifying psychological impact the war in Gaza is having on children. 96% of vulnerable children in Gaza report feeling their death is imminent and almost half of Gaza’s vulnerable children are wishing to die because of the war. Despite 14 months passing since the war in Gaza began, aid is still failing to reach families at the pace and scale that is needed —a political failure that history will not forget. Fall in jobless rate dims interest rate cut hopes, sends dollar higher, stocks down The financial markets viewed the November labour market numbers (see earlier post) as reducing the chance of a near-term interest rate cut from the RBA. The drop in the unemployment rate to 3.9%, the lowest in eight months, was one surprise for investors and pundits. The nearly 36,000 extra jobs added for the month – including 52,600 full-time roles – was also on the high side. An extra 10,000 or so in a labour market of 14.5m is in itself not a huge miss by economists. The drop to 67% in the participation rate (the share of those who could be employed who are looking for work) is a bit worse than the 67.1% rate, so that’s not really good for those hoping to be able to point to a loosening labour market. The dollar jumped about a quarter of a US cent on the news to 64.1 US cents was an indication that investors were less confident of an early RBA rate cut. Stocks skidded by about half a percent, giving up their gains for the day. Higher borrowing costs than anticipated would squeeze predicted profits. James Paterson condemns Wong’s defence against Netanyahu comments The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, has condemned Penny Wong’s defence against critical comments by Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as “reckless” and “callous”. After the arson attack against a Melbourne synagogue on Friday, Netanyahu accused the Australian government on social media of holding an “anti-Israel sentiment” in its recent votes at the UN, linking them to the attack. He wrote on X: It is impossible to separate the reprehensible arson attack from the federal government’s extreme anti-Israeli position. Wong hit back in a speech on Monday night saying it was not antisemitic to “expect that Israel should comply with the international law that applies to all countries”. She added: Australia can’t pick and choose which rules we are going to apply. We expect Russia to abide by international law and end its illegal full-scale war on Ukraine. We expect China to abide by international legal decisions in the South China Sea. We also expect Israel to abide by international law. Paterson told 2CC radio this morning the speech was “reckless in its nature and callous in its timing”. In the middle of a domestic terrorism crisis targeting the Jewish community, to compare the only Jewish state to the authoritarian states of Russia and China was an incredibly dangerous and irresponsible thing to do and I fear will give further licence and further encouragement to people targeting the Jewish community. Because antisemites draw no distinction between the state of Israel and the Jewish community living here in Australia, and it is very dangerous to give them encouragement, as the foreign minister has done. As we reported earlier, Australia today joined with more than 150 countries at the United Nations to demand that Israel reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency Unrwa and to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Wong: ‘We want this war to end and the hostages home’ Earlier this morning, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, issued a statement on the UN vote: For the past year, the world has been calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the immediate and unconditional release of hostages. Today 158 countries voted in favour of this, including Australia, the UK, NZ, Canada, Japan and Germany. We want this war to end and the hostages home. You can read our full story on this below, from Sarah Basford Canales and Josh Butler: Australian employers added more staff than expected last month and fewer people were hunting for work, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.9%. The economy added a net 35,600 jobs for the month, slightly better than the 25,000 more jobs expected by economists. The jobless rate’s decline from 4.1% in October was also better than expected. Pundits had predicted it would rise to 4.2%. Fewer people were looking for work, though, with the participation rate easing to 67%, contributing to the fall in the unemployment rate for November. Australia’s unemployment rate has dropped to 3.9%, its lowest since March. We’ll have more in a moment. First edition copy of ‘A Voyage to Terra Australis’ sells for nearly quarter of a million dollars A rare first edition of Matthew Flinders’ account of the first circumnavigation of Australia, A Voyage to Terra Australis, has sold in London for almost quarter of a million dollars. Auction house Christie’s described it as a “monumental work” and “the most outstanding book on the coastal exploration of Australia”. Flinders completed the trip in 1810, when he returned to London after almost seven years in captivity in Mauritius. Christie’s said: In the last few months of his life, while increasingly ill with a bladder complaint, Flinders laboriously corrected proofs of his Voyage until it was finally ready for publication in July 1814. The traditional account holds that the finished book was delivered to Flinders the day before he died, by which time he was already unconscious, so his wife ‘took the volumes and laid them upon his bed, so that the hand that fashioned them could touch them’. However, recent biographies agree that he was aware of the finished product. Indeed, a letter from his wife confirms that ‘he lived just to know, the work over which his life had been spent was laid before the world, for he left this earthly scene of things, a few days after its publication’. In the same lot, Flinder’s own copies of explorer George Vancouver’s Voyage and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardiere’s book on the d’Entrecasteaux expedition in search of La Pérouse, both “almost certainly” taken by Flinders on the HMS Investigator, were sold for AUD$176,000 and $75,500 respectively. A writing slope – an angled box used as a desk – was also sold for $70,500. Calls for Pesutto to resign after Deeming defamation judgment I’ve been standing by for a press conference by exiled Liberal MP Moira Deeming, who’s just had a huge win in court against the state opposition leader, John Pesutto. We’re yet to hear from Pesutto but there have already been calls for him to resign from the deputy premier, Ben Carroll. The former Liberal MP for Kew, Tim Smith, has also called for Pesutto’s resignation. We’ve just heard from the Deeming camp that her press conference has been delayed an hour until 12.15pm, as she consults with lawyers. Marape says Australia is PNG’s security partner of choice ‘in the first instance’ Back to the press conference with Anthony Albanese and James Marape: the leaders have responded to a question about the bilateral security deal and if it would stop PNG from agreeing to a security or policing deal with China or another nation if Australia didn’t approve. Anthony Albanese responded first, stating Australia was PNG’s security partner of choice. We both share a commitment to human rights. We both share market-based economies that are important as well. So our agreements go to the full range of relationships between two nations. James Marape said Australia was PNG’s security partner of choice “in the first instance”: That doesn’t stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours. We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner … but insecurity closer to home we have this synergy, our shared territory needs to be protected and defended and policed … Noone should take offence with PNG or Australia or even foreign relations elsewhere. It is something we choose to do in our own immediate perceived interests … Unions tell inquiry Coalition’s ‘nuclear mirage’ won’t create a single job The government’s parliamentary nuclear inquiry, called to scrutinise the Coalition’s nuclear proposals, is on the road again with a public hearing in Sydney today. Daniel Sherrell, a senior advisor on climate and energy at the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has just told the inquiry he doesn’t think the Coalition’s proposal for nuclear power will “create a single job” for Australia. It cannot attract investors and cannot compete economically and is forecast to remain the most expensive power source in Australia for decades and, for good reason, is illegal. We don’t have to count on the [nuclear] mirage appearing – we have jobs now in the renewable economy. Due to appear later today are climate advocacy groups and representatives of electricity generation companies, as well as an appearance by Climate 200 founder and energy expert Simon Holmes à Court. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, promised again this morning that the Coalition will reveal cost estimates for its nuclear plan before the end of this week. Marape and Albanese on security concerns Taking questions, James Marape was asked how he can guarantee the safety of players and officials in the coming years. He said the NRL deal would be a “lifestyle transformation for PNG and Port Moresby”. It is in my own national interest to make PNG safer. I have daughters and children who live in PNG forever, and the catalyst to make it urgent for me right now is the three-year window I have until 2028. Anthony Albanese also weighed in, pointing to the bilateral security arrangement, and saying there would be financial incentives as part of the arrangements and “I think that it will be an incredibly attractive place to go”. This is not just about what happens during the 80 minutes of play on the field at the NRL, this is an entire relationship of lifting up PNG. Marape says NRL deal ‘uniting our diverse country together’ James Marape said that through the NRL deal, “what you are gifting to us … goes to the heart of uniting our diverse country together.” For us it is not just sport and sport commerce, it is a deep national unity strategy. Uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG [and] Australia together in the way that matters most, people to people. Marape addresses press in Canberra Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, is now addressing reporters in Canberra, thanking those who helped make the NRL deal possible. In a world that is currently conflicted all over, I see as a leader of my country with concern the conflict happening in Eastern Europe and the Middle East … and the potential of conflict into the future. We want to preserve our Pacific [as a] safe and peaceful and good [place] for all of us to live in, especially our children. Wise, good generations construct the future in which their children can enjoy peace and comfort and life. He said the deal would be “pivotal in anchoring the PNG Australia relationship” and that “in the heart of every foreign relation lies people-to-people relations”. Pacific policing training facility opened this week Speaking to reporters, Anthony Albanese said today confirms the beginning of the bilateral security agreement, signed with PNG a year ago in Canberra. Since signing that landmark agreement we have made real progress with Australia providing tangible support to PNG’s internal security priorities, and just this week we have opened our Pacific policing initiative training facility in Brisbane, providing support for training and policing right across the Pacific – a $400m initiative that we announced and got support for as the centrepiece of our engagement at the Pacific island forum. Here is our story on the bilateral security agreement from when it was signed last year: Partnership to provide opportunities for women and girls to get involved in sport: Albanese Anthony Albanese said the partnership would provide opportunities for more women and girls to get involved in sports, telling reporters in Canberra: This partnership that I am announcing today is not just about Papua New Guinea, it is also about our relationship with the Pacific. The partnership will support young people in the Pacific, girls and boys, women and men, to play rugby league – with a focus on PNG but also on Fiji, Tonga and some more. It will complement our existing health and education programs in the Pacific and create new opportunities for women and girls to get involved as well. PM: ‘Sport brings us together. It unites us and it inspires us’ Anthony Albanese is recalling his visit to PNG for Anzac Day where he walked the Kokoda track, and – in particular – leaving the jungle and entering villages where people were wearing State of Origin jerseys. Every team represented. The children had such joy when they were passing the footballs that we carried along the track … It was so clear that sport brings us together. It unites us and it inspires us. It crosses borders and it filled bridges. In competing against each other, we learn from each other. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking to reporters in Canberra alongside the Papua New Guinean prime minister, James Marape. He has announced the Australian government is supporting a PNG team to join the national rugby league competition from 2028. Rugby league is the national sport of Papua New Guinea and PNG deserves a national team. The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea, it will call Port Moresby home. I know it will have millions, literally, of proud fans barracking for it from day one. Watch: Australia backs UN motion for immediate ceasefire in Gaza As we reported earlier, Australia has backed a UN motion for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. You can watch the moment the vote took place below: Victoria’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, defamed fellow Liberal MP Moira Deeming in comments made after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally she helped organise, a federal court has found. Deeming had sued Pesutto for comments made in a media release, a press conference and interviews in the days after the Let Women Speak rally on 18 March 2023, in which she argued the Liberal leader falsely portrayed her as a Nazi sympathiser. Pesutto had rejected the allegation. Justice David O’Callaghan handed down his judgment in the long-running case in the federal court just a moment ago. He said all five publications made by Pesutto were defamatory and ordered him to pay Deeming $300,000 in damages. Another big heatwave to bake Melbourne, strain power grid (again) It is summer, of course, and we do expect heatwaves. The one building over the next few days over inland Australia, though, looks pretty big. The Bureau of Meteorology predicts much of the east will be in at least a low-intensity heatwave (calculated versus historical levels and recent conditions) from Friday onwards, and lasting a few days into next week for some regions (see map). One difference is that the heatwave will take in Melbourne and parts of Sydney on Monday, bridging both a work day (for many, still) and two big population centres. Later, it will be Sydney and Brisbane sweating, while Melbourne will be getting some cool change relief. They’ll need it. Parts of the Victorian capital are forecast to reach 42C on Monday – lucky it’s not Christmas Day or the Boxing Day match. Anyway, the extent of the heat and its prolonged nature means the Australian Energy Market Operator is forecasting the possibility of “interrupted” supply (blackouts) for NSW on Monday. Whether we get a repeat of last month’s call for NSW residents not to use washing machines or pool pumps for a while remains to be seen. The market (i.e. generators) is being asked to respond and it usually does. Meanwhile, Victoria might have power strains on Monday as well. Aemo’s lack of reserve level 2 alerts aren’t as serious, but worth keeping an eye on. Authorities will be among those watching the mercury levels closely early next week. More on Victorian year 12 students receiving Atar results today To some, studying three mathematics subjects in year 12 would be a worst nightmare. But not Wheelers Hill secondary college student Xinle Huang who completed specialist mathematics, mathematical methods and general mathematics over Year 11 and 12. In her words: “I like maths a lot.” The love of maths helped her achieve an Atar of 99.35 this morning, bolstering her plans to study physiotherapy, optometry and pharmaceutical sciences. Xinle, the school’s international student captain, said the support of her teachers got her through. The school has a long-established international student program and one in four students speak a language other than English at home. The college’s principal, Fern Brisbane, said the school’s results were the best in several years, with several students achieving results in the 90s. Our kids have shined and, as a principal, I can’t ask for anything more. Shadow home affairs minister criticises Australia’s UN vote The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, has argued that Australia’s vote at the UN is “gaslighting” the Jewish community while “claiming to be concerned” about antisemitism. In a post to X just a moment ago, the Liberal senator also claimed the PM was “trading votes” at the UN for “votes in the inner city”: This is gaslighting of the Jewish community while claiming to be concerned about antisemitism. Anthony Albanese should at least have the decency to admit he is trading votes at the UN for votes in the inner city. Earlier, Labor minister Anne Aly warned against conflating Jewish Australians with the actions of the Israeli government, saying this “leads us down a very dangerous path.” Will the jobs machine that is the Australian economy grind to a halt in November? It’s a puzzle the strength of the labour market hasn’t got that much attention – but you can be sure they’ll be a few screaming headlines if there are some bad numbers out today when the ABS releases November labour market figures. The Albanese government hasn’t really talked up the “1 million jobs” that have been added since they took office in May 2022, a figure well above any previous term (although the population is of course growing so the proportional gain might need a bit of stats checking). Many of the jobs are in the non-market sector, as such commentators like to point out. Michele Bullock, the Reserve Bank governor, though, took umbrage this week at those views, pointing out that many were “very valuable” and “worthy jobs”. (Anyone with a child in school or a parent in an aged care home might well agree that staffing levels should be boosted.) Anyway, economists are expecting last month’s unemployment rate to tick up to 4.2% (it’s been steady at 4.1% for three months) with employers adding a net 25,000 jobs. As we note, these numbers need nuance. Are they full-time or part-time roles, were more or fewer people looking for work, and were there revisions to the previous month? Weak numbers – taking into account the above – will add to the likelihood of an RBA interest rate cut in February, while strong one will make rate relief less of a chance. Stay tuned for the 11.30am (AEDT) ABS release right here. Victorian year 12 students waking to check Atar results Thousands of year 12 students in Victoria have been anxiously waking to check their Atar results this year, as the first state or territory in the nation to receive them. But not everyone has been worried. 18-year-old Sajad Ramezani was already at work on a local building site when the results went live at 7am. The Tarneit senior college student was so busy on the job he hadn’t even had a chance to check his results. I’m doing carpentry full-time now. I want to finish fourth year and then do my certificate and hopefully open my own business in the future. Ramezani, who is completing a school-based apprenticeship and traineeship after successfully finishing his VCE vocational major, is following in the footsteps of his father, a carpenter who arrived in Australia with minimal english from Iran. Tarneit senior college had around 100 students studying the vocational major this year, which was introduced in 2023 to promote entry to industries like health, community services, trades and early childhood education. Australia has voted for a ceasefire in Gaza and to support a UN Palestinian aid agency that Israel is moving to dismantle. As AAP reports, the United Nations general assembly has overwhelmingly voted to support a permanent and unconditional ceasefire, the release of hostages, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians at an emergency session. The motion passed with 158 members voting in support and nine against, with 13 abstaining. The humanitarian crisis was a key factor in Australia’s vote, with more than 44,000 people killed in Gaza, including more than 13,000 children. Nearly all of the strip’s 2.1 million people have lost their homes and do not have enough food, water or medical supplies. Australia also voted to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in a second motion that passed with 159 in support, nine against and 11 abstaining. The motion called for the Israeli Knesset to reverse laws banning the agency from operating in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which include Gaza and the West Bank. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has repeatedly stated the agency was the only one with the capability to distribute aid and assistance at the scale needed in Gaza. Israel’s ambassador to the UN said the agency had been infiltrated by Hamas – something the UN denies – and accused the general assembly of ignoring the hostages taken by the terrorist organisation on 7 October. Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, spoke to ABC RN earlier this morning after the firebombing in a Melbourne synagogue last week and anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney. He described the incidents as “shocking [and] deeply distressing, and it has no place in our country.” He said that there had been an increase in antisemitism and that “we often see the vial of racism pouring out when there’s ruptures in our society”.: During Covid there was a huge increase in anti-Asian racism; during the referendum, a huge increase in First Nations racism; and now we’ve seen a definite increase in antisemitism, but also other forms of racism, like Islamophobia, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism. And what that points to is, I think we have a structural problem that is allowing racism to take place, and we really need a whole of government, whole of society approach to tackle racism. Asked about criticism of the government’s response to antisemitism, Sivaraman said the way in which racism is tackled across the board is often “disjointed”, “ad hoc” and “not coordinated”. I’ve been talking to Jewish communities and they feel vulnerable and they feel unsafe, and I acknowledge that that’s come through. But the reality is that we continuously have racism operating in our society, and it’s embedded in our systems and structures. The Australian Human Rights Commission has launched a national anti-racism framework that sets out 63 recommendations for the government to implement, steps that it believes can eventually stamp out racism.

The ombudsman, Anna Booth, said the secured commitments would help to drive cultural change across the University of Sydney and the wider university sector. It comes the same week the University of Melbourne agreed to pay more than $70m to staff in the widest ranging undertaking agreement entered into by a tertiary institution. Booth said: The University of Sydney has acknowledged its governance failures and breaches, and has responded by committing significant time and resources to put in place corrective measures that will ensure both full remediation of impacted staff and improved compliance for the future. These measures will also enhance information sharing and consultation between University of Sydney employees and its governance bodies – boosting worker voice – to promote the finding and resolution of any future compliance issues within the workplace. Booth said the university had also committed to a review into its casual academics and an independent audit. The University of Sydney has so far calculated more than $19m in underpaid wages for 14,727 current and former employees – ranging up to $83,271. Former NSW Liberal MP turned chair of the Climate Change Authority, Matt Kean, has spent the past few days criticising those attempting to politicise the CSIRO’s work on the likely costs of nuclear reactors. In case you missed it – Peter Dutton attacked the CSIRO after its latest GenCost report reaffirmed that electricity from nuclear energy in Australia would be at least 50% more expensive than power from solar and wind, backed up with storage. The opposition leader claimed: It just looks to me like there’s a heavy hand of Chris Bowen in all of this. In a post to X earlier this morning, Kean wrote: It is ridiculous to doubt our leading scientist’s energy modelling just because it clashes with your political ambitions. This follows similar tweets he has made over the past few days taking aim at those who doubt the CSIRO, saying they would “no doubt use WiFi daily, protect themselves with aeroguard, and use plastic banknotes” – which were “all invented [and] pioneered by the CSIRO”. Two teenagers arrested after shooting, car fire and pursuit that police believe are linked Two teenage boys have been arrested following a shooting, car fire and pursuit in Western Sydney overnight. According to NSW police, officers were patrolling the Rooty Hill area just after 2am when they attempted to stop a vehicle – which they allege did not stop – and a pursuit began. A short time later, the vehicle crashed into a parked car. The driver and passenger – two 17-year-old boys – were uninjured and arrested on scene. They were taken to Mount Druitt police station where they are assisting with inquiries, police said. About 2.10am, emergency services were called to Bungarribee nearby, after reports of a car fire. The blaze was extinguished and a crime scene established, with an investigation commenced into the incident. And at 2.20am, police were also called to reports of a public place shooting at Mt Druitt – where several bullet holes were located in the window of a business inside a shopping centre. A crime scene has been established and the investigation is ongoing. Police believe all three incidents are linked. The partner of a young woman has been charged with her domestic violence-related murder, AAP reports. Police found the 31-year-old Sydney woman’s body yesterday after a relative raised concerns about her welfare and officers broke into her home in Belmore, in the western suburbs. They allege she had been the victim of a “very violent murder”. NSW police have charged a man, 35, with domestic violence-related murder, contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, using a prohibited weapon contrary to a prohibition order and failing to comply with a digital evidence access order direction. He is due to appear in Campbelltown local court today. The woman is yet to be formally identified, police said. Khalil says Australia’s foreign policy position has been ‘very consistent’ Peter Khalil, the special envoy on social cohesion, was also asked about the UN vote today calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Q: Is Australia joining in a global coalition of countries who are concerned about Israel’s actions in the Middle East, and is our stance on Israel hardening? He said Australia had been “very consistent in its foreign policy position”: We voted for a ceasefire 12 months ago at the UN and have done so a number of times. We want to see an ends to the war, a return of all hostages, an end to the human suffering. There’s been support for unimpeded access to humanitarian aid, and 152 countries that have voted for those resolutions in the general assembly. Australia’s foreign policy has been very consistent in that respect. I think everyone wants to see an end to the war and a return much hostages. There’s many things we can do at the international level and we’re working with our partners to do so. Australia has limitations on how much it can move the dial. Peter Khalil says hate speech and violence over difference of views ‘morally reprehensible’ Labor MP Peter Khalil has been speaking with with ABC News Breakfast about the rise in antisemitic attacks, and said it is incumbent on government to set the normative standard that “no Australian should be attacked because of their faith identity”. We all have different political views, different ideological views, and people have a right to express those freely, so long as it’s done peacefully and respectfully. When it crosses into hate speech or violence, that’s not just unacceptable, it’s morally reprehensible, and I think it’s incumbent on governments to set that normative standard, to lower the temperature, to set the right cultural standards, but also leaders across community as well. He defended the government and said it had been engaging with the Jewish community for a long period of time, but added it “can do better, absolutely.” The really important point is supporting the community, but also setting that standard across society that whatever is happening overseas, whatever is happening on the other side of the world, that’s no excuse for any form of terrorism, any form of attack on someone based on their faith or their ethnicity. The assistant commissioner of the AFP, Krissy Barrett, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the police investigation into the synagogue attack. Without going into specifics of the investigation, she said the team had made “significant progress in the five days since the terrible incident at the synagogue.” Barrett wouldn’t put a timeframe on arrests, and said: We need to give our investigators the time and space to fully investigate and do what they need to do … there are a number of persons of interest that we are investigating. She was also asked about criticism that police did not declare the attack a terror incident on Friday, when it occurred. She said she understood the public commentary on Friday, but “we don’t work on public opinion”. We work on intelligence and evidence, and we can’t make assumptions. It’s a really serious decision to label something as a terrorist incident, and it comes with significant penalties. So it’s a decision that we take very seriously. Asked if there has been a specific and elevated threat against Jewish Australians, Barrett said “I do think that we’ve seen that through the data”. The advertising regulator, Ad Standards, has revealed the most complained about ads of 2024. It received more than 4,000 complaints throughout the year, with KFC receiving the most complains (69) for a TV ad with a woman leaving the bedroom of a younger man, to the surprise of her daughter. There was found to be no breach. There was also no breach with the second-most complained about ad – from Red Rooster – showing a skateboarder stealing chicken at a skate park. In third place was a TV ad for a super fund showing a woman holding a disfigured cake, with a man letting out a high-pitched scream, found to have no breach. (Gruen had a look at this one before the super fund changed the ad a week later.) A TV ad for erectile dysfunction treatment, showing a man and woman discussing a garden hose, was also found to have no breach. The seventh most complained about – a billboard ad for a brothel with images of women in lingerie – was found to breach standards. A TV ad for an insurance company, showing a pool cleaner coming to life after being struck by lightning, was also found to be in breach – due to frightening imagery, particularly for children. Aly says local Jewish community feeling more unsafe than ever Anne Aly has been making the rounds on breakfast programs, also been speaking with ABC RN this morning. She was asked about criticism the government refers to Islamophobia when it talks about antisemitism – is a particular and acute problem with antisemitism right now? The minister said she had spoken with her local Jewish community and “they’ve told me how unsafe they feel.” I know that there is Islamophobia. There’s an Islamophobia register that documents Islamophobia as well, but I have to say I have never before heard from my local Jewish community the level of incidents that they’re feeling at the moment and that they’re experiencing at the moment, and the level of the fear and unsafety that they’re experiencing at the moment. Value of Australian homes may drop in early 2025 According to research by CoreLogic, the start of 2025 may see a continuation of the “drag” on buyer demand – which could result in a small decline in national home values in the first part of the year. As AAP reports, the research says a drop in interest rates by the Reserve Bank in 2025 could increase demand among prospective buyers: The implementation of stage-3 tax cuts from July this year showed an anaemic response in the housing market, with national home value growth continuing to slow. The report says the slowdown in rent growth recorded in 2024 is also expected for 2025 as demand continues to be squeezed due to high cost-of-living constraints. Any unemployment increase in 2025 may disproportionately affect renting households, as they tend to be younger people or lower-skilled workers on more precarious employment arrangements. But in the face of elevated interest rates and global uncertainty, the Australian housing market demonstrated “surprising resilience” throughout 2024, the report said. It found the number of homes had increased 8% on the previous year. Last month, a report by SQM Research said Sydney and Melbourne property prices are forecast to drop by as much as 5% next year as high borrowing costs keep a lid on home values: Aly says conflating Jewish Australians with Israeli government ‘leads us down very dangerous path’ Continuing from our last post: Anne Aly was asked about comments from the Coalition that taking a tougher stance on Israel is leading to increased antisemitism in the community. She said there was not “any excuse for antisemitism” and told the program: I remember after 9/11, the attacks that were happening on Muslim communities and people were saying, ‘Well, it’s retaliation for 9/11, it’s because of what Isis is doing or al-Qaeda is doing’. Jewish Australians have nothing to do with the Israeli government. Jewish Australians have nothing to do with the actions of the Israeli government, and I think, conflating the two – conflating Jewish Australians with the actions of an Israeli government is – leads us down a very dangerous path. I have been down that path. I have been down that path where Muslim Australians were being blamed for whatever Isis or al-Qaeda did. So I think we need to be very mindful of the fact that when we talk about Jewish Australians, we’re talking about people who live here in this country who have nothing to do with what is happening in Israel and we need to separate the two issues and not conflate them. As we flagged earlier, Australia is expected to join several other countries at an emergency session of the UN this morning in a vote for a resolution to demand Israel reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency, Unrwa. It will also call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Is Australia’s stance on Israel’s actions in Gaza toughening? Anne Aly told ABC News Breakfast “I think there has been a shift, but there has also been a shift in the contexts in which the Israeli government is operating.” And I think the shift has been necessitated by the fact that the Israeli government has been found guilty by the International Court of Justice, by the declarations that have been made by the ICC as well, and Australia – as a good global citizen, as a signatory to the ICJ and to the ICC – must uphold the laws, the international laws and the international rules of warfare, that we are signatories to. If the Israeli government flouts those laws, then we have a responsibility to act accordingly. Anne Aly recalls Australian response after Christchurch attacks and hopes same will happen for Jewish community now Anne Aly was also asked about rhetoric claiming the government hasn’t taken antisemitism seriously enough and has enabled the kind of attacks seen in recent weeks. She said that as a person of Islamic faith, “I feel very strongly [that] everybody should be able to live in safety and without fear in Australia.” I believe very strongly in social cohesion as an essential part of the glue that brings us all together and makes Australia one of the most wonderful places in the world to live. It does worry me that the Jewish community in Australia feels unsafe. It does worry me that the Jewish community in Australia has been the target of these attacks. I recall a time when my own faith community felt unsafe. I recall a time when my own faith community was attacked, and I also recall a time after the … the Christchurch terrorist attack that Australians came together and reached a hand out to Muslim Australians and said, ‘You can be safe here.’ I would hope that all Australians do the same for our Jewish community, that [we will] respond in that same vein for our Jewish community here in Australia. News bargaining code announcement expected today The youth minister, Anne Aly, spoke with ABC News Breakfast just earlier ahead of the news bargaining code announcement, expected today. Asked if the updated code would include financial penalties for breaches by the big tech companies, Aly said to wait for the minister’s announcement. What I can say is that the government believes that journalists should be fairly compensated for the work that they do, that there is a current regime in place but that’s not working. And so that’s why the government has turned its attention to updating this code and ensuring that social media companies pay for the news that they use as content on their platforms. Sarah Basford Canales has more details on this, below: Meta says it has suffered a global outage, with some users facing issues while using Instagram, Facebook and the WhatsApp messaging service. It said in a post to X: We’re aware that a technical issue is impacting some users’ ability to access our apps. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience. You can read more details on this below: Dutton stands by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flag comments Speaking to Sunrise, Peter Dutton also stood by his pledge not to display the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags if elected the next prime minister. Echoing his earlier comments, Dutton said: The argument is: how can you be united as a country if we’re asking people to identify under different flags? No other western democracy does that. So I believe very strongly we should have an enormous amount of respect for the Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander flags but they are not our national flag. Asked if he would also seek to remove the Aboriginal flag from the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Dutton said he would “work with the state governments.” Obviously the state government has made a decision to put the flag up there, but for us, at a federal level, I’m not going to pretend that our country can be united when we’re asking people toed identify in different ways. Although he eventually said it was a “decision for the NSW government.” The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, was on Sunrise earlier this morning, as the Coalition is expected to detail its nuclear plan costings today. Asked if he is rethinking his claim that nuclear would cut people’s power bills, given the CSIRO report, Dutton said: “No, we’re not.” He pointed to international examples and continued to defend the Coalition’s plan: We will release our costings this week. When you think of how much money the government is spending on the renewables-only policy, it’s cheaper than what the government is providing at the moment. Asked if he could guarantee the Coalition will cut people’s power, Dutton said “yes, we can”, and claimed nuclear reactors could be built “very quickly” if there is bipartisan support. We say 2035 to 2037 before the first reactor comes in. There is bound to be lots of talk on nuclear today – for the latest, you can have a read below from our environment and climate team: Steggall backs Labor’s childcare plans Independent MP Zali Steggall has backed the government’s proposed $3bn childcare plans. Labor yesterday said it would introduce the childcare subsidy for three days a week to all families earning up to $530,000 a year from January 2026. A second-term Labor government would also scrap the controversial activity test, the PM said. Speaking on the Today Show just earlier, Steggall was asked about a report in the Australian saying it would “slug” taxpayers with $1bn, and said: “I think we have to remember it’s eye-watering for families, right?” I think it depends on how you can pull out numbers that way. But the reality is [this is] part of the cost is building new centres in areas where they simply don’t have enough access … Families are slugged with this cost. We have to invest in our people if we want to be a great nation, and that means providing childcare centres. And happy Thursday – Emily Wind here, I’ll be taking you through our live coverage for most of today here on the Australia news blog. As always, you can get in touch with any tips, feedback or questions via email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s get started. Universities Australia has called for the re-establishment of the Howard-era education investment fund in its federal election statement. The statement, released today ahead of next year’s election, urged both major parties to provide bipartisan support for Australia’s universities to prepare for the challenges ahead. Universities Australia’s CEO, Luke Sheehy, said: Universities matter to Australia’s future. The decisions made by the next federal government, and subsequent ones, will shape Australia’s ability to manage and prosper from these big shifts under way in our economy. Our universities are national assets and should be treated as such, receiving bipartisan support to grow and succeed in the national interest. The statement called for a number of reforms, including the re-establishment of the Education investment fund, established by the Howard government and supported by subsequent Labor governments to fund teaching, training and research facilities at universities. The $4bn fund was disbanded in 2019. Universities Australia also urged both major parties to reverse their attacks on international education and implement Indigenous-related recommendations in the Universities Accord. Social media news and laws anticipated today Our politics reporter Sarah Basford Canales has been following the story I mentioned at the top about how the government is going to try to make tech companies keep paying for news content it takes from Australian publishers. Her reporting tells us that companies could face heavy penalties if they refuse to negotiate deals. Read her full story here as we stand by for more details from the government: The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) will issue a vote of no confidence in the Australia National University’s vice-chancellor if she remains in her position until next year. Prof Genevieve Bell has been facing increasing pressure since a series of articles published in the Australian Financial Review (AFR) detailed a second paid job she held at Intel while in the vice-chancellor position. In a statement, the NTEU called on the ANU council to remove Bell before February 2025, when it next meets, to “prevent further damage to the ANU”. If not, the NTEU will conduct a vote of no confidence, pointing to flagged job cuts, a majority vote against management’s proposal for staff to forego their pay rise and her job at Intel. A spokesperson for ANU said as a public institution, it had a “responsibility to use the taxpayer’s money responsibly”. For us to sell assets to continue running operational deficits would be very poor practice, and one of the key reasons we’ve been able to retain a strong credit rating is because ratings agencies can see we are committed to getting our budget back in order. They said Bell’s work with Intel was “no secret” and published on the university’s own website, adding the arrangement was disclosed through its conflict processes and known by the council. It is common across universities for academics to work with external parties in their fields of expertise. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Emily Wind with the main action. The Albanese government is tipped to announce this week that it will try to force big tech companies to continue paying Australian news organisations for content. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said it would stop paying for news as agreed in a deal with the Coalition government in March 2022. Today could also be the day when the Coalition tells us how much it will claim it’s going to cost to build the nuclear power stations it says we need. There will be intense focus on the numbers, not least because we have a story this morning reporting that the cost could be double even the CSIRO estimate dissed by Peter Dutton this week. Australia is expected to join several other countries at an emergency session of the UN this morning in a vote for a resolution to demand Israel reverse its ban on the Palestinian aid agency, Unrwa. It will also call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza in a move likely to further enrage Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the weekend’s spat. We’ll have details of the vote from New York when it goes down. And the education union is pushing for a vote of no confidence in the Australian National University’s vice-chancellor – more on this soon."

                    "bodyText": "Is that you? Or is it the bot? Linguists have said the nuance and character of human language is at risk, as Apple becomes the latest tech firm to launch artificial intelligence tools that can rewrite texts and emails to make users sound more friendly or professional. The ability to lighten a grumpy missive or turn arcane language into something a five-year-old could understand is promised from the new technology, which will be available on UK iPhones, iPads and Macs from Wednesday. But the potential boon for time-pressed people who struggle for the right writing tone has brought warnings that such tone-shifting technology could devalue and flatten human communication. One language expert described the automatic systems as “the ultimate superficiality”. Apple’s developers have been training its AI model on unspecified bodies of text. Around half of all phones sold in the UK are made by Apple, and its AI launch comes after Google and Microsoft released their own tools to help users adjust their writing tone through their Gemini and Copilot AIs. Last week Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, said of the writing tools: “It’s still coming from you. It’s your thoughts and your perspective.” He compared it to a spreadsheet doing sums automatically rather than punching them into calculator, or using a word processor instead of typing. In the US, where the Apple Intelligence system has been live for weeks, users reported that the tools can on occasion make you “come off sounding stuffy”. Another new feature that summarise emails and texts has turned the most emotional exchanges into robotic bullet points. In one case, a text from a girlfriend breaking up with her boyfriend was boiled down to: “No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from the apartment.” The optional summaries can also strip out nuance and humour, rendering messages “administrative and robotic”, said one user who sent a picture of their young son having fun working with his dad on a car, which the AI had summarised as: “Photo shared of child reaching into car hood; air filter changed.” A summary of some information from a Ring door camera app posted by a user on Reddit read bafflingly: “Dog took boot. Kitten cheese escaped the house.” A message from Amazon was rendered as “package was delivered tomorrow”, and five Gmails were summed up with the bleak couplet “Russia launches missile and drone attack; shop early for Black Friday Deals”. Apple has said it is continuing to improve the features with the help of user feedback. Also on Wednesday Google unveiled its next generation of personal agents which will surf the internet for you, carry out boring work tasks, fill your grocery basket and even coach you in computer games tactics. The new Gemini 2.0 agents have been released to developers and for trials. The company’s Nobel Prize winning AI leader, Demis Hassabis, admitted the advances open up “many questions … for safety and security”. A demonstration featured a man visiting London asking his agent to dig out from his emails the door code of the apartment he was staying in and remember it. Google said it was carrying out “extensive risk assessments”. One agent – Project Astra - is multilingual and talks at the speed of normal human conversation. Prof Tony Thorne, a language consultant at King’s College London, said: “AI is nudging us towards a neutral language that is much less rich.” He suggested it could foster uncertainty about who, or what, we are actually texting or emailing with. Rewritten texts would lack the sender’s “idiolect”, the distinctive suite of words and grammar that gives personality to our sentences, he said. Apple’s AI system does not analyse users’ data to train itself, which is good news for customers concerned about data security but not for those hoping the AI might learn their tone. “[AI] misses emphasis, nuance and the force of different aspects of a conversation,” Thorne said. “I don’t think it knows the difference between those that are crucial emotionally and descriptively and those that are just text.” Previous studies have shown that using algorithmic responses increases the use of positive emotive language. But if writers are suspected of using tone filters, readers view them more negatively. Prof Rob Drummond, a sociolinguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “We are giving control of forming our identity to a machine. It is creating an extra layer of inauthenticity to this identity creation. I do wonder if longer term people are going to react against that.” He described automatic tone changing as “the ultimate superficiality”. The Apple Intelligence assistance will be available only on certain iPhones with the 18.2 operating system. It will be rolled out this week in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Versions for use in the European Union, where regulations differ, are expected in April 2025. The system will also allow users to create AI versions of their photos in an “image playground”, adding costumes and changing locations, and to create their own bespoke emojis and “clean up” photos by using the AI to remove unwanted objects or people. Apple is linking its Siri voice assistant to OpenAI’s ChatGPT system when it determines that the Microsoft-backed AI provider can give a helpful answer. It will ask the user before any request for information is sent outside Apple’s secure domain."

                    "bodyText": "Like many music fans with a conscience, I use Spotify begrudgingly. I need to listen to a vast amount of music for work; I want to listen to a vast amount of music for fun, and I would have to forgo groceries if I attempted to buy it all. Still, I resent its financial distribution model to artists: my £11.99 a month isn’t divided between the musicians I actually listen to, but proportionally related to their popularity across the platform, meaning Ed Sheeran is getting significantly more of my money than Mabe Fratti. Spotify hosts music almost certainly made by fake artists or AI; playlists are prioritised over albums; there was the whole Joe Rogan thing that made Joni Mitchell and Neil Young quit the platform for a year. Perhaps counterintuitively, I have less ire for Spotify Wrapped, the packaging of a user’s year in listening that Spotify revamps annually with silly little made-up genre names (pink Pilates princess strut pop?) and flattering stats about being in the top 0.5% of any given act’s listeners. It unarguably puts a tidy bow on Spotify’s poor artist remuneration – as well as big-tech creep – and is nothing more than a giant marketing push that its users carry out for free. But the main gripe against it this year is the company’s frank use of AI – as if previous years’ instalments were as lovingly curated as a handmade mix CD. In a comment piece for the New Yorker titled “The hollow allure of Spotify Wrapped”, critic Brady Brickner-Wood writes: “If we can’t trust the apps to tell us a meaningful story about our art consumption, how will anyone, including ourselves, ever discover the idiosyncratic composition of our inner lives?” Is anyone who deeply cares about music entrusting the idiosyncratic composition of their inner lives to these platforms? It seems like an astonishing fool’s errand that anyone would ever want something so personal and immeasurable from an app, in this case a tech company that has hijacked music consumption for capital and that only cares about your taste insofar as it can harvest your consumer profile for profit. But I understand the desire for a useful at-a-glance look at your music taste and have the perfect, stalwart solution to this predicament: last.fm, a data-focused archive of your listening habits. I have been using last.fm to “scrobble” my music history since 22 April 2007, recording music I play across Apple’s Music app and Spotify (though sadly I reset it in late 2011, apparently embarrassed by my youthful taste). You can use its calendar setting to look at your artist/track/album charts from the last week/month/six months/year/all time, or any window you specify, if you’re keen to remember who you were in, say, July 2015 (a huge Julia Holter fan, apparently). It was founded in 2002 and now runs a reduced service compared to its early days, although not an enshittified one: it doesn’t package my listening back to me in stimulating graphics like Spotify does, but provides a genuinely useful, straightforward list of my life in music – when Guardian writers come to vote for our albums of the year, it’s the first place I look to discern the sound of my 2024. Moreover, as I come up on half a lifetime spent on the site, it genuinely does tell me stories about who I was and am. As a teenager going off to uni to study French and German, I used its “recommended radio” function – my first bite of the algorithm – to discover music from those countries, and found an all-time favourite in the late French punk Lizzy Mercier Descloux. I joined the University of Bristol last.fm group before I got there and befriended someone who had great music taste and seemed cool, only to realise we had been put in the same massive house and would spend the next two years together squeezing the city’s gig scene dry. I met one of their last.fm friends when I went to Chicago a few years later; just last week we updated each other’s addresses for our annual Christmas card exchange. It’s also played a reasonable role in my love life. In my late teens, I flirted heavily with my then-crush on its messaging function while cramming all the new-to-me bands we were about to see at my first ATP festival. When an actual dating service based its matches on the last.fm API, it proved so accurate that I’d already been out with two of my top five, one of them twice. This summer, I started seeing someone who is also an inveterate last.fm user. The social side of the site has long lapsed, but we added each other as friends for the novelty of it. Even though I already felt we were well matched, last.fm designating our comparability as “SUPER” charmed me, as does seeing my favourite music infiltrate his stats. My account contains so much information about me that I feel like it should set off a wellbeing alarm somewhere when I’ve been listening to the National for several days straight (certainly one went off elsewhere when I accidentally leaked the track list for their surprise last album after I forgot to turn off scrobbling). Although more tellingly, at least to me, I can see I hardly played them at all in summer 2022, when my life fell apart at my own hands and I didn’t want to create negative associations with any beloved music, much as I would have found comfort in it. Instead, Haim’s Women in Music Part III became my lonely driving companion, Sam Gendel’s parched sax the soundtrack to my walks. Last.fm can be a great motivator: a friend told me that as he’s got older, the statistics encourage him to listen as he did when he was younger because he can look back and see when his efforts at discovery are waning. It reveals to me when a musician is going from someone I’ve dabbled in to a fully fledged fave. I only discovered Clarissa Connelly a couple of months ago, but the Scottish/Danish composer has shot into my top five most-played artists of the year. The data is one thing; remembering listening to her while co-working in my flat with my aforementioned new last.fm friend is the bigger picture of what her music has come to mean to me. Similarly, Death Cab for Cutie made a return to my top three for the first time since my teens – when I posted on a music forum using one of their song titles as my handle – ahead of us seeing them in London in the summer. But whether Spotify Wrapped or last.fm, the numbers can only ever be a prompt to remember who you really were during Brat summer, or Driver’s License January, or, you know, nihilist Gilla Band autumn 2022. We can’t trust streaming platforms to tell us a meaningful story about our art consumption and should never fall for the suggestion that they could. (For a good story on what streaming platforms have done to our consumption, meanwhile, read critic and reporter Liz Pelly’s new book Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist.) Worst of all, some listeners seem defeated by the idea that “the algorithm” (a concept that critic Max Read debunks well) is making them boring. Break out of it! Set yourself listening seasons and projects; form a music group chat with friends and swap recommendations. Taste isn’t just what the machine feeds you, or how many times you listened to an artist, or what upper percentile of their fans you exist in, but the experiences it is woven into, the relationships it reflects, the colour it adds to your life. In my opinion, last.fm still rules – but when it comes to taste, the last word should be yours."

                    "bodyText": "Paul McCartney has backed calls for laws to stop mass copyright theft by companies building generative artificial intelligence, warning AI “could just take over”. The former Beatle said it would be “a very sad thing indeed” if young composers and writers could not protect their intellectual property from the rise of algorithmic models, which so far have learned by digesting mountains of copyrighted material. He spoke out amid growing concern that the rise of AI is threatening income streams for music, news and book publishers. Next week the UK parliament will debate amendments to the data bill that could allow creators to decide whether or not their copyrighted work can be used to train generative AI models. The amendments, championed by Beeban Kidron, would require operators of internet bots that copy content to train generative AI models to comply with copyright laws. Some publishers, such as Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and the Financial Times, have already struck licensing deals to allow Open AI to train its large language models on their journalism. In contrast, the New York Times has sued Open AI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. In a statement supporting a campaign for creatives to get paid by the AI companies using their work, McCartney said: “We[’ve] got to be careful about it because it could just take over and we don’t want that to happen particularly for the young composers and writers [for] who, it may be the only way they[’re] gonna make a career. If AI wipes that out, that would be a very sad thing indeed.” McCartney used machine-learning technology to help produce last year’s Beatles song Now and Then by isolating John Lennon’s vocal performance from a recording made in 1970. But that differs from the way AI firms train their large language models on vast bodies of often copyrighted material without paying for it. Ministers are also set to consult on how the copyright issue should be handled in the UK. The system that is likely to best suit the tech companies would require artists, writers and publishers to opt out of having their creations mined to train large language models. But lobby groups such as the News Media Association (NMA), which represents newspaper publishers, want a system that requires them to opt in instead. On Tuesday, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the Commons culture, media and support select committee that the government had not decided which model it would propose in the forthcoming consultation but she highlighted reservations about a system that would require creatives to opt out. Nandy said: “We have looked at the limitations of similar legislation in the USA and the EU, so we have reservations about this idea that you can simply just say I want to opt out and then find that you have been completely erased from the internet.” That may put her in opposition to the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, whose department has “fully drunk the Kool-Aid on AI”, according to the committee chair, Caroline Dinenage. He is thought likely to want copyrighted material to be available to the tech companies unless creators opt out. The novelist Kate Mosse has also backed the campaign for amendments that would allow the enforcement of the UK’s existing copyright law, thereby allowing creators to negotiate for fair payment when licensing their content. She said an opt-out would not work. “As a writer, I want to engage with AI, and I do engage with AI,” Mosse said. “But we are looking for the F word – fairness. Copyright exists. Intellectual property exists. But the law is not being kept and there is a clear obfuscation of the law. “If you say you want to be paid, it will seem you are dismissing AI. There is a deliberate blurring from the tech firms … if copyright is watered down, it will severely damage the creative industries and without [it] there will be nothing left.”"

Here were today’s major developments: Victoria police are investigating a suspicious fire at a synagogue on Glen Eira Avenue in Ripponlea. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, labelled the incident an “attack on Australian values” and called it antisemitic, as did the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, who will deploy additional resources to the area. The prime minister will use his latest trip to Western Australia to announce $21m in funding for critical minerals projects, just days after WA’s government helped sink the federal nature positive laws given concern about its impact on mining and industry. Immigration minister Tony Burke has confirmed that “a bit less than half” the Palestinians who arrived in Australia on tourist visas have been transferred over to humanitarian visas. And TV personality Maggie Tabberer has died aged 87. Queensland Labor may oppose parts of ‘adult crime, adult time’ bill in parliament Queensland Labor MPs have hinted the party may oppose parts of the LNP government’s flagship “adult crime, adult time” legislation next week. Opposition members of a parliamentary inquiry into the legislation submitted a dissenting statement, which raised a number of reservations about the bill. “It is clear from many stakeholders that there is no evidence to support the premise that this approach will result in a reduction in victim numbers,” they wrote. In fact, almost every expert who made a submission to the Justice, Integrity and Community Safety Committee’s inquiry into the Making Queensland Safer Bill reinforced the evidence that in fact it is likely to increase offending. The inquiry had just eight days to consider the laws, which dramatically increase maximum sentences for children as young as 10 convicted of proscribed “adult offences”. For instance, a child murderer must be sentenced to life behind bars with a minimum 20 year non-parole period. It violates the state’s human rights act. Many submitters complained the pace of the parliamentary inquiry made it impossible to identify errors in the legislation. The committee also held just two days of hearings. One of them was occupied by a series of Townsville non-experts, including the city’s business council, but it couldn’t find time for a former state attorney general, and didn’t hear from the police commissioner or victims commissioner. Despite a chorus of concern by the experts, it ultimately made a single recommendation: that the bill be passed. It will return to parliament for a final vote next week. Severe thunderstorm warnings for areas north and west of Sydney Severe thunderstorms likely to produce “damaging winds and heavy rainfall” are hitting parts of New South Wales, with the warning zone extending through Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury and Gosford/Wyong areas. The Bureau of Meteorology said the slow moving thunderstorms were detected near Cattai and Maroota about 4.40pm, forecast to reach Wilberforce and Glenorie by 5.10pm and Windsor by 5.40pm. The NSW State Emergency Service has advised people to move their cars under cover or away from trees, secure loose items, keep away from fallen power lines and stay indoors away from windows amid the risk of flash flooding. A more general severe thunderstorm warning is also current for the Hunter, central tablelands and parts of the mid north coast, metropolitan, Illawarra, south coast, southern tablelands, north-west slopes, south-west slopes and Riverina districts. Albanese government files to extend surveillance of convicted terrorist Benbrika Convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika could be kept on a tight leash as the federal government tries to extend surveillance of him. Police have been surveilling the Melbourne man and keeping tabs on his communications since he was released from prison after the federal government successfully extended a supervision order. On Friday the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, filed an application to extend the order by another year. A spokesperson from his office said this was the “strongest possible action available under law and followed advice from all operational agencies involved in the matter”. It is now a matter for the court. Benbrika was convicted over plots to attack Melbourne landmarks including Crown casino and the MCG on AFL grand final day in 2005. After almost two decades behind bars, Benbrika walked free in 2023 with 30 strict conditions on his release including a lifetime ban from Crown and the MCG and an order preventing him from going within one kilometre of an airport or port. The federal government’s application for an extended supervision order on his release was only the third time such an order has been imposed since laws passed in December 2021. – AAP Mehreen Faruqi: ‘Insurance companies should not be taking advantage of the climate crisis to jack up premiums.’ Insurance has become the “latest major stressor” for communities facing disasters from the climate crisis, the Greens have said. A report released today into the impact of climate risk on insurance premiums and availability made eight recommendations to tackle growing insurance affordability stress, including increasing the disaster ready fund and requiring the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor and publish reports on premium prices. Chair of the committee and Greens deputy leader, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, urged the federal government to adopt all recommendations as a “good start” to addressing community stressors. Insurance is increasingly unaffordable and unavailable because insurance companies are either pulling out or hiking premiums and making people’s lives even harder. It’s bad enough that communities are traumatised by climate-driven disasters, but then they have to suffer insurance companies and their onerous, drawn-out claims process which have little to no transparency. Insurance companies should not be taking advantage of the climate crisis to jack up premiums. Legal organisations in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia have released a joint statement warning lawyers against using ChatGPT and other public artificial intelligence systems in their casework. The joint statement from the Law Society of New South Wales, the Legal Practice Board of Western Australia and the Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner came on Friday after a number of cases in Australia in the past year where courts had identified AI use in court cases where it had generated fake case citations. The statement says lawyers must maintain client confidentiality, and that lawyers cannot safely enter confidential information into public AI chatbots or services like ChatGPT, and any commercial AI tools where client information is entered, lawyers should review the contract terms to ensure the information is kept secure. AI tools should also not substitute a lawyer’s own legal advice as “LLM-based tools cannot reason, understand or advise”, the statement says. Due to AI “hallucinations” producing incorrect information, the statement says lawyers using AI to prepare documents must verify the information in those documents. The statement also says lawyers should be transparent with clients over use of AI, and limit AI use to lower-risk tasks. Panthera administrators issue statement on sale to Francom Group We reported yesterday that Panthera, one of Australia’s biggest private debt collectors, had been sold and its brand name would cease to exist. That follows a Guardian Australia investigation that revealed how the company had circumvented a blacklisting designed to stop it from conducting debt collection in Victoria, imposed after findings it had unlawfully attempted to retrieve money from people who owed nothing. Panthera is now facing criminal charges and has been in voluntary administration for months, a process managed by PwC. The administrators issued a statement late yesterday on Panthera’s sale to Francom Group. The transaction transforms Francom into one of the biggest debt collectors in the country. Voluntary administrator and PwC partner Adam Colley said: We set out to identify a suitable purchaser that would provide ongoing job security for Panthera’s workforce, continuity of operations, and a positive result for stakeholders. This transaction with Francom allows for these outcomes. We will continue to work with Panthera and Francom’s management and staff to ensure a smooth transition of the business to the new ownership structure. Six people jailed over $10m tax fraud Six men have been sentenced to a combined maximum term of 43 years in prison for participation in a $10m tax fraud and money laundering operation. The men were sentenced following a joint multi-year investigation of a serious organised criminal syndicate allegedly using labour hire and payroll companies associated with the building and construction industry to defraud the commonwealth. The AFP alleged in court the criminal syndicate ran a tiered structure of corporate entities providing labour hire services, which would receive money to pay the wages and tax of workers. The defrauded funds were then allegedly moved to companies directed by syndicate members, their relatives and associates, and offshore to Singapore. AFP detective superintendent Kristie-Lee Cressy said those who sought to exploit and steal from the commonwealth were preventing the potential investment of millions of dollars in essential services and infrastructure for the community. Anyone who deliberately sets out to exploit and defraud the financial system is engaging in criminal behaviour. The AFP, through the SFCT, is dedicated to targeting offenders and bringing them to justice. Man arrested after explosions and fire in Gosford, NSW A man has been arrested after several explosions and a fire occurred in Gosford yesterday afternoon. About 2.20pm yesterday, emergency services were called to an office building on Donnison Street in Gosford, following reports of several explosions. The building was evacuated, and no injuries were reported. Shortly afterward, police were called to a separate office building on Donnison Street following reports of a fire. At the scene, police were told that a man allegedly entered the office and lit a fire before leaving the scene. A 54-year-old employee was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics for smoke inhalation, while no other injuries were reported. Police – assisted by specialist resources – set up multiple crime scenes. Following inquiries, a 66-year-old man was arrested in his home this afternoon. He has been taken to Wyong police station and was yet to be charged. Investigations continue. Albanese on radicalisation of young people online: problem is it ‘often can’t be seen’ Finally, Albanese is asked about reports in several outlets today, including Guardian Australia, that security agencies in the Five Eyes countries – Australia, the US, Britain, Canada and New Zealand – are pleading for their citizens to do more to stop young people falling prey to radical, violent ideologies. Albanese said it was of concern that up to 20% of people being radicalised and potentially engaged in harmful activity are “very young people, some as young as 12”. This is of concern … the problem with radicalisation online is it often can’t be seen. By definition, it can happen in privacy, with someone on a computer screen and we have seen tragically the impact of that, not just here in Australia but around the world. The agencies have chosen to make this announcement today to encourage a vigilance when it comes to these issues because radicalisation online is an issue, it’s one of the things that we’ve had a debate about [with] social media recently and young people having access to it – part of the concern that parents have is not knowing what their sons and daughters are engaged in online. Part of the motivation for the social media ban that was carried, it’s about giving parents more power to have those conversations with the young ones about what is going on online. Albanese on UN vote: ‘the same way the Howard government voted for a long period of time’ Reporters turn to Australia’s UN vote to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”, marking the nation’s return to the position for the first time in more than two decades. Just eight nations including Argentina, Israel and the US, voted against it, while seven others abstained. Albanese: 157 countries voted for that resolution including the Five Eyes partners the United Kingdom, New Zealand, as well as Australia, as well as people who work closely with Germany, Italy, other countries in our region. And it’s exactly the same way that the Howard government voted for a long period of time. Albanese says antisemitism has been ‘on the rise’ Asked if antisemitism is becoming “increasingly aggressive” in Australia, Albanese says it has been around for a “long period of time” but contends it has “been on the rise”. I spoke with Jillian Segal, our antisemitism envoy, this morning as well. We have taken action at providing increased support in security funding for Jewish organisations, we have introduced a landmark ban on the hate symbols … and we’ve got legislation to have Australia’s first National Student Ombudsman to deal with those issues … we will continue to be vigilant on this issue. Questions turn to the attack on a synagogue in Melbourne overnight. The prime minister labels the incident “shocking” and an “attack on Australian values”. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism. It is attacking the rights that Australia should have to practise their faith in peace and security. Albanese says he spoke with the president of the synagogue personally this morning and was told the community engages in peaceful activity and supports one another. This is the heartland of the community. We know that two people were seen, spreading some sort of fluid to encourage a fire and spreading it with brooms and they were seen on CCTV footage and the police will do their job. I spoke with the head of AFP … that federal agencies will be available because it is important. It’s important that these people be held to account for what is a shocking crime. King continued King is asked about comments from the opposition that tying critical mineral projects to community benefits will be taking them “hostage”. She refutes this. The opposition has been critical of the production tax credits incentive really because they want to grab that $17bn to pay for an un-costed, unknown nuclear power policy. We all know that. To try to quote that something around community benefits principles [is] a bad thing is absolutely absurd. Resources minister on critical minerals projects across Australia Minister for resources, Madeleine King, fronts the mic to speak about a further $21m federal government investment in critical minerals projects across the country, also announced today. We need to have governments working together, the federal with the state government, working with the mining industry and that all comes together in our production credits for critical minerals, a $17bn program that will see this kind of industry rocket out of this country and into the region. And it is about time the Coalition and Liberals under Peter Dutton had a good, hard think about what they are going to do to support the resources sector. At the moment they are stepping away from their support of critical minerals and rare earths while this Albanese Labor government is stepping up to support what will be a national, sovereign capability that helps Australians, helps A Future Made in Australia but importantly, helps our whole region in energy security for the future. Albanese announces integrated rare earths refinery in WA The prime minister is speaking now in Perth, decked out in some high-vis, where he is announcing Australia’s first integrated rare earths refinery. The project, to be delivered by Iluka Resources, is expected to support around 900 jobs during construction and 250 when operational. Anthony Albanese: This is so exciting for WA. This project will unlock processing of Australian deposits of light and heavy rare earths. These have critical applications in defence and renewable energy technologies which Australia relies on for our national as well as our economic security, both of those things. The federal government’s funding is contingent on the body “delivering outcomes that will maximise project benefits” for Australia in line with the Future Made in Australia Act. We want to see the benefits of this investment opportunity flow to communities, to workers and to businesses right throughout Australia and this is one of the first – what will be one of the largest announcements – as a direct result. Storms forecast for parts of NSW The New South Wales State Emergency Service (SES) has urged communities to “prepare now” with severe weather and possible flash flooding forecast for the weekend. Storms are forecast to hit the Illawarra, Southern Tablelands, Lower Western, South Coast and Upper Western regions from this afternoon. The front is expected to intensify on Saturday, bringing widespread falls of up to 50mm and localised falls of up to 100mm. Communities expected to be affected are Holbrook, Tumut, Gundagai, Young, Cootamundra, Wagga, the Snowy Mountains and surrounds. NSW SES state duty commander, assistant commissioner Dean Storey, said the SES was prepared for thunderstorms over the next 48 hours but urged people to be across their local forecast and associated warnings. The NSW SES is reminding people to drive to the conditions and not through flash flooding. If you come across a flooded road, stop and find an alternative route because it’s not worth the risk to your life, or the lives of our volunteers. Many thanks to Rafqa Touma for guiding us through the day. I’ll be bringing you all the latest from Adelaide Oval where India have won the toss. Just kidding, there’s another blog for that. Thanks for tuning into today’s live blog. Handing over now to Caitlin Cassidy who will keep you updated with the afternoon’s news. More on housing affordability Renters faced a similar story of woe, with the proportion of income required to meet median rents increasing by 0.3 percentage points over the quarter, meaning tenants now spend about a quarter of their pay on rent. Rental affordability declined in every state and territory except Victoria and Queensland, decreasing Australia-wide by 3.0 percentage points over the past five years and 3.6 percentage points over the past 20 years. NSW remains the most unforgiving state or territory to live as a renter or mortgage holder. Families with an average loan repayment are now spending 58.1% of their income on each instalment, while tenants spend 28.7% of their pay. - Australian Associated Press Worst housing affordability in almost three decades Australian families are spending nearly half of their incomes paying their home loan as housing affordability drops to its worst point in almost three decades. The outlook doesn’t look any better for renters, with tenants now forking over an even higher proportion of their pay for rent. Housing affordability has reached a historic low, and the Real Estate Institute of Australia’s 2024 September quarter report has recorded the “most challenging conditions” since it began monitoring the landscape in 1996. Households across the nation spent 48.6% of their incomes on loan repayments during the September quarter, a 0.4 percentage point increase from the previous three months and 2.9 percentage points over the year. Though there were some improvements in Tasmania and the Northern Territory, housing became less affordable in every other state. The weighted average capital city median house price grew to $1,050,370 after a 0.2% increase during the September quarter and 6.2% growth over the past 12 months. In just five years, housing affordability has declined 16.8 percentage points compared to 12.2 percentage points across the past two decades. “Rising mortgages sizes coupled with stagnant variable interest rates continue to push affordability further out of reach,” institute president Leanne Pilkington said. - Australian Associated Press More to come in the next blog post. Sydney police presence to be ramped up after Melbourne synagogue attack The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has released a statement on the Ripponlea synagogue attack. He says he was “appalled” to hear about the attack at the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne last night and police presence will be ramped up around “key places” in Sydney. We stand in solidarity with our Jewish friends both in Sydney and around the country. Just two weeks ago we had that disgusting night of vandalism in Woollahra. I have spoken to Jewish community leaders this morning and I know NSW Police have also been in contact. NSW Police will be increasing patrols and as well as high visibility taskings around keys places in Sydney. You deserve to feel safe in your own city. If these acts are designed as a campaign of intimidation, they will fail. Santos should be held accountable for terms such as ‘clean energy’ in climate change plan, court hears Santos should be held accountable for its use of terms like “clean energy”, “zero emissions”, “clear and credible” in relation to its climate change strategy, according to the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s (ACCR) final right of reply in its greenwashing case against the gas company. “What matters most is the words that are actually used,” argued Noel Hutley SC, representing ACCR in the federal court on Friday. When Santos released its strategy for net zero emissions by 2040, the company had confidently represented the plan as clear, credible and based on real activities, Hutley said. Our case compares the reality of what occurred in the development of the target with the emphatic quality of the announcement that Santos chose to make. There must be reasonable grounds for the confidence with which a target or a plan is expressed … [given] the confidence with which matters are expressed are apt to influence people. ACCR has consistently argued that Santos misled investors by conveying the impression that gas was “clean energy”, that hydrogen produced from gas was “zero emissions” and that there were “real activities” underpinning the company’s plan for net zero. In contrast, Neil Young KC, representing Santos has argued the company’s climate targets and strategies represented a statement of “present intention” and “not a promise or prediction”. The landmark case, which began on 28 October, was the first to challenge the veracity of a company’s net zero plan, and test whether corporations could be held legally accountable for their climate reports and strategies. ACCR was asking the court to make declarations that Santos had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, and for injunctions prohibiting Santos from engaging in deceptive conduct in future and forcing it to issue a corrective notice about the environmental impacts of its operations. The Hon Justice Brigitte Markovic will deliver the final words in the landmark greenwashing case, when she hands down her decision. Asked if attack was ‘domestic terrorism’, Allan says police ‘aren’t ruling anything out’ The Victorian premier has been pushed on whether today’s act was a “form of domestic terrorism”. She replies “Victoria Police aren’t ruling anything out” and says she has been receiving direct advice from the chief commissioner. I will let those investigations run their course. My advice from Victoria Police … is they’re not ruling anything out at this stage. An attack on a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, so we can absolutely identify that this is an act of antisemitism that we stand here together united to resoundingly condemn. Asked repeatedly if the attack is a sign she has “lost control” of the state, Allan replies: I will take advice from Victoria Police. I will take the advice from the Victoria Police and the chief commissioner who advise me that, in terms of acts of violence, they have the tool and powers to investigate and prosecute people. The press conference then ends after repeated questioning from an individual in the crowd. Allan says focus is on Jewish community, not offenders Asked what her message would be to the offenders, Allan replies there are “many things” she would like to say but her focus is on the Jewish community. My message today, and my focus today, is not on these people who bring violence and hate and evil to the beautiful streets of Melbourne, my focus today is on the Jewish community … who should be in the hearts of every Victorian today. There were people inside … who were praying, who were studying … practising their faith and every Victorian of every faith deserves the right to do that safely, so my thoughts are more with the members of the community … not the people who bring hate. Asked about any personal blame for “not acting on antisemitism properly until now”, Allan says the state government’s focus has been to support members of the Jewish community who are grieving the conflict in the Middle East. Allan says vilification ‘should be a crime’ Allan points to the anti-vilification bill before parliament, which would include vilification into the Crimes Act. It should be a crime and it will give Victoria the strongest powers in the country to clamp and attack this vicious behaviour but also sends a very clear message that there is no place in Victoria, in the strong community that we are as Victorians, for this sort of hateful behaviour. Asked if Victoria will recall state parliament early to consider the bill, she replies “we have committed to use this summer period is a period of consultation”. It won’t be a period of summer holiday for many, it will be a period of consultation on this bill. And can I acknowledge that to date, there has already been extensive consultation with the Jewish community, who have provided support for the bill and where there are ways we can strengthen the bill as a consequence of the feedback, we will, but let’s be clear what we are talking about here today is a criminal offence, it’s a criminal offence, it is a violent attack on a place of worship. I know Victoria police, having spoken over the course of the day to the chief commissioner, are devoting significant resources to this crime. Jacinta Allan pledges $100,000 for synagogue Allan pledges $100,000 for rebuilding work at the synagogue, “guided by the community”, which will “start today”. A stronger police presence will also be placed in the area. The minister for multicultural affairs has also provided $1m in additional security grants for organisations around the state. I’ve been speaking with the chief commissioner over the course of today who has confirmed with me and confirmed with the community that there will be stronger increased police patrols and presence in this part of Melbourne into next week. Allan on synagogue attack: ‘What else is an attack on a synagogue other than an act of antisemitism?’ Allan calls the attack on Adass Israel synagogue in Ripponlea a “hateful, violent attack” on a peaceful place of worship, and echoes the prime minister’s characterisation of the incident as antisemitic. We all stand here today to condemn in the strongest possible terms this hateful violent attack on a beautiful, peaceful place of worship … built by Holocaust survivors who fled that most evil regime in Europe and chose Melbourne and Victoria as their home. Without the contribution of those Holocaust survivors, Victoria just wouldn’t be the strong state it is today … it is an attack on all faiths that I absolutely resoundingly condemn, as do all Victorians in the Victorian community. We condemn this hateful act, this violent act. It was an act of violence as well as an act of hate … what else is an attack on a synagogue other than an act of antisemitism? The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is speaking in Melbourne now alongside members of the Jewish community. I stand here with members of the strong, proud Jewish community that are such an important and beating heart of the city of Melbourne, the state of Victoria and the nation that is Australia, and I thank so many of our community for standing with us here today in what is … one of the toughest times, on one of their darkest days. Victoria’s brown coal hydrogen project closer to a likely demise More than 18 months ago, we reported the near-friendless plan to turn Victoria’s brown coal into hydrogen was all but dead. The problems were multiple. Victorians would have to foot the bill for capturing and storing the inevitably large emissions from converting lignite (brown coal) into hydrogen. The state and federal governments were being asked to stump up multiples of the $50m both had tipped in, and then there was the reluctance for the Japanese partners to commit to more than a few years of buying the costly-to-transport fuel. Well, Japanese media reported about three weeks ago that one of those partners - Kawasaki Heavy Industries - had given up the plan. (Ships might move faster than that news.) In short, KHI, one of Japan’s biggest manufacturers, had given up waiting. The Victorian government initially gave us a general statement only to decide it had no comment, after all. We wondered if Treasurer Tim Pallas was still the only backer in the cabinet, but we’ll have to wait for another time for an answer. We also approached the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain, the group running the project, for a comment. Ellen Sandell, the Victorian Greens leader, said “this disastrous coal project has never stacked up environmentally or economically ... Now the wheels are well and truly falling off”. “It’s time for this project to be scrapped forever,” Sandell said. Given the lack of interest in Melbourne or Canberra to fork out more money for the venture, its fate does look to be sealed, bar the final media release. The family of TV personality Maggie Tabberer have confirmed her death in a post to Instagram. They wrote: This morning we lost our beautiful mother and Nanna. She was an icon in every sense of the word and we will miss her dearly… Along with the rest of Australia.🥰 rest in peace Nanna. We love you to bits forever. AFP and Asio warn of ‘shocking’ numbers of teens in terrorism cases Asio and Australian federal police have revealed that two teenagers aged 16 and 14 have been convicted under Australia’s counter-terrorism laws and warned that “shocking” numbers of their priority cases involve young people. The anonymised details of the two unrelated cases have been published as part of an unprecedented coordinated plea from security agencies in the Five Eyes countries – Australia, the US, Britain, Canada and New Zealand – for their citizens to do more to stop young people falling prey to radical, violent ideologies. “In every one of the terrorist attacks, disruptions and suspected terrorist incidents in Australia this year, the alleged perpetrator was a young person,” Asio’s director general, Mike Burgess, said in a statement accompanying the analysis. Read the full story here: Union says Fair Work hearing over Woolworths warehouse a ‘distraction’ from ongoing dispute As a Fair Work Commission hearing was under way for Woolworths attempting to force United Workers Union (UWU) workers picketing outside warehouses to allow workers to reopen the warehouses and stock increasingly empty shelves in shops across the eastern seaboard, the union has described the action as a “distraction” from the ongoing negotiations. The strike of around 1,500 workers in distribution centres stocking Woolworths has now lasted 16 days, and Woolworths has attempted to re-open one of the warehouses in Victoria using workers from a rival union, but has been prevented by striking workers outside the warehouse. At a press conference in Melbourne on Friday, UWU national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said the Fair Work hearing was a “distraction” and if Woolworths is successful it wouldn’t change anything. If those orders are granted, it doesn’t change the situation, because the collective bargaining dispute and the decision workers have taken under the collective bargaining laws and their right to strike under law continues on until we reach agreement. So in many respects, it’s a pure distraction and a leverage point. Negotiations between Woolworths and the UWU over wages and conditions continue, and Kennedy said, in discussions with Woolworths management, they were beginning to understand the concern from workers around the use of an algorithmic framework that measures worker output by the minute. These warehouses are dangerous places to work in, people get injured in them, they can actually get killed in them, and if you privilege speed over safety, you do a lot of damage and so the nature of this dispute is not purely just about money. It’s about the nature of the work and how people can feel safe and secure to go to work because they’ve only got one body and they also can only do as much as they can, and there is no accountability or transparency or understanding about how these speeds are set, and they’re the things we need to resolve. He said workers were prepared to return to work once an in-principle agreement is made with Woolworths, and workers vote in favour. Australian antimicrobial use significantly higher in affluent areas, study finds The use of antimicrobial drugs in Australia is greater in areas with richer and more highly educated residents, new research suggests. Antimicrobials kill or slow the growth of microbes, and include antibiotics for bacterial infections, antiviral and antifungal drugs. The study, led by researchers at the University of Queensland, looked at the presence of 102 different antimicrobial drugs at 50 wastewater treatment plants across the country, which cover around 50% of the national population. It found that antimicrobial usage was greater in higher-income areas, as well as places where there was a higher proportion of residents attending university or already with a bachelor’s degree or higher level of education. Australia has high rates of antimicrobial use – it ranks in the top 10% for per‐capita antibiotic consumption in the world. Study co-author Dr Jake O’Brien said in a statement: Extensive use may pose a risk for the development of antimicrobial resistance, which is a critical global health challenge projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Responsible use is crucial to prevent antimicrobial resistance, which experts have previously described as a “looming global health crisis” that could make some of most critical drugs to modern medicine ineffective. The five most common antimicrobials or breakdown products, all detected in more than 90% of samples, were amoxicilloic acid, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, sulfapyridine, and sulfamethoxazole. Dutton is asked whether Coalition nuclear plan would be cheaper than renewables Asked whether the Coalition’s nuclear plan would be cheaper than Labor’s renewable plan, opposition leader Peter Dutton said “100% renewables only” will drive up electricity and gas prices and make the electricity network less stable. He spoke at a press conference a short while ago: What we have demonstrated through Frontier Economics, which I think is the most dominant economic model in the country when it comes to energy, is the government’s 100% renewables is not only driving up electricity and gas prices but it is making the electricity network less stable. That’s why we are seeing many factories go offshore. We lose the jobs, we lose the economic productivity, and the government’s policy that Chris Bowen has put together is not costing $122 billion as the government claims, it is now costing more than $550 billion. Some people say that that figure is too conservative and that it could cost over $1 trillion. And there is nothing for free here. People listen to the prime minister and hear him say that the wind is free and the sun is free – why are your power bills going through the roof? Peter Dutton says we are an “essential ally of Israel”. Asked at a press conference a short while ago whether Australia’s UN vote for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories “will mean more terrorism”, the opposition leader said: I think the prime minister needs to give very detailed information of the government’s stance in relation to Israel, as a complete departure from the promise the prime minister made to the Australian Jewish community before the last election. He said he would adopt a bipartisan position, as has been the case for his predecessors. It’s impossible to imagine Bob Hawke or Paul Keating or even Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard would have taken the path that Prime Minister Albanese has. I think it has left our country less safe, I think it has created an air of uncertainty. Peter Dutton on Melbourne synagogue fire: a ‘shocking turn of events’ Opposition leader Peter Dutton addressed the press a short while ago. Speaking about the suspicious fire at a Melbourne synagogue this morning, he said: To see the firebombing of a synagogue, a place of worship, is something that is not welcome and has no place in our country whatsoever. And today we should double down on our support of the Jewish community, who will be feeling this very acutely. Armed guards were protecting kids at Jewish schools this very day and that is unacceptable in our country. There is a lot of work and a lot of leadership that needs to be provided to make sure that people of Jewish faith and people right across the country can be given assurances around safety, basic safety requirements, where people go to a synagogue or they go to another place of worship, when they go to a supermarket, they should do so safely in our country and that has been a very, very sad, shocking turn of events in Melbourne overnight. Elective surgery admissions surge Admissions for elective surgery were the highest on record in 2023-24, data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare today shows. Elective surgeries are procedures that are deemed medically necessary but are planned surgeries and not considered an emergency and, as a result, may be subject to delays While most elective surgeries performed in Australia occur in private hospitals, the AIHW data provides an overview of elective surgeries from public hospital waitlists. It shows cataract extraction was the most common procedure for those admitted from an elective surgery waitlist, accounting for 11% of all intended procedures. The greatest percentage increases in admissions from elective surgery waitlists were for vascular surgery (12% increase compared with 2022-23) and paediatric surgery (8.2% annual average growth since 2019–20). There were 771,600 admissions from public hospital elective surgery waitlists in 2023-24 (excluding the Northern Territory where data is still being collated), a 5% increase from 2022-23. An AIHW spokesperson said the increase in the number of admissions from public hospital elective surgery waitlists follows a period of considerable disruption to the health system as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus on demand side of energy equation Most of the attention of governments – and the media – tends to be on the supply side of the energy equation. We have tended to neglect the demand side, particularly energy efficiency matters, but there’s an emerging understanding that “demand response” will be critical to ensuring grid stability. In short, the spread of devices that can be remotely switched on or off, smart meters that can provide price signal to nudge usage depending on availability of supply, and the decentralising of generation (eg rooftop solar) and batteries, mean the grid is becoming much more flexible. Today, a group of diverse peak bodies – from the AiGroup, Acoss, the Energy Efficiency Council and the Property Council – called on the government to set up a national energy performance agency to give consumers greater clout in the debate. At present, responsibility for managing energy costs is spread across portfolios and governments, and that makes it harder for it to gain bureaucratic or community traction. There should also be national energy performance targets, so progress can be tracked, more representation of those with consumer and demand-side expertise. It sounds a bit arcane and even a bit revolutionary (the Daily Telegraph today took offence at the prospect that air-conditioners might be remotely controlled). The reality, though, is upon us, and for some the prospect of free electricity after an upfront payments might be what they happily choose to take up, as we noted earlier this year: Gosford fires ‘a callous and brazen attack’, NSW police say Police do not yet know the motive behind fires allegedly set in Gosford yesterday. They said at a press conference: At this stage motive is something we are very interested in. It’s obvious there was a reason why the man went to both locations and we are keen to ascertain what the reason is but at this stage we don’t know. This is a callous and brazen attack … It is violent behaviour which as NSW Police we will not tolerate and that is why we established a strike force to investigate the matter and we are putting a lot of resources in the inquiry to bring this to a resolution as quickly as possible. Police deliver update after blast and fires in Gosford NSW police are addressing media after an explosion and fires in Gosford yesterday: We believe this is a targeted attack and not a random incident. Two crime scenes unfolded here on Donnerson Street in the Gosford CBD very quickly yesterday afternoon. The first was in the Legal Aid building where there were reports of an explosion. That building was quickly evacuated and no one there was injured, very fortunately. But as things were unfolding outside the Legal Aid building, police were called two blocks up the street to the building behind me, in the Gosford CBD, where there were reports of a man entering one of the levels of the buildings where there are legal offices located lighting a fire and then as he moved away and made his way outside about 50 people needed to be evacuated. No serious injuries reported from that one as well. One at the other location. I would describe it as a moderate fire that caused moderate internal damage to those premises. That fire was extinguished by Fire and Rescue NSW. At that location, a 54-year-old employee suffered smoke inhalation and was treated at the scene by New South Wales ambulance and did not require any further treatment. Happily, no other person was injured as a result of that could have been an entirely different outcome. Energy ministers gather as peak bodies call for more attention to ‘demand response’ Federal, state and territory energy ministers are gathering in Adelaide today (some are Zooming in) to cap another full-on year for the sector. No doubt summer and the readiness of the grid to cope with heat will come up. As we noted here this week, the Australian Energy Market Operator sees extra renewables and 58% more storage (ie batteries) than a year ago should help. A lot will hinge, though, on the reliability of the ageing coal-fired power plants, a point underlined by last week’s power squeeze in New South Wales. The nation’s biggest coal plant, Origin’s Eraring, was struggling a bit to get all its units back online, for instance, which is why specialists like University of NSW’s Dylan McConnell reckon it’s a “toss of the coin“ whether we’ll get through the summer without some major disruption. Today’s meeting will also discuss what the grid should look like post-2030. Last week federal energy minister Chris Bowen named the panel and terms of reference for the review, as we covered here: There’ll be a media conference and statement after about 2.30pm Aedt that we’ll monitor. In an ABC radio interview, Anthony Albanese spoke at length about the Melbourne synagogue fire. The prime minister said he’d received a briefing from AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw and that counter-terrorism police were involved in the investigation: There are two persons of interest who were there and witnessed, what was witnessed was them using accelerant and then spreading it with a broom, clearly designed to maximise the damage that could occur. Victoria police arson squad,are leading the investigation at this stage. The Melbourne joint counter-terrorism taskforce will be liaising, of course, with Vic pol, and the police will be making a statement later this morning. It’s a terrible morning to awake to this news, which all Australians should unequivocally condemn. This is an outrage. The violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is something that we should never see in Australia. It’s risking lives, it’s clearly aimed at creating fear in the community. Albanese said he’d spoken to Labor MP Josh Burns, who is Jewish, and in whose electorate of Macanamara the Ripponlea synagogue is located. He told me that this is a community that very much revolves around the synagogue. Many Holocaust survivors came from Hungary, in particular after world war two, and it’s been a centre of community activity. It’s a peaceful organisation and community and this attack is just an outrage. One witness treated for hand injury Victoria police say they are aware of one witness who received an injury to his hand at the scene of a suspicious fire at a Melbourne synagogue this morning. Addressing press a short while ago, police said they will increase patrols in the area: I have spoken to local area commander, patrols will be increased. I want the public to be reassured that we’ll do our utmost. Again, I’m here for that reassurance. That is we are taking this seriously. We’ll give the local community what they need and that is we want them to be able to go about their business and pray safely. Police seek security footage from synagogue neighbours More from the police press conference on the suspicious synagogue fire in Melbourne. Police “implore the community” to assist investigators by looking at their own security footage: We want them to identify if around 4.10 they saw two individuals, there may be more, loitering around this area. We’re looking for vehicles, we’re looking for those two individuals. We want some starting points. We know from experience that these investigations get solved through CCTV. We need the community’s help. We implore the community. I know this is not going to be a stretch for the local community here to give us assistance. We know the local community want these people caught as we do. Blaze deliberate and targeted, police say Victoria police believe the fire at a Melbourne synagogue this morning was “deliberate” and “targeted”. The officer in charge of the arson squad is addressing press live in Melbourne: Our first and foremost priority is to identify those individuals that are responsible for this. We believe it was deliberate, we believe it has been targeted. What we don’t know is why. And we will get to the why. I’m here … to give that reassurance to the community that we will do everything we can to bring these individuals before the courts, and to let the community know that we’re going to do our best to make sure that they can return as they should to their local synagogues and do what is absolutely Australian – that is to be able to worship without fear. Masked pair seen ‘spreading an accelerant’, police say Two people in masks were allegedly seen “spreading an accelerant of some type” inside the Melbourne synagogue that was ablaze this morning, Victoria police have said. They are addressing press about the incident, which is being treated as suspicious: At that location, deliberately lit fire was detected. What we do know – a witness who was attending morning prayers has entered the synagogue, and upon entering has seen two individuals who were wearing masks, they appeared to be spreading an accelerant of some type inside the premises. This individual has left. Police were subsequently called to the premises where the premises has been engulfed and has suffered extensive damage. Plea for overhaul of mental healthcare Australia’s mental healthcare system has critical workforce shortages and is increasingly difficult to navigate, the Australian Medical Association say in its position statement on mental health and wellbeing, released today. The AMA calls for all levels of government and non-government organisations to “design and properly fund a mental healthcare system that is patient-centred, needs based, and informed by evidence”. General practitioners are now the frontline for patients with mental illness, AMA president Dr Danielle McMullen says. Mental illness is the No 1 reason for patients visiting their GP, according to Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ Health of the Nation reports. McMullen says: Mental healthcare is already chronically underfunded, but severe workforce shortages and inadequate staffing, the complexity of presentations, and increasing patient loads are further contributing to a system reaching breaking point. It is vital the key areas of the mental health workforce, including psychiatry and general practice, are adequately resourced and structured to be able to provide the best possible care for people who desperately need help. There is a critical need for governments to ensure GPs are properly supported in this role, including investing in longer consultations, GP-led multidisciplinary care and accessible referral pathways. We need all governments to work collaboratively to improve the function, size and distribution of Australia’s mental healthcare workforce to ensure care is available for some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Prime minister Anthony Albanese has condemned a “deliberate, unlawful attack” on a Melbourne synagogue, calling for those responsible to “face the full force of the law”. Albanese is in Perth today, and we’re expecting a media appearance on ABC Melbourne radio shortly. The PM’s office has shared a statement saying: I unequivocally condemn the attack on a Melbourne synagogue early this morning. I have zero tolerance for anti-semitism. It has absolutely no place in Australia. This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage. This attack has risked lives and is clearly aimed at creating fear in the community. The PM said he had been briefed by the AFP commissioner, and offered commonwealth assistance to Victorian authorities: This deliberate, unlawful attack goes against everything we are as Australians and everything we have worked so hard to build as a nation. Asked if Australia’s vote in the UN for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories shows a departure from being allied with Israel, deputy prime minister Richard Marles says: We remain a close friend of Israel. Patricia Karvelas had asked Marles on ABC RN: “The office suggests, representing Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government, that Australia may no longer be a key ally of the Jewish state. How do you see it? Are you a key ally? Or does this show a departure?” She then asked again: “Are you a key ally? Is there a different position? Because that’s how they see it.” Marles: We’re a close friend, and we don’t see that there is any change in our friendship, our relationship, our support for Israel, nor, PK, is there any change in our support for pursuing a two-state solution. That’s been the bipartisan policy of our nation for decades, and the way in which we vote in the United Nations seeks to give expression to that. Deputy prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles rejects the assertion that Australia’s UN vote for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories would invite more terrorism and antisemitism. Patricia Karvelas asked Marles on ABC RN this morning to respond to comments from Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Australian: “It’s been described as disappointing the position Australia has taken, and the vote at the UN would undoubtedly invite more terrorism and more antisemitic riots, including in Australia.” Karvelas asked: “Is that the consequence?” Marles responded: I don’t accept that at all, obviously. All we are doing, as I’ve just said, in expressing our voice in the United Nations, is to support Israel but is also the support a two-state solution and we’ve been doing that over a long period of time, and we do that consistently with other countries in the world who are friends and allies of Australia and so I absolutely don’t accept that proposition. Synagogue fire ‘a deliberate act of violence’, Jason Clare says Federal education minister Jason Clare speculated that the synagogue fire in south Melbourne, being treated as suspicious by police, was not an accident. He told 7 News’ Sunrise program: It’s pretty clear from your reporting that this is no accident, that this is a deliberate act of violence, an attack on a place of worship, and let’s call it out. This is the absolute opposite of what Australia is all about. Liberal frontbencher Sussan Ley said the blaze was “very, very concerning”, adding: It makes me feel quite sick to the stomach. I feel for the Jewish community today waking up to this news. – Australian Associated Press Sixty firefighters called to synagogue blaze Here is more on the Melbourne synagogue fire being treated as suspicious by police, courtesy of Australian Associated Press: About 60 firefighters and 17 trucks were called to the Adass Israel synagogue at Ripponlea in Glen Eira about 4.18am on Friday. Fire Rescue Victoria’s assistant chief fire officer Brayden Sinnamon said the 30m by 20m building was “fully involved” in the fire and the blaze severity had been escalated, with crews using breathing apparatus. He said two people had been evacuated with minor injuries but no other properties were damaged. Anthony Albanese will use his latest trip to Western Australia to announce $21m in funding for critical minerals projects, just days after WA’s government helped sink the federal nature positive laws given concern about its impact on mining and industry. The prime minister will be in Perth for a three-day visit, with the first day being led with a new pledge under the government’s signature Future Made in Australia policy. The cash, for five critical minerals projects, will create up to 400 new jobs, government sources said. The funded projects include $3.8m for a vanadium project in Brisbane, $3m for a graphite refinery in Townsville, $7.4m for a feasibility study into a project in Perth, and $5m for a plant in South Australia. Albanese said: A strong resources sector means a healthy economy and good, well paid local jobs. My Government is committed to supporting the growing critical minerals and rare earths industry. WA is seen as a crucial state for Labor’s bid to retain majority government at the coming federal election. Albanese often boasts of how often he has flown west to visit Perth and mining regions. Guardian Australia understands Albanese intervened to veto a deal on the nature positive legislation, which would have set up a federal environmental protection agency, after lobbying from WA premier Roger Cook and miners. Immigration minister Tony Burke has confirmed that “a bit less than half” the Palestinians who arrived in Australia on tourist visas have been transferred over to humanitarian visas. Burke was on SBS Arabic last night, where he said the cohort had been moved from the 12-month tourist visa they arrived on to the 786 Temporary (Humanitarian Concern) visa, which is valid for three years: And can I say they have been some of the happiest meetings I’ve ever had. The announcement represents a shift in the government’s approach to the cohort of Palestinian refugees who arrived in Australia after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. Until October, the government had only reportedly granted humanitarian visas to just 12 families. Burke said the government had begun to speed up its processing times for the arrivals, subject to the “normal security checks”: People are constantly worried about their 12-month visas, what happens when it runs out. Eventually I’m moving everyone from the protection pathway to the humanitarian pathway, subject to the normal security checks. We have got through a bit less than half the caseload at the moment and we are now starting to speed that up. Everyone is going through all the Asio checks, and the checks you’d want people to go through. We want to give you some security, we want to put you on the same visa the Ukrainians were on, with an understanding that during the life of that visa, we’ll make a decision about resolving your status. Victoria police are investigating a suspicious fire at a synagogue on Glen Eira Avenue in Ripponlea. It is understood the blaze started about 4.10am this morning. No one was injured but the synagogue sustained significant damage, police said. A crime scene has been established and an investigation is under way. And welcome to the live blog. Last night immigration minister Tony Burke told SBS Arabic that Palestinians who arrived in Australia on the 12-month tourist visas have been transferred over to three-year humanitarian visas. Burke said the government had begun to speed up its processing times for the arrivals, subject to normal security checks. Meanwhile, the consultancy firm McKinsey was paid $1.6m over 11 weeks to “inform” and “guide” Australian energy and climate policy, despite its work for the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies. And prime minister Anthony Albanese is en route to Western Australia, where he will announce $21m in funding for critical minerals projects, just days after WA’s government helped sink the federal nature positive laws over concern about their impact on mining and industry. I’ll be rolling your news updates through the day. If there is anything you don’t want us to miss, send it my way on X @At_Raf_"

Enjoy your evenings, whether it be spent watching the Matildas take on Taiwan or anxiously reading our blog on the South Korea crisis. Here were today’s major developments: Australia’s economy put in a disappointing performance in the September quarter. Excluding the Covid disruptions, the annual growth pace of 0.8% was the weakest since the early 1990s recession, according to Westpac. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “the growth in the Australian economy continues to be positive but it is weak”. Commonwealth Bank has conceded it did a “poor job” communicating changes to affected customers, after announcing a partial backdown over its plans to start charging users of one of its popular accounts a $3 fee for accessing money from a branch. The Greens plan to call Murdoch media executives before a Senate inquiry into greenwashing, after paid advertising from the gas lobby appeared as straight news coverage across Murdoch tabloids. They have also announced a new election policy to provide women with free access to contraceptives. The high court has ruled that aggregate sentences do count towards automatic visa cancellation on character grounds, reversing a full federal court decision that resulted in the release of more than 100 people from immigration detention in December 2022. And Australia has voted with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”, marking a return to the position for the first time in more than two decades. Three proposed coalmine projects will remain under assessment for potential approval after the federal government declined to review them for their potential climate impacts. The three projects are Idemitsu’s Boggabri coal project in NSW, BHP Mitsubishi’s Caval Ridge coal project in central Queensland and Jellinbah Group’s Lake Vermont coal project in Queensland. The legal firm Environmental Justice Australia said the mines would result in about 850 million tonnes in greenhouse emissions. The three mines were part of a larger bid - known as the Living Wonders case - by the Environment Council of Central Queensland (ECoCeQ) to have the government reconsider 19 projects because of the climate damage they would cause. The group also ran a series of landmark court cases in which it argued, unsuccessfully, that the minister for the environment was required to consider the lasting climate damage that two different coalmine expansions would cause. Environmental Council of Central Queensland spokesperson Ellie Smith said: This is another blow from the Albanese government, which came to power promising to protect the environment but keeps approving carbon bombs that will supercharge climate change. Environmental Justice Australia senior specialist lawyer Retta Berryman, said: In refusing to change the risk assessment for these massive coalmine expansions, the Albanese government has failed to recognise their climate harms to thousands of animals, plants and places. The peak body for the university sector has blamed a “handbrake on international education” sluggish economy growth figures released today. According to the national accounts, the economy grew 0.3% in the September quarter and 0.8% annually – the weakest non-pandemic reading since the 1990s recession. The ABS reported that education exports fell 9% in the September quarter compared with last year, dropping from $13.6bn to $12.4bn. Universities Australia Ceo, Luke Sheehy: Our economy is stuck in low gear and the handbrake on international education is a big reason for that. International students drove half of Australia’s economic growth last year. It makes no sense to put a handbrake on a $50bn industry that fuels our economy, especially when other sectors are struggling. The government has been using Ministerial Direction 107 to reduce international student numbers since last December and now we are seeing the damaging effects in the data – our outer suburban and regional unis are being hit the hardest. At a time of growing budget pressures, we should be investing in our most successful sectors, not curtailing them. Thunderstorm warning for parts of Queensland and NSW Storms are continuing to hit parts of Queensland and New South Wales, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding is possible in some areas. The BoM holds particular concern for parts of New South Wales, where “very dangerous thunderstorms” are projected to hit Armidale, Glen Innes, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Narrabri and Coonabarabran over the next several hours. 46mm of rain was recorded at Ogunbil (Amaroo) in the half hour to 4.49pm, while Meldrum recorded 44mm in the half hour to 2:44pm. Queensland energy companies’ price changes did not breach competition law, court finds Queensland’s two state owned energy companies “hoped” to cause power price spikes during the summer by making late changes to power prices, but their strategies did not breach competition law, the federal court has found. Justice Sarah Derrington published a judgement on Wednesday in a class action alleging the power companies – CS Energy and Stanwell – took advantage of their market power to prevent other power generators from competing with them. The case scrutinised a practice known as “short notice rebidding”. It involved generators allegedly repricing electricity - at very high prices - that was previously offered to the market at much lower rates. The late timing of the pricing changes allegedly left other generators with little or no time to respond. Justice Derrington found that traders at CS Energy and Stanwell had “hoped that they would be able to cause price spikes over the summer period in accordance with their respective strategies”. In doing so they engaged in “profit-maximising behaviour” but did not unlawfully drive up prices. The Greens have accused Labor of capitulating to big corporations after it neglected requests to consider the climate impacts of three proposed coal mining projects. The ‘reconsideration requests’ were made by the Environment Council of Central Queensland, represented by lawyers from Environmental Justice Australia. On Wednesday, it was revealed government had rejected the requests for Boggabri, Caval Ridge and Lake Vermont Meadowbrook. They now await a final decision by Labor without a prior assessment of their climate harm. Leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said Labor was “doing the bidding” of coal and gas corporations. Emissions are higher under Anthony Albanese than Scott Morrison, Labor has approved 28 new coal and gas projects since coming to power, and the government has pushed setting 2035 climate targets back until after the next election. Scientists say new coal and gas must be stopped to protect Australia from dangerous climate change. Pacific leaders are demanding Australia stop approving new coal and gas to give their islands a fighting chance. Albanese and Tanya Plibersek must immediately reject these three new coal projects. Man, 20, dies in WA after alleged break-in with machete In Western Australia, a 20-year-old man has died after allegedly breaking into a Kalgoorlie-Boulder home armed with a machete, police have confirmed. About 10.15am, police allege the man broke into a home on Kenneally Place armed with the weapon. A man who was at home with his wife and child confronted the man and an altercation ensued, police allege. The 20-year-old received serious injuries and was flown to Royal Perth hospital, where he later died. The male occupant received serious injuries and was sent to Kalgoorlie Regional hospital. This matter is currently still under investigation and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Guardian Australia understands the man was not in custody and was assisting police. No charges have been laid. Chalmers welcomes Commonwealth Bank’s change of heart on withdrawal fees Finally, Chalmers was asked about changes announced by the Commonwealth Bank to impose $3 fees for many customers seeking cash withdrawals. The changes have since been wound back. Jennett: Are you open to having smart ATMs in the regions and a heavier reliance on Australia Post as an alternative to some of those levy proposals that you are working on? Chalmers said he welcomed the Commonwealth Bank’s change of heart and had a conversation with CEO Matt Comyn about the issues. To his credit and to the bank’s credit, they recognise that the changes which were flagged yesterday were neither acceptable nor appropriate … people were doing it tough enough as it is, particularly vulnerable people. We welcome that change of heart. And again, we engage with the major financial institutions in a very respectable, productive and constructive way and that applies to our efforts as well to make sure Australians in regional communities get the kind of services that they need and deserve. That’s an ongoing conversation with the banking sector to see what might be possible here … we have more work to do. Chalmers says aim is to ‘get wages moving again’ Chalmers reiterated Labor’s aim was to “get wages moving again” – both the minimum wage and pay rises in industries dominated by the minimum. Pointed to a $28m deficit for the current financial year, he said the deficit was “much smaller” than anticipated when Labor came to office. How sustainable was continued wage growth? Chalmers: We’ve made progress in this year. We have delivered two surpluses in the first two years. We got the third deficit smaller and the direction of travel compared to what we inherited at the election has been a good one. What we have been able to show from reprioritising in the budget is we can get wages moving again in the care economy and in industries dominated by women. That’s one of the reasons why the gender pay gap is the narrowest it’s ever been … we don’t think people on low incomes or in an industry dominated by women should carry the can for the fight against inflation. Asked whether existing supports like energy bill relief would be extended, he said “I’m not making that argument today” and “it’s not something we’re proposing”. Jim Chalmers: ‘the economy is very soft’ Chalmers was asked whether Labor’s economic settings could be both supportive and inflationary. He replied the Reserve Bank governor had indicated the past two surpluses were helping to fight inflation. We know from the Bureau of Statistics our cost-of-living relief is putting downward pressure on inflation, not upward pressure on inflation. Those are important elements of our economic strategy, to roll out the cost of living relief in the most responsible way we can, to be part of the solution when it comes to inflation … while at the same time we protect jobs in our economy and make sure that we’re not ignoring these risks to growth. When you have economic growth come in lower than what most economists were expecting and forecasting, it makes it more important than ever that, as we maintain the primary focus on inflation, we don’t ignore what’s happening in the economy more broadly and the economy is very soft. Jim Chalmers is asked about ‘insipidly weak’ growth figures The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing now following those less-than-thrilling growth figures released today. Presenter Greg Jennett did not mince his words: By any measure, these growth figures today are insipidly weak … back at budget time, you had growth heading for 2% and still do on the books as we speak. How do you reconcile that? Chalmers replied Labor had taken a “very balanced approach” with a primary focus on reducing inflation. We got a lot of free advice at budget time [that] we should be slashing and burning in the budget and it would have sent the economy backwards at different points of this year. So what we’ve done instead is taken a very balanced approach, and a primary focus on fighting inflation, but without ignoring these very substantial risks to growth. In the last 18 months or so, three quarters of OECD economies have gone backwards. Our economy has continued to grow. It is ticking over but it’s ticking over very slowly. Continued from previous post Shortly after the health minister spoke, Emma Maiden - the general manager of Uniting NSW - criticised the government for inviting Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland in the US state of Oregon - to be the international speaker. Earlier this year, Oregon reintroduced criminal sanctions for drug possession again after decriminalising it in 2020, and Wheeler told the audience the major failure was decriminalising drugs before enough treatment services were in place. Maiden said comparing NSW to Portland was like comparing apples to oranges given the different health systems, and the financial crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the pandemic. She said a European country that has tried decriminalisation, such as Portugal, would have been a better choice. John Brogden, a co-chair of the summit and former leader of the NSW Liberal party, was asked why Wheeler was selected to speak and not a representative closer to NSW such as from the ACT, where possessing small quantities of drugs was decriminalised a year ago. Brogden said: I think [Wheeler] was very honest about what went wrong , without throwing out the idea of decriminalisation. I think we understand the ACT’s experience. The NSW government has ruled out the possibility of decriminalising drugs before its drug summit has finished and despite an overwhelming number of participants at its drug summit calling for it. NSW minister for health, Ryan Park, told reporters with a day and a half of the summit still left to go that it doesn’t have a mandate to decriminalise people possessing small quantities of drugs for personal use. Asked by a reporter if the purpose of the summit was not to determine if there was a mandate, Park said: Where we can find commonalities and agreements, we should focus on that and chart a course to achieving those things. Earlier in the summit there were calls for decriminalisation from Annie Madden, executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, who said for the past 30 years the “best advice” on reducing drug harm had been shunned in favour of the “best compromise”. Park said whilst decriminalisation had come up at the summit, he said many other issues had too. He said this included a need for more treatment services, particularly in the regions, and also “the way we handle people with drugs through the criminal justice system”. Still at the Australian British Chamber of Commerce event in Brisbane, Queensland’s new treasurer, David Janetzki, has warned it is “highly likely” the state government bonds will receive an outlook downgrade. Speaking at the Brisbane event today, the new LNP treasurer blamed the previous Labor government for billion-dollar blowouts in a range of engineering projects. He revealed a major pumped hydro project at Borumba had blown out from $14bn to $18bn. “The former government knew the risk, and they lied to Queenslanders about it,” he said, conceding the state would likely get a downgrade from its double A plus credit rating. What is clear is, it is highly likely that we have inherited an outlook downgrade and ultimately a rating downgrade here in Queensland. It is because of the former government’s economic irresponsibility that we are facing this challenge right now. Before the election, Janetzki vowed to stabilise the state’s books, telling the Australian newspaper: I don’t want to be a treasurer that has a ratings downgrade on my watch. It’s that simple. Queensland energy minister hints at ‘technologically agnostic’ approach to policy Queensland’s energy minister has hinted at a “technologically agnostic” approach to energy – but again ruled out backing his federal LNP counterpart’s nuclear plan. David Janetzki told an Australian British Chamber of Commerce event in Brisbane: In Queensland, we are developing a roadmap for an energy system that is affordable, reliable and sustainable. We will set our own path to achieve this that is pragmatic and technologically agnostic. In a later press conference he denied he was hinting the government would abandon a pre-election pledge to maintain the state’s ban on nuclear energy – but didn’t identify any other alternatives to replace the state’s coal fleet. Update on Commonwealth Bank changes The Commonwealth Bank has provided a further update on changes to legacy account holders, after conceding its announcements had been “poorly communicated”. Group executive of retail banking services, Angus Sullivan, said the changes would not affect around 9 million customers who weren’t on the Complete Access product. The changes taking place are such that the approximately 90% of customers we intend to move, and who we expect will be better off or the same, will be moved to the lower monthly fee account. If those customers don’t want to move, they can contact us to discuss their options. For the remaining customers we are changing our approach and we are pausing the migration. Instead, we will contact these customers over the next six months to discuss the most appropriate product for them given their needs. Commonwealth Bank maintains the largest branch network. Each of our branches has fee free ATMs and we have a moratorium on regional branch closures until at least the end of 2026. Review to be conducted of memoir Gender Queer In October, the federal court ordered the Australian classifications review board to review its assessment of the memoir Gender Queer, following a case launched by activist Bernard Gaynor seeking to have the book refused publication in Australia. He had sought a review of the classification of the graphic novel-style memoir about gender identity by non-binary writer Maia Kobabe on the basis of cartoon images of sex scenes in the book, one of which has been described by critics seeking a ban as “pornographic” and “paedophilic”. Guardian Australia has confirmed the ruling was not appealed and a spokesperson for the communications department said a review will be conducted: The federal court’s decision regarding Gender Queer: A Memoir has not been appealed. The Classification Review Board will conduct a review of the classification of Gender Queer: A Memoir as ordered by the Federal Court of Australia. Timing for the review is being determined. The federal court found that the board review of the submissions on the classification of the book had treated many of them as being anti-LGBTQ, despite the court finding that a majority of those submissions could not be deemed anti-LGBTQ. Tasmania police officer in stable condition after ‘traumatic incident’ in Launceston A male officer injured during a “traumatic incident” in the Launceston CBD yesterday is in a stable condition, Tasmania police have confirmed. Police tried to negotiate with a knife-wielding man in the major Tasmanian city after a member of the public raised the alarm around 10am on Tuesday. Tasmania police’s assistant commissioner, Adrian Bodnar, said the man kept advancing towards officers, who fired several shots which hit him in the chest twice. The man was given first aid at the scene and taken in a critical condition to the Launceston general hospital where he died. The injured officer is currently in a stable condition at the Launceston general hospital after undergoing surgery yesterday, police said. The officer and his family are being supported by the Wellbeing Support team and colleagues, and he is in good spirits. Our thoughts continue to be with all those involved in yesterday’s tragic incident. As is our usual process for any major incident, yesterday’s incident will be subject to a full Professional Standards investigation and also independent review by the Coroner and Integrity Commission. Prahan byelection to be held on 8 February The Victorian parliament’s Speaker, Maree Edwards, has set a date for the Prahran byelection, which was sparked by the resignation of former Greens MP Sam Hibbins. Edwards on Wednesday released a statement confirming it will be held on 8 February. Candidates will have until 17 January to nominate and the electoral roll for voters will close on 27 December. So far, Labor has ruled out running a candidate, while the Greens will run environmental engineer Angelica Di Camillo. Di Camillo was picked by the party to run in Higgins at the next federal election but the Australian Electoral Commission abolished the electorate in a redistribution. The electorate, which covers Prahran, South Yarra and Windsor, has previously been held by both major parties before Hibbins won it in 2014 in a three-way contest that took the Victorian Electoral Commission more than a week to declare. Since then, Hibbins had increased his margin to 12% against the Liberals. He resigned from parliament on 23 November, just three after he quit the Greens due to a “consensual relationship” with a staff member on his team, which was a breach of the party’s rules. As we saw earlier, Australia’s economy put in a disappointing performance in the September quarter. Excluding the Covid disruptions, the annual growth pace of 0.8% was the weakest since the early 1990s recession, according to Westpac. Investors initially reacted by lopping about 0.2 US cents off the value of the Aussie dollar vs the US dollar. The fall, though, has since continued, with the $A down to 64.2 US cents (or about 1% for the day overall), according to Bloomberg data. The dollar’s drop against Japan’s yen isn’t much better, at 0.9% for the day, so it’s not just a greenback thing. It’s only one day, of course, but a weaker currency doesn’t help the inflation fight (since imports get more expensive) but it will help foster local demand. The GDP figures aren’t the only things moving today. South Korea’s martial law flip-flop isn’t a good sign about the stability of Australia’s third-biggest export market (not to mention yet another democracy facing challenges, from the US to France and Germany, among others). We wondered, too, if Nab’s morning read on the overnight global developments might have been a little insensitive. “K-pop” was how they headlined their wrap. Hello everyone. Caitlin Cassidy here, delighted to be with you. That is all from me on the blog today – handing over now to Caitlin Cassidy who will keep you updated with the afternoon’s news. ‘Clear end goal’ is to fully decriminalise and regulate all drugs, Dr Annie Madden says Dr Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, called for decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use at the NSW government’s drug summit. “It is only reasonable that we give decriminalisation a proper chance to do what decades of prohibition has failed to do,” she says. Madden was the only speaker at the state’s first drug summit 25 years ago who was an active drug user. Portland mayor says he would ‘never encourage’ drug decriminalisation without adequate treatment system The mayor of a city in a US state that decriminalised drugs four years ago has told the NSW government’s drug summit that the greatest failure was not having adequate treatment resources in place. Oregon decriminalised drugs in favour of focusing on treatment over punishment after a public vote in 2020. But earlier this year, the city of Portland rolled the laws back and again introduced criminal penalties for drug possession after a spike in drug overdoses. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, told the summit via video call to the audience in Sydney: I would never encourage anybody to go forward with this if they do not have that treatment system in place first. Earlier in the summit there were calls for decriminalisation from Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, who said for the past thirty years the “best advice” on reducing drug harm had been shunned in favour of the “best compromise”. Wheeler said the decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use gave police the power to still issue a maximum $100 fine for those caught. But that fine was waived if the person called a number that connected them with drug treatment resources. He said this “carrot and stick” approach did not work and that the city was overwhelmed by rapid and sharp spikes in overdose calls after drugs were decriminalised. He said that the decriminalisation occurred in the context of a number of inflaming factors. This included the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd which he said had bred a distrust in law enforcement, and also the fentanyl crisis. However, he said “I still think we would have had these problems even if that hadn’t happened.” He added: Even if none of those things had happened, we took way too long to build the treatment infrastructure. ‘Parliament of landlords’ won’t solve housing crisis, says Jordan van den Lamb Van den Lamb said the aim of the campaign is to put up “empty home crime scene” stickers on as many empty homes as possible, so that the extent of the problem is made more visible. The wealthiest people in Australia have enjoyed a massive windfall from the growth in property prices over the past few decades. The system is so rigged for the rich that they often lose very little from keeping properties empty. This needs to change. Labor and the Coalition have together built a housing system in which private profits come before basic human needs. The situation is now reaching a crisis point. Homelessness is growing rapidly as are the number of people on waiting lists for public housing. The initiatives announced by Labor to address this will be a drop in the ocean. We want to build a movement – of the homeless, of renters, of everyone who is suffering from the housing crisis. We can’t expect our parliament of landlords to solve this for us. The majority of them benefit from the current system. People need to take matters into their own hands. ‘Empty home crime scene’: rental activist Jordan van den Lamb launches sticker campaign for vacant properties Rental activist and Victorian Socialists candidate Jordan van den Lamb, AKA Purplepingers, last weekend launched a new campaign leaving large bright stickers on empty rental homes. On Saturday the campaign started visiting homes that have been left empty for an extended period and putting up A3-sized stickers identifying them as an “empty home crime scene”. A recent Prosper Australia report which analysed properties’ water use estimated that there were close to 100,000 vacant homes in Melbourne in 2023 – enough to house more than 250,000 people. That’s many more than are currently homeless or languishing on the public housing waiting list. According to the report, the suburb with the highest concentration of empty homes was Brunswick East, where 1,214 or 12.7% of all properties were left vacant. Gold Coast council votes to progress world heritage cableway proposal The Gold Coast city council has voted to progress plans for a cableway through the world-heritage listed Springbrook national park. Councillors voted 10-5 on Tuesday to spend $500,000 seeking an agreement with the new state government for a route for the long-mooted scheme. The LNP has repeatedly signalled their interest in eco-tourism projects. Opponents argue the project would threaten the national park’s world-heritage status and lacks First Nations consent, among other problems. The Queensland Conservation Council, National Parks Association of Queensland and Gold Coast-based Gecko Environment Council are calling for the scheme to be scrapped. The Greens plan to call Murdoch media executives before a Senate inquiry into greenwashing, after paid advertising from the gas lobby appeared as straight news coverage across Murdoch tabloids. News Corp tabloids the Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun, Courier Mail and Adelaide Advertiser on Monday began an identical week-long series promoting the fossil fuel, with page one headlines warning Australia must “step on the gas” as the “only way to avoid higher bills, blackouts”. In some cases the stories were marked as “exclusive” and a “special report”. Inside the papers ran a double spread that said the series was an advertorial “proudly sponsored” by the gas infrastructure business APA Group and the gas companies Tamboran, Santos and Jemena. “This isn’t journalism – it’s fossil fuel propaganda,” Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for communications and chair of the senate inquiry into greenwashing, said in a statement. She continued: We know that the social licence for coal and gas is rapidly melting as climate change gets worse and the public learn more about who is responsible. We will look to call Murdoch media executives before our Greenwashing inquiry in the new year to explain their disregard for basic journalistic ethics and their longstanding campaign against climate science. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, reacted to today’s growth numbers (which were weaker than expected) a short while ago. He said to press: We have been very clear that you have to get productivity back on track. You have to re-establish the physical guard rails that were in place until the government came into place. You have to make sure that direction, getting redtape out of the way for businesses in Australia to invest and grow and employ, most of all to make sure that we don’t have continued pressure on interest rates and inflation. Dutton accuses PM of selling ‘Jewish community out for green votes’ after Australia votes at UN to end Israeli occupation The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has “sold the Jewish community out for green votes” in response to Australia voting today with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible” for the first time in more than two decades. Dutton was asked at a presser if “that shift [is] something that you support?” earlier today. He said “we should be standing with allies like the United States instead”: It’s not something I support, and we’ve been very critical of the position that the government’s adopted, which has been at odds to the commitments that they gave to the Jewish community before the election … He looked people of Jewish faith in the eye before the election and gave them a guarantee that there would be no difference between the two parties, that there would be bipartisan positions in relation to votes at the UN and our position with regard to Israel. They’ve completely abandoned the Jewish community, the state of Israel. There is a lot of anger, understandably, in the community … and I think the prime minister stands condemned. He sold the Jewish community out for green votes in Western Sydney and places like Marrickville. That is what the prime minister has done and I think we should be standing with allies like the United States instead. The Albanese government is chasing green votes and have been prepared to sacrifice the wellbeing of the Jewish community in Australia to do so. Commonwealth Bank has conceded it did a “poor job” communicating changes to affected customers, after announcing a partial backdown over its plans to start charging users of one of its popular accounts a $3 fee for accessing money from a branch. The changes follow a sharp rebuke from the government, with the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, describing CBA’s plans as a “kick in the guts” and the “worst Christmas present imaginable”. CBA’s group executive of retail banking, Angus Sullivan, said today the bank would pause the planned migration of some customers to the new product that includes “assisted withdrawal fees” for those accessing their cash at a branch, post office or via phone. “Clearly, we’ve done a poor job of communicating aspects of this change for our customers,” Sullivan said. We know that account changes are difficult, and especially at this time of year, and with so many Australians challenged with cost-of-living pressures, we’ve decided to announce a change in our approach. We’re going to pause the changes that we announced, and we’re going to spend the next six months individually engaging with each of those customers to make sure that we have a solution tailored for each one of them. CBA has divided the roughly 1 million customers that have a legacy “complete access” account into two groups – those it believes will be in an equal or better position after the planned migration to the “smart access” product, and those who won’t. This works out to about 900,000 people in the former category, and 100,000 in the latter. The “smart access” account has slightly lower monthly account-keeping fees than the legacy product, but it contains the controversial $3 in-branch withdrawal fees. Sullivan said: The last thing we want to do is disengage or confuse our customers from banking with us, so we’ve taken a different approach. Consumers’ cautious behaviour might be rewarded by the RBA The tale of the September quarter national accounts looks to be one of more tepid growth in the wider economy than had been tipped, with falling commodity prices (pointing to China’s own weak growth) one factor. More reassuring, though, for the Reserve Bank, was that those hefty stage-three tax cuts look to have largely been pocketed by consumers. Disposable income was up 1.5% for the quarter but nominal household spending was up just 0.6%, the ABS said. That helped lift the savings rate from 2.4% to 3.2%. That spending is probably why economists missed on their growth forecasts. It’s a bit of a shell game because households didn’t spend a lot on energy thanks to those state and federal rebates (temporarily culling the veracity of “electricity bills are soaring” stories). Anyway, perhaps the CBA holding out for an RBA rate cut by February might not seem such a lonely prediction after today’s GDP figures (notwithstanding some rosier economic numbers since 30 September). You can follow along at home here too: Disability advocate Hannah Diviney urges media to ‘believe in disabled stories and not just pick one or two’ Diviney concluded her speech by placing an onus on the media to prioritise representation in storytelling. Stories are the building blocks we use to teach children about the world. They’re how we learn to identify the bad guy, or find the hero, without representation in them – what are we supposed to do? That leaves holes in you, not having any representation … to media I say – these holes can be entirely preventable if people with power are brave enough. But it means we need investment from the media. It means we need investment from people behind the scenes, from in front of the camera. We need you to believe in disabled stories and not just pick one or two – whether it is me or Dylan Alcott or Chloe Hayden. There’s a whole diverse range of people out there, and all of us deserve to be heard. But if they’re not filled in, if people aren’t brave enough to prevent those holes, they have no choice but to be filled with the very worst of what a person, in this case, a child, can think about themselves. ‘To us, it’s our quality of life’: Hannah Diviney says NDIS cuts are not just arbitrary figures Diviney, who lives with cerebral palsy, used her speech to rally behind the NDIS and adequate financial care for people with disabilities. She told the room she would not be nearly as successfully functional without the support of crucial early intervention services – an “army” of physios, occupational therapists, speech pathologists and social workers. An army every child and person with a disability should have access to no matter their postcode, financial circumstance, support network, skin colour or immigration status. The size of which, by the way, should not be determined by the arbitrary box-ticking criteria of an inflexible system overseen and executed by people without one iota of lived experience of disabled life among them. Earlier this year, the government cut $14.4bn from the NDIS. To them, that might have just been numbers, arbitrary figures on a piece of paper. To us, it’s our quality of life. It’s whether we get to achieve, it’s whether we get to live, it’s whether we get to be human. With Bill Shorten’s retirement, she said it was her “fervent hope” the incoming NDIS minister would be someone with lived experience with disability. We need better. What [the NDIS] represents now is not how it was meant to be built … you don’t get to make my life or its possibilities smaller to balance a budget. I’m a person, not a surplus tool. Disability advocate Hannah Diviney speaks at National Press Club Meanwhile, author, actor and disability advocate Hannah Diviney has been appearing at the National Press Club to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. Among her many accolades has been encouraging Lizzo and Beyoncé to remove ableist slurs from their lyrics. She noted very few members of the disabled and neurodivergent community had graced the stage in the press club’s history, “which says a lot about the pathways to and construction opportunities for power in this country”. Hi, everyone. I’m Hannah, and when I was born, doctors warned my first-time parents … that in the worst-case scenario, I would never walk, feed myself or talk … If this forum is reflective of the powerful and influential here in Australia, the ones given the capacity to make decisions, shape laws and policy as well as the stories we tell as a nation, the lack of disabled voices included here makes a sad sort of sense. While you were building this, we, as a community, were collectively silenced. Hidden from view. Institutionalised and erased – in fact, in some ways, we still are. Social services minister urges organisations to join abuse redress scheme The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has urged six sporting and religious organisations to reverse their decision to not join the redress scheme “as a priority”. As we reported earlier, the government has named six institutions that have declined to join the national redress scheme, which provides capped compensation and other forms of redress to survivors of abuse. Those organisations are the Darwin Cycling Club, New Norfolk District Football Club, Townsville Indoor Sports, Crown Coaches, Christian Youth Camps, and Knox Basketball Incorporated. Rishworth said: I call on each of these institutions to do the right thing by survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, reverse their decision and join the Scheme as a priority. Joining the Scheme demonstrates an institution’s commitment to survivors at a time when the community is calling for action to end the widespread and unchecked exploitation to children and ongoing trauma for survivors. Survivors have waited too long. I hope each institution reconsiders their decision.If this does occur, their name will be removed from the Scheme’s website. Government names six sporting and religious organisations that refused to join abuse redress scheme Six sporting and religious organisations that have refused to join the National Redress Scheme have been publicly named by the federal government. Earlier this morning, the redress scheme’s website named Christian Youth Camps in Western Australia, Darwin Cycling Club, the New Norfolk District Football Club, Townsville Indoor Sports, Knox Basketball Incorporated and Crown Coaches as the latest organisations to decline to join the redress scheme. The redress scheme was set up after the royal commission to provide capped compensation to abuse survivors. It also facilitates apologies and other forms of redress. The scheme relies heavily on institutions agreeing to sign up, punishing bodies that refuse to do so, including by naming them and barring them from government funding. But a wide range of sporting organisations are yet to sign on to the redress scheme, including the Australian Rugby League Commission. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, is meeting with her state and territory counterparts on the redress ministers board later today. The board will discuss the refusal of sporting organisations to join the redress scheme and the need for states and territories to step in as “funders of last resort” for such bodies. Without a funder of last resort for the sporting organisations, survivors are unable to have their claims for redress progressed. Jim Chalmers has confirmed the Commonwealth Bank has accepted that their plans to charge customers a $3 fee to withdraw money at bank branches “are not acceptable or appropriate,” he said at a presser. Late this morning I spoke to the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Matt Comyn, about the decision announced yesterday by the Commonwealth Bank. As you know, we consider the changes flagged yesterday to be unacceptable, we made our views very clear in the course of the day yesterday. The changes that were flagged and that were announced are not acceptable or appropriate. The Commonwealth Bank has released a statement in the last few minutes which make it very clear that they accept that those changes were not acceptable or appropriate. They will have another look at those changes to make sure that people are not worse off, we are talking and lots of instances about some of the most vulnerable people in the banking system. I welcome the change of heart. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says “the growth in the Australian economy continues to be positive but it is weak”. He is addressing press: Our economy is still growing but very slowly. It is weighed down by interest rates and cost-of-living pressures and global economic uncertainty as well. Growth at just 0.3% in the quarter and 0.8% through the year is below historical averages and it is below market expectations as well. He says the growth in real incomes is “the most encouraging aspect of the data”: The most encouraging aspect and the most important aspect of today’s national accounts is what it says about real incomes growth … Growth in real incomes reflects the progress we are making when it comes to moderating inflation but also solid wages growth and very importantly the government’s cost of living tax cuts. At the intersection of those three things, a moderating inflation, tax cuts and wages growth, that is why we are seeing a real income per capita growing in today’s national accounts, but is very welcome and it is very important as well. The government has updated their Smartraveller advice for South Korea today, urging Australians to “avoid protests and demonstrations”. The website says: The situation in South Korea is evolving due to developments in domestic politics. Avoid protests and demonstrations. Sites like Gwanghwamun Square and Yeouido in Seoul may have larger crowds and more protest activity than usual. Transport and other essential services may be disrupted. Monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. The Australian Embassy in Seoul remains open but is not offering in-person services. This comes after South Korea’s rightwing president was forced to back down after he unexpectedly declared martial law only to face unanimous opposition from the national assembly, in the most serious challenge to the country’s democracy since the 1980s. Apple offers US$1m bounty to researchers who find privacy or security vulnerabilities in AI system One of the big concerns about embedding AI into everything is the potential privacy concerns over what it learns from what people ask AI to do. Apple, which has long set itself as a differentiator based on increased privacy on devices, has tried to put these concerns to rest over its Apple Intelligence in a number of ways. Firstly, it does a fair amount of its processing on-device, meaning it stays on your device and never goes anywhere else. The second part is where it does need to process a request off the device, they’ve introduced Private Cloud Compute, which the company says never stores the data being processed, never trains their AI model from that data, and that data is deleted once no longer required. You can read more about that from the June announcement. The company is now putting its money where its mouth is, and has offered bounties of up to US$1m for researchers – who will have access to components of the source code for the scheme – if they find any privacy or security vulnerabilities in the system. The lowest bounty is set at US$50,000 if a researcher finds accidental or unexpected data disclosure due to a configuration issue. Apple has indicated it is confident that if any such vulnerability was found, it would be publicised quite quickly by researchers who would then get the bounty. The high court has ruled that aggregate sentences do count towards automatic visa cancellation on character grounds, reversing a full federal court decision that resulted in the release of more than 100 people from immigration detention in December 2022. In the Pearson case, the full federal court ruled that aggregate sentences do not trigger automatic visa cancellation, prompting the release of people who had previously served aggregate sentences of 12 months or more in prison. An aggregate sentence refers to when a person is given one sentence for multiple offences. In February 2023 Labor and the Coalition passed an extraordinary law stating that aggregate sentences do qualify for automatic visa cancellation, and that previous cancellations were all taken to be valid. In October 2023, the full federal court upheld the legality of the new law in two cases: JZQQ, a man who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for offences of intentionally causing injury and threats to kill; and Kingston Tapiki, a New Zealander sentenced to an aggregate term of 12 months’ imprisonment for offences of affray and assault. In October the high court heard a challenge by those two and the original plaintiff, Kate Pearson, a New Zealander whose visa was automatically cancelled because she was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of four years and three months in respect of 10 offences. On Wednesday the high court held unanimously that the full federal court got the original decision wrong. As a result, it did not need to judge the validity of the retrospective law. RBA rate cut may be more likely as growth below expectations The quarter-on-quarter figures are more closely watched by economists and the “miss” of 0.3% growth, versus the half percentage point expansion they expected, sent the Australian dollar down against the US counterpart. Investors would now see the RBA as more inclined to cut its cash rate soon (and hence, making it less attractive to hold $A on the margin) after these numbers. The 0.3% pace was the most, though, since the September quarter a year ago, when it grew 0.5%. The year-on-year numbers, too, weren’t flash. At 0.8%, it’s the slowest since the rebound from Covid began, and likely to be the nadir in this part of the cycle (barring some nasty surprise). Australia’s economy quickened in the September quarter, thanks largely to additional government spending, stoking labour demand. Growth, though, was a bit weaker than expected, which may make an early RBA rate cut more likely. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.3% in the July-September months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday. That pace compared with the 0.5% rate expected by economists and the 0.2% growth previously reported for the June quarter by the ABS. GDP was 0.8% larger than for the September quarter a year earlier. Economists had expected annual GDP growth to come in at 1.1% or similar to the 1% rate the ABS had stated for the June quarter. With the swelling population, though, GDP as measured on a per capita basis continued to retreat, easing 0.3%, for a record seventh consecutive quarter. As we noted in the blog yesterday, public demand alone contributed 0.7 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. Still, those outlays have helped kept the unemployment rate to about 4% for all of 2024, a figure not far above the lowest in half a century. Employment in seasonally adjusted terms rose by 156,600 in the September quarter alone. More soon. Drug summit told decriminalisation ‘can be done poorly’ as Portland mayor to speak about recriminalisation More from today’s NSW drug summit. The mayor of the US city of Portland, Ted Wheeler, is due to speak at the summit today after the state of Oregon embarked on a three-year plan to recriminalise drugs after an increase in overdose deaths after they were decriminalised. Madden foreshadowed this by saying there is no “one way to do decriminalisation” and that it can be done well and “it can be done poorly”. Madden also called for a “strong recommendation” on pill testing from the summit, and an end to “harmful policing practices”. She said: We simply cannot go through another summer festival season without access to pill testing, and while we’re at it, without ending the harmful and ineffective policing practices, including strip-searching and the use of drug detection dogs. An advocate at the NSW government’s drug summit has called for decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use with a “clear end goal” of legal regulation of all drugs. Dr Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, was the only speaker at the state’s first drug summit 25 years ago that was an active drug user. This morning, at the state’s second drug summit, she told the audience that in over three decades, the main outcome in drug harm reduction has been that the “best advice” becomes the “best compromise”. “We wonder why we can’t get the results we need,” she said. Madden later added: It is only reasonable that we give decriminalisation a proper chance to do what decades of prohibition has failed to do. But beware, because doing decriminalisation in incremental steps can quickly lead to unintended and unforeseen outcomes as a result of too many compromises. I began with the term full decriminalisation, and for me that includes a clear end goal of full legal regulation of all drugs. More to come in the next blog post. Jacinta Allan says new vaccine facility makes Victoria world-leading centre of medical research The Victorian government has also hailed the opening as marking the state as a leader in medical research. With Moderna and also BioNTech establishing major hubs in the state, the government says it is the only place in the world where both mRNA leaders host research and development, as well as manufacturing operations. The premier, Jacinta Allan, said: There are now three world-leading centres of medical research – Boston, London and Victoria. Moderna mRNA vaccine facility opens in Victoria Australia has become the only country in the southern hemisphere with an mRNA vaccines manufacturing capability after a new facility opened in Victoria, which the health minister hailed as protecting against future pandemics. Early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, experts urged the government to develop domestic mRNA manufacturing capabilities warning Australia would be vulnerable to supply limitations without the ability to produce mRNA vaccines. After those predictions came to pass, the federal and Victorian governments and pharmaceutical giant Moderna struck an agreement in December 2021 to manufacture mRNA vaccines in Australia. The health minister, Mark Butler, and Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, this morning opened Moderna’s facility at Monash University’s Clayton campus which will allow for the growth of Australia’s sovereign mRNA manufacturing industry. The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 100m vaccine doses each year for respiratory diseases including influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Covid-19. Butler: This is a major step forward in helping protect Australians against future pandemics, while creating highly skilled jobs, supporting local industry and promoting research collaboration. The state’s acting minister for economic growth, Danny Pearson, said: We’ll never have to fight to get our fair share of vaccines again because the southern hemisphere’s first end-to-end mRNA vaccine facility has opened in Victoria – setting a new benchmark in innovation and economic growth. Minns says no ‘magic solution’ to drugs but ‘more needs to be done’ The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has opened the Sydney leg of the state’s drug summit by acknowledging there is no “magic solution” to drug use, but that the goal of the summit is to reduce “the number of Australians whose lives have been “destroyed or diminished. He added the government’s “goal is a recognition that society has not got there yet, and more needs to be done.” The summit is the second in the state after one was held in 1999 by then premier Bob Carr. Minns said the summit helped the state recognise drug abuse as a health issue and redirect people away from the justice system towards rehabilitation. This summit, which is on its third day after the first two were held in Griffith and Lismore, has brought together experts from across various fields that intersect with the issue, including medical experts, police, people with lived and living experience, drug user organisations, families, service providers and other stakeholders. The government has said the goal is to hear a range of perspectives and “build consensus on the way NSW deals with drug use and harms”. Minns said: Drugs are a health issue. They’re also a justice issue. They’re a police issue. They can be a child protection and social services issue. They are an education issue. They’re an issue for people that want a safe and sociable neighbourhood. The best hope of lasting change on any question that particularly affects the question like drug policy, is finding points where we agree, and that we can share a common ground. Australia has voted with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”, marking a return to the position for the first time in more than two decades. A total of 157 members, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, voted to support the resolution, while eight, including Argentina, Israel and the US, voted against it. Seven others abstained. Australia’s ambassador to the UN, James Larsen, explained Australia would be supporting the resolution, titled the ‘Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine’, to reflect a desire for the international community “to build momentum towards” achieving a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Larsen said: A two-state solution remains the only hope of breaking the endless cycle of violence, the only hope to see a secure and prosperous future for both peoples. The resolution demands Israel “comply strictly with its obligations under international law”, referring to the ICJ ruling in July this year. It also rejects any attempt at “demographic or territorial change” in the Gaza strip. It also supports a 2025 high-level international conference aimed at devising and implementing a two-state solution. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said while Australia was a “constructive middle power”, it looked to achieve the best outcomes possible at the UN. Wong’s spokesperson said: We don’t always get everything we want. But if, on balance, we believe the resolution will contribute to peace and a two-state solution, we will vote for it. On our own, Australia has few ways to move the dial in the Middle East. Our only hope is working within the international community to push for an end to the cycle of violence and work toward a two-state solution. See more: Two-thirds of over-25s say they feel better about saying no to alcohol than a decade ago Almost two-thirds of Australians over the age of 25 feel more empowered to say no to alcohol than they did 10 years ago, according to new data. Research by Drinkwise points to a shift in attitudes around drinking – the same number, 62%, said they would not feel self-conscious if they chose not to drink when others were drinking. But the data also showed drinkers tend to drink more when they’re not footing the bill – a nod to the Christmas party season that Simon Strahan, CEO at DrinkWise, says highlights the need for workplaces to be mindful of a changing drinking culture, especially given 53% of Australians want to cut back on alcohol. He said the research demonstrates that workers increasingly expect alternatives to alcohol at work functions. We continue to see positive shifts in attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol, with parties and celebrations the main occasion where people alternate between full and lower or zero strength alcohol (71%). This demonstrates a growing awareness of the benefits of more responsible drinking habits. Man charged with alleged assault at Sydney airport A man charged with allegedly assaulting a security officer at Sydney airport is expected to appear in Downing Centre local court today, according to an AFP media release. The man, 27, allegedly forced open an aerobridge door at the international terminal and boarded an aircraft on 28 October 2024. Flight crew members spoke to the man, who then exited the aircraft and allegedly assaulted a security officer, causing him to become unconscious, according to the AFP. The man was arrested and issued with a court attendance notice for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. GDP data likely to show growth rise even as per-capita output extends decline National accounts for the September quarter are out this morning from the ABS, which should signal the economy’s heartbeat is strengthening. Economists have seen most components already – we are two-thirds into the December quarter, after all – so they can pencil in what gross domestic product (GDP) trends roughly look like. They expect GDP growth to have quickened from 0.2% in the June quarter to 0.5% in the July-September period. On an annual basis, growth should come in about 1.1%, marginally better than the June quarter’s 1% pace. (There may be some revisions.) A lot of attention has focused on extra government spending, which the ABS reported yesterday added a chunky 0.7 percentage points to quarterly growth. In other words, without that increase, the economy would have shrunk. Some of that spending looked a bit splurgy. There were federal rebates for energy and even larger ones and other outlays in Queensland and Western Australia as governments in those two states headed for the polls. It didn’t save the Miles Labor government in the sunshine state; WA’s elections are next March. There will be some focus, too, on the likelihood per-capita GDP retreated for a record seventh consecutive quarter. Still, an accelerating overall economy means job openings should remain relatively plentiful for a while. Just don’t expect an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank next week – and perhaps not until May. Look out for the data dump at 11.30am Aedt. Gender divide on nuclear reactors as inquiry heats up Women are strongly opposed to nuclear energy and are most concerned any consideration of the controversial power source will delay the switch to renewables, polling shows. A national survey released today to coincide with a federal inquiry found a stark gender divide, with a mere 26% of women saying nuclear would be good for Australia, compared with 51% of men. But only one in three men surveyed were willing to live near a nuclear plant. Almost two-thirds (63%) of women said they do not want to live near a nuclear plant and more than half (57%) do not think transporting radioactive waste is worth the risk. The DemosAU poll of 6709 adults between 2 July and 24 November also found a higher percentage of men (42%) said they were concerned about the safety of the technology than those who were not concerned. The findings come as a federal inquiry into nuclear power generation is scheduled to hold a public hearing in Melbourne with industry, health and climate witnesses listed to speak. Community leaders, unions and grassroots organisations plan to gather outside to declare “our shared energy future is renewable, not radioactive”. - Australian Associated Press Read more from our own Lisa Cox here: Renewable hydrogen tech could give green light to jobs: CSIRO Making equipment to produce renewable hydrogen could help Australia lead the world in the clean energy resource sector and unlock up to 4,000 jobs and $1.7bn by 2050, a study says. The research, released by CSIRO Futures today, also warned the nation had a small “window of opportunity” to take advantage of its head start before other countries recognised the market’s potential. The findings come weeks after the release of the national hydrogen strategy 2024, which outlined a target to produce 15m tonnes of green hydrogen in Australia annually by 2050. Electrolysers are specialised equipment that use renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, creating hydrogen without producing carbon emissions. Demand for renewable hydrogen was rising worldwide, the study found, as nations sought to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Australia could create $1.7bn in revenue and 3,974 jobs by 2050 if it manufactured hydrogen electrolysers, CSIRO’s hydrogen industry mission leader, Dr Patrick Hartley, said. Installing the equipment could also create another 1,000 jobs, the analysis found, and an additional $1.2bn. - Australian Associated Press More than half of all Australia National University poll respondents lack confidence in Labor As mentioned at the top, a new poll out today has some concerning findings for the Labor government. The study by the Australian National University found that 17.4% of respondents said they had no confidence at all in the federal government; 44.8% had “not very much confidence”; 32.8% “quite a lot” and just 5% “a great deal of confidence”. However, there were some more encouraging pointers for Labor, with more favouring Anthony Albanese as prime minister over Peter Dutton. Here’s the full report: Labor MP says Australians travelling to South Korea should check travel advice MP Stephen Jones has urged Australians to check travel advice to South Korea “given things are moving so rapidly” after the country’s president declared, and then rescinded, martial law overnight. He said on ABC Radio National this morning: [It’s a] very fluid situation over there at the moment. We’re urging Australians to just check in with the travel advice. Clearly, we’ve got concerns about what’s going on over there. Our number one concern is for the safety of Australians who are contemplating a trip over there. Just watch the travel advice is the best advice I can give at this moment, given things are moving so rapidly. There have been no updates to the government’s Smartraveller advice for South Korea since 9 July 2024, which advises to “exercise normal safety precautions in South Korea”. Transport costs still taking 16% of household income over last quarter More on transport costs: The falling price of fuel had a significant impact, the Transport Affordability Index found, reducing transport costs by an average of $338 across all households. But cuts to public transport fares made the biggest impact, forcing down transport prices in Queensland, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Only Queensland’s public transport price cuts were designed to be permanent, however, with fares in other states free on a temporary basis. Despite 50-cent fares up north, Hobart claimed the title of lowest annual transport costs, followed by Darwin, while Sydney, Melbourne and Perth registered the highest costs. Transport costs also fell across seven regional areas surveyed for the index, with transport in Alice Springs, Bunbury and Geelong costing the most at over $23,000 a year, while Townsville and Wagga Wagga registered the cheapest bills at just over $20,000 a year. Even though costs fell in most cities and towns, the Australian Automobile Association’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said transport consumed 16.1% of household income during the quarter and remained a major drain on family budgets. “Transport costs are significantly higher than they were before the (Covid) pandemic,” he said. “The typical Australian household’s transport costs have risen from 13.9% of its income in September 2019 to 16.1% in September 2024.” - Australian Associated Press Deals on the bus go down and down: transport costs plunge The cost of getting around has fallen for the first time in two years, a study has shown, but households in some states are faring better than others thanks to public transport discounts. The Australian Automobile Association detailed the extent of the savings in its Transport Affordability Index today, revealing travel costs fell by an average of $921 a year for those living in capital cities. But Brisbanites were significantly better off than people in other states, saving $3316 a year on average, thanks to the introduction of 50-cent fares for public transport. On the other side of the ledger, Sydneysiders fared the worst, with transport costs rising in the city by $107 a year due to high toll prices, (as Elias Visontay reported earlier in the blog). The report, prepared quarterly by the motoring body, analysed household transport costs including registration, servicing, insurance, car loans, fuel and public transport to determine spending. - Australian Associated Press More to come in the next post. Full Story on Labor’s end-of-year legislation rush Parliament has wrapped for 2024 and politicians are now back in their electorates for the summer. Labor ended the year on a high, striking deals to pass more than 30 pieces of legislation through the Senate in just one day. And while the sitting year is over, speculation is still running hot over when the prime minister will call the federal election. In today’s Full Story podcast, Nour Haydar speaks to chief political correspondent Paul Karp about what the government achieved – and compromised – in the final frenetic sitting day, and what Anthony Albanese could now be weighing up as he decides when voters will head to the polls. The Greens have announced a new election policy to provide women with free access to contraceptives. The policy would mean women would not have to pay out of pocket for oral contraceptives, including more modern pills with fewer side effects, as well as long-acting reversible contraceptives including intrauterine devices (IUDs). Under the policy, the Greens would allocate an ongoing and indexed $250m a year to make medicines regulator approved non-PBS contraceptives free, as well as removing the PBS co-payment to make PBS listed contraceptive methods free. It would also create a contraceptive counselling medicare benefits item. The party’s spokesperson on women, Larissa Waters, says the policy would help “empower women to make decisions about bodily autonomy despite a difficult financial climate”: Our policy would make sure people can access the contraception that works for them, regardless of their bank balance and whether they live in the city, the country, or are studying on a visa. With abortion rights in Queensland potentially under threat it has never been more important to ensure women are able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. More on the new Malaysia-based maritime institute: The government is contributing $1.78m over four years to support the institute, which will train regional government officials on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, broader maritime law and ocean governance, awareness of maritime domains and environmental protection. Wong’s Malaysia visit is part of a short regional tour that also took in Singapore, where she joins the defence minister, Richard Marles, and trade minister, Don Farrell, for annual talks with their Singaporean counterparts. Speaking from Singapore yesterday, Marles acknowledged tensions elsewhere in the region around the Taiwan straits and downplayed the decision of Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-Te, to tour US Pacific territories in a move some criticised as needlessly provocative towards China. He told ABC TV: We don’t want to see any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan straits, and our focus is on doing everything we can in terms of exercising our international voice around promoting stability and peace in and around the Taiwan straits, in and around Taiwan. Australia launches new maritime security educational institute in Malaysia Australia is funding a new Malaysia-based maritime institute to teach officials from around the Indo-Pacific about the international laws of the sea and encourage stability, especially in the South China Sea, where competing territorial claims have seen clashes between China and its neighbours. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, will today launch the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (Ancors) South-east Asia Maritime Institute, to be based on the University of Wollongong’s remote campus in Kuala Lumpur. Rules and norms are vital for our shared maritime region and the countries of our region make an ongoing contribution to maintaining and promoting them. The institute will deliver training to officials from across the region on complex maritime legal and policy topics. It will nurture leaders and help further our collective contribution to a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. More to come in the next post. Anglicare’s executive director, Kasy Chambers, said Australia’s employment system needs to be overhauled to put support ahead of punishment: Australians have heard a lot of rhetoric over the years about full employment and a fair go. But our snapshot shows that the employment system has given up on people who need the most help to find work. These can be people with disabilities, people who didn’t finish year 12, or older workers who lost their jobs later in life. They need entry-level jobs to get a start, but there aren’t enough of these to meet demand in any part of the country. For each entry-level role, there are 33 people looking for work. With such tight numbers, people with barriers to work barely stand a chance. It’s no wonder that many are long-term unemployed. Each year, we find that the same people are being left behind by the job market Same people locked out of job market every year: Anglicare Australia Anglicare Australia is today releasing its annual jobs availability snapshot, which shows that the job market has been locking the same people out of work every year. The snapshot measures how many jobs are available for people who don’t have qualifications or work experience. It found: For every entry-level job, there are 33 people out of work. The situation is worst in the NT, where there are 65 people for every job, followed by Tasmania where there are 50. Around two-thirds (62%) of people out of work are long-term unemployed. These Australians spend almost four years looking for work. Thank you to Martin Farrer for kicking off the blog this morning. I’ll be taking it for the day – if there is anything you don’t want the blog to miss, send it my way on X @At_Raf_ More on that Cbus report from AAP: Paddy Crumlin, the former CFMEU ACT president Jason O’Mara, and the CFMEU’s legal director, Lucy Weber, were reassessed against both the fund’s former “fit and proper person” test and a more stringent one recommended by the review authors, Deloitte. All passed, as did sitting board members. “Cbus will now work with Deloitte, as required by the licence conditions, to develop an action plan to address each of the recommendations in the review to be approved by APRA,” Cbus said in a statement, referring to the financial regulator. The fund in recent years has swallowed smaller industry funds for media, energy and electrical workers, increasing its membership by 10% to 900,000 members. It is the seventh-largest industry super fund by total funds under management and the 10th-largest overall. The CFMEU’s construction arm was placed into administration in August after allegations of criminal conduct and organised crime links on job sites. The Fair Work Ombudsman is conducting more than 40 investigations into the building and construction industry involving most CFMEU branches across Australia, as well as its officials and employers. A super fund heavyweight’s partnerships with the embattled construction union CFMEU may not have been in the best interests of its 900,000 members, a review has concluded, according to the Australian Associated Press. Cbus, which is chaired by former treasurer Wayne Swan, released an independent review of its governance and board members yesterday, instigated amid heavy scrutiny of the CFMEU’s construction arm. The fund accepted all 26 recommendations, including overhauling how it decides and documents extensive payments to the union. Nearly $1m in payments were made to the union’s various branches in the past financial year, including for rental of premises in Geelong and Perth and cross promotions. But the review found evaluation of the partnership was dominated by informal processes, including spoken feedback. It says: This is not to question intent or whether ultimately decisions are in the best financial interests of members or not. It’s just that the documentation, systems and processes do not allow for that decision to be concluded clearly. But it cleared the appointments of union-linked board members, including the CFMEU national president, Paddy Crumlin. Sydney the only city paying higher transport costs over last quarter Transport costs have eased for all Australians – except for Sydneysiders – as falling fuel prices and cheaper public transport fares combined with rising wages. Typical Australian household spending on transport declined by 2.6% in the September quarter, the largest decrease in transport inflation since 2017, despite the broader measure of inflation across society (the consumer price index) climbing by 0.2% in the quarter. Analysis of transport affordability, produced by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), found that the consumer relief was driven by an average $338 reduction in a typical household’s fuel bill, coupled with cuts to public transport ticket costs. This includes temporary free transport offers in Canberra and Darwin, as well as Queensland blanket 50c fares which were introduced in August but have since become permanent. However Sydney bucked the trend as the only location in the country where household spending on transport rose. This was because higher toll road charges, which have annual increases baked in, offset the benefits of cheaper fuel. Brisbane’s annualised typical household transport costs dropped by $3,316, or 12.5%; Canberra’s by $1,799, or 7.2%; and Darwin’s by $1,416, or 6%. Across the five other state capitals, the average change in transport costs was only 0.7%. AAA’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said transport costs were still significantly higher than before the pandemic, with a typical household’s costs rising from 13.9% of its income in September 2019 to 16.1% in September 2024. Bradley said: Transport is a significant and unavoidable expense, and rising transport expenditure is also one of the key drivers of inflation. Governments at all levels must consider these cost pressures when formulating policy. Almost five decades on from the “gruesome” and “brutal” alleged murder of two women in their home, a suspect in the investigation into the frenzied stabbings has touched down in Australia, Australian Associated Press reports. Perry Kouroumblis landed in Melbourne late on Tuesday night after being extradited from Italy, marking the first time in about eight years he has stepped foot on Australian soil. Police were set to interview Kouroumblis on Wednesday and he was expected to face Melbourne magistrates court later in the day. Victoria police said in a statement that he will formally be charged with two counts of murder and one count of rape during this court appearance. He maintains his innocence. He was arrested at Rome’s Leonardo Da Vinci airport in September in connection to the alleged killing of Suzanne Armstrong, 28, and Susan Bartlett, 27, in January 1977. Dubbed the “Easey Street murders”, the friends were found dead with more than two dozen stab wounds in their home on Easey Street in Collingwood in Melbourne’s inner north. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories after which Rafqa Touma will be your host. Cbus, the super fund heavyweight chaired by former treasurer Wayne Swan, has released an independent review of its governance and board members which concludes that partnerships with the CFMEU’s construction arm may not have been in the best interests of its members. More details coming up. A day after our Essential poll revealed voters thought the government had done poorly on the key issues of housing affordability and wages, a new survey shows support for federal Labor is at Scott Morrison-type low levels, with no more than six months before the next election. We have the details, plus today’s Full Story podcast looking at the state of play in Canberra. The man wanted for questioning by police over the Easey Street murders in 1977 has landed in Melbourne overnight. Perry Kouroumblis, 65, a Greek Australian, has been extradited from Italy to face questioning by police today over the alleged killings of Suzanne Armstrong and Susan Bartlett in Melbourne. He maintains his innocence. More coming up. And there’s good news for commuters – transport costs have seen their biggest fall in years. Everywhere except for one city, that is. More on that soon."

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. Over the past few days, you may have been wondering why a neon pink tank has been following you round the internet. Relax: this isn’t an algorithm judging your taste and predicting your next purchase. It isn’t a tank, either. It is a Jaguar Type 00, it is the subject of an unholy quantity of media coverage, and it may be a vision of the electric future. Or: it may be a sharp bit of marketing whose weirdest features will never make it to the cars Jaguar actually sells. Either way, it’s a story with a lot to tell us about how the rush for electric is changing the car industry. For today’s newsletter, Jasper Jolly, who covers the automotive industry for the Guardian, explains why. In depth: ‘The idea of a car being woke is strange – it’s a status symbol about wealth’ The first sign that Type 00 discourse might become a problem was the appearance of a teaser video online before the launch itself. The “copy nothing” campaign, which featured a group of stern-faced models in fluorescent outfits getting out of a lift on what I suspect to be Mars, was celebrated by Jaguar’s managing director, Rawdon Glover, as a way to “move away from traditional automotive stereotypes”, presumably because there weren’t any cars in it. Weird car guys and their fellow travellers, meanwhile, lost their minds about it being “woke”. Nigel Farage said Jaguar deserved to go bust; Andrew Tate called it “gay bullshit”; Giles Coren has written about it three times now. Whether any of the players actually mean any of what they say or care about it for reasons beyond their personal brand is another question. To everyone else, it just looked like a totally generic bit of marketing guff; ironically enough, “copy nothing” seems pretty derivative of Apple’s old “think different” campaign, among about a million other familiar reference points. (“Delete ordinary,” Jaguar also said. “Go bold. Braindump spacecar.” OK, I made one of those up.) Anyway, then the car itself appeared, and you will not believe this but it was pink!!! People on TikTok hated it, the Daily Mail reported. But if this is really a car for the woke mob, the £100,000 tag on the road version being released in 2026 seems like quite an improbable price point. (Also, it doesn’t really scan that it would look so much like Elon Musk’s hideous and extremely anti-woke Cybertruck.) “The idea of a car being woke is quite strange to me,” Jasper Jolly said. “This kind of car, especially, is a status symbol about wealth. That is the market that Jaguar is interested in.” *** What is a concept car, anyway? In theory, a concept car is a vision of the future: a way to test out radical styling or technological advances outside the confines of competitively priced mass production. They drive the technology forwards, the rationale goes, whether they work out or not. (Although it is a shame that the Plymouth Voyager III, which briefly appeared in 1990, didn’t lead to us all driving cars with a detachable minibus for the family at the back.) In reality, of course, they are above all marketing exercises, and a way for car salesmen to feel a bit like Steve Jobs when they get on stage at the product launch. If the features that attract the coverage never make it to the road, who cares? “They try to be as ambitious as possible, then they retreat a bit in the versions that they actually sell,” Jasper said. “The extent of the retreat is different for each brand. My sense here is that a lot of it will end up in the production version.” Those have already been tested, wrapped in hilariously cloak-and-dagger black-and-white wrapping paper to disguise what it will look like, but it appears to be the same sort of thing with four doors instead of two. Even so, the road version of this one is unlikely to feature a “travertine” (a type of limestone, apparently) plinth or a brass spine down the middle. You may also have options other than electric blue or pink. *** Why does this one look like it belongs to Fascist Dystopian Barbie? Look, it’s not for me, and nobody cares about that. But it’s also not for the ageing market that buys Jaguars in ever smaller numbers, and Jaguar Land Rover care about that very much indeed. The problem, said Jasper, is that “when people talk about classic Jaguars, they talk about the E-Type – but that car is a symbol of the 60s. The other image that comes up again and again is Inspector Morse driving his Jaguar – you can’t get much further from the market that they are hoping to reach.” The slightly sinister phrase for the desired shift is from “a legacy automotive brand” to “a pure luxury brand”: basically, if you can remember what they used to look like, they would rather not hear from you. “This is not a depiction of how we think our future customers are,” Glover told the FT. “We don’t want to necessarily leave all of our customers behind. But we do need to attract a new customer base.” For a sense of who that might be, ask yourself where you tend to see cars like this – gigantic things that make you feel more powerful than the losers on the pavement because they’d barely dent the bonnet if you ran them over. The answer tends to be in the interchangeable luxury districts of cities like London, Paris and Dubai, where the supercars are 10 a penny (and, generally, attracting parking fines or stuck in traffic rather than purring along the open road). “They’ve already said their first showroom [actually, they call them ‘brand stores’] is going to be in the Paris fashion district,” Jasper said. “Yes, they’re going for a younger person, but it’s not a ‘woke’ younger person. And it’s not that young – in luxury car terms, ‘young’ is your 30s or 40s. It’s an international moneyed elite, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they’re thinking about tech entrepreneurs or people with inherited wealth.” As Jeff Dodds, former marketing director of Honda, grimly puts it in this roundup of reaction: “Inspector Morse wouldn’t go near it, but if his grandson has just launched a cybersecurity startup then he might.” *** What does the Type 00 tell us about the market for electric cars? I hate to break this to you, but while the Jaguar press release claims that it decided to make its new cars look so funny because they are a “fearlessly creative” tribute to “the DNA of the brand”, it’s mostly because everyone has stopped buying the old ones – even, for the most part, the classic car enthusiasts who have been popping off on the internet about it. As Jasper points out in this excellent analysis piece, sales have fallen from 180,000 in 2018 to fewer than 67,000 in 2023. (It has now stopped selling new ones altogether.) It may therefore make sense to completely reinvent the brand. What’s interesting about this is the fact that the transition to electric provides such an ideal moment to do it – when people expect cars to be a bit different anyway, and may be more open-minded about what they buy than they have been in the past. “You’ve seen a slew of Chinese carmakers coming into the industry in the UK, for example, and they’re establishing a foothold that would have been very difficult for them in the past,” Jasper said. China now has a remarkable 76% of the global market. The other reason for this: electric cars are just … a bit more similar than the petrol kind. “In the past, a Jaguar ad would have been all about what power comes out of the engine,” Jasper said. “All that is absent from what they’re saying here – the only kind of technical aspect anyone cares about is range. So they have to differentiate themselves in other ways.” The natural conclusion of this is the line in the Jaguar marketing guff that describes the car as a “physical manifestation” of the brand, perhaps in the same way that a loaf of bread is a physical manifestation of Hovis, and my face right now is a physical manifestation of the rolling eyes emoji. And if Jaguar can sell enough brand physical manifestations when they finally put them on the market, all the mockery will have been thoroughly worth it.

Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad For Muslims, Friday prayers, or Jummah, have always been a time to dress your best – and a new exhibition looks at what that means today, for British Muslim men of all generations. Dr Fatima Rajina, a sociologist, and Rehan Jamil, a social documentary photographer, spent the last eight months documenting Muslim men’s fashion choices. Their project has culminated in an exhibition in Oxford House, Bethnal Green, east London, called Jummah Aesthetics: British Muslim Men and Their Sartorial Choices. Rajina and Jamil discovered an eclectic mix of styles, as well as some clear trends. There were obvious generational differences, for example – older men were more likely to don bright, colourful garb, while younger men often opted for navy, blue and grey. Rajina says she hopes to change the way Muslim men are viewed by academia, as a lot of research is focused on radicalisation. Jamil says: “Fashion is such a great medium for storytelling, and this kind of visibility could foster mutual appreciation and understanding between different communities.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

The won has fallen to a two-year low today, as traders react to president Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning decision to challenge the left-wing parliamentary group that controls the national assembly, by banning political activity. Shares in South Korean ETFs tumbled, while Samsung’s stock fell over 5% in London. Here’s the latest: The worrying news from Seoul took the shine off a rally in European stocks today, where the FTSE 100 is on track for a six-week closing high. In Germany, the DAX index climbed over the 20,000 point mark for the first time, sparking talk that a Santa Rally may be taking off in Europe. In London, anti-Barclays protesters have gathered at a banking summit…. ….where its former CEO accused the UK government of a “get those fuckers” attitude towards bankers. Luxury carmaker Jaguar has unveiled its much-anticipated concept electric car, to a better reception than it may have feared. The boss of the Japanese bank Nomura has apologised and taken a voluntary pay cut after a former employee was charged with robbery and attempted murder of a customer. Labour will miss its manifesto target of building 1.5m homes in England before the end of this parliament without more radical reform to the planning system, the thinktank the Centre for Cities has warned. The Office for National Statistics has conceded it may not be ready to replace its defective employment survey with a more accurate series until 2027, despite complaints from policymakers about the quality of the existing data. Exports of British food to the EU have dropped by nearly £3bn a year since Brexit, a trade thinktank has said, with new physical and documentary checks at the border complicating trade. South Korea’s finance minister has declared that the government will deploy all possible measures to stabilize financial markets if needed. Following an emergency meeting with top economic officials in Seoul, Choi Sang-mok said: “We will mobilize all possible financial and foreign exchange market stabilization measures, including unlimited liquidity injections.” Back in London, ex-Barclays CEO Bob Diamond says one of the reasons that UK banks are struggling compared to their US counterparts, is that the UK government doled out “biblical justice” in response to the 2008 financial crisis. This, he says, resulted in a “get those fuckers” attitude towards bankers. Diamond said the US had a relatively pragmatic response to the crisis, which amounted to three rules: one, that the banks had to repay their government bailouts; two, that they couldn’t repay those government debts until they passed stress tests; and three, until they repaid the government, those banks could not pay bonuses to bankers or dividends to shareholders. Across the pond, it was a very different story. Diamond told the FT Banking Summit: “In the UK and in Europe, it was biblical justice: ‘Let’s get those fuckers. Let’s get those banks. Let’s really hurt them’. “And I think the result of that has been very, very apparent, which is Royal Bank of Scotland is still owned by the government, and Barclays is still under pressure because they didn’t take money from the government. So my view is it was very, very different in the US than it was in the UK and Europe. And I think the US economy has been a beneficiary.” South Korea’s martial law commander Park An-su has declared that all political activities are banned, and all media will be subject to government monitoring. The Yonhap News Agency is reporting that members of the national assembly have been banned from entering the building, with the South Korean military having reportedly announced the suspension of all parliamentary activity. Our liveblog has more details: Great Britain’s energy generators were called on to ramp up their electricity output after the energy system operator warned that the country faced an energy supply crunch this evening, before dropping the warning. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) triggered an official warning over Britain’s power supplies shortly after lunchtime on Tuesday, just hours before an expected squeeze on the country’s electricity forecast for 17.30pm (as covered earlier). It later removed the warning notice saying it had “enough electricity generation to meet demand and continue to operate the system as normal”. Power supplies were expected to be tight due to a drop in wind power generation which has coincided with higher demand due to the cold snap. In the early afternoon wind power contributed just 7% to the UK’s electricity supplies, while gas-fired power plants made up 55% of all power generation, according to Neso data. As a result by the early evening Britain’s electricity supplies were expected to be less than 1% above the forecast peak in power demand. This is well below the threshold set out in market rules to operate the power system safely. Neso raised a red flag weeks after predicting that the risk of winter blackouts in Great Britain had tumbled to its lowest in four years – even after the shutdown of the UK’s last coal plant, thanks to investments in low-carbon electricity sources. In its winter outlook report Neso said it expects Britain’s winter power supplies to outstrip demand by almost 9% this year in its base case scenario, the greatest margin since the winter of 2019 to 2020. The capacity market notice is intended to spur generators to step in to sell electricity to the grid at short notice, often for lucrative fees, or encourage companies that use energy to reduce their demand in return for payments. New York-listed shares in South Korean companies have also dropped. POSCO, the South Korean steel manufacturer, are down 7% on Wall Street. Telecoms giant KT Corp are down 3.8% in New York. Exchange traded funds which track South Korean shares are also falling sharply. The MSCI South Korea ETF is down 5.1%, while the Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF has dropped by 3.9%. London-listed depository receipts in South Korean tech giant Samsung have tumbled by 5.4%, Reuters reports. Those depositary receipts are financial instruments that represents shares of a foreign company that are traded on a local stock exchange. It’s a sign that stocks on the South Korean stock market may fall sharply when trading resumes on Wednesday. The South Korean currency has fallen to as low as 1,430 won to the dollar, the lowest since late October 2022. That’s a drop of over 1.8% today. Newsflash: the South Korean won has dropped to a two year low after the country’s president stunned citizens by declarinig martial law is in place. In an unannounced late night TV broadcast, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared he would eradicate “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces”. Reuters reports that he did not cite any specific threat from the nuclear-armed North, however, instead focusing on his domestic political opponents instead. Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, insisting: “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.” Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, which has the majority in parliament, warned in response that “The economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably”, adding: “My fellow citizens, please come to the National Assembly.” Britain’s power supply margins could fall below target tonight, partly due to low wind speeds hitting renewable power generation. The National Energy System Operator has reported that the country’s electricity supply margin could drop below the threshold set out in its capacity market rules by 1730 GMT on Tuesday. Under the capacity market scheme, generators are paid to make sure power generation is available at times when demand is high. National Grid’s Electricity System Operator said on its website that expected aggregate capacity was 47,166 megawatts (MW), compared with a transmission demand and operating margin of 46,717 MW. ESO added: “No definitive information regarding additional capacity is currently available to the Electricity System Operator.” Currently, wind is only providing 14.5% of the UK’s power generration, with over half coming from gas. France’s risk premium against Germany has narrowed today, even though Michel Barnier’s government may collapse tomorrow. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year French bonds has dipped very slightly today, to 2.91%, while the yield on the German equivalent has risen slightly, to 2.05%. That narrows France’s debt premium over Germany, which hit a 12-year high last week. That’s despite the likelihood that Barnier loses a no-confidence vote tomorrow, over his decision to force the social security budget through parliament. The CEO of BBVA says he has not yet decided whether he will sell UK high street lender TSB if his bank succeeds in its $13bn hostile takeover of rival and TSB owner Sabadell. Onur Genc told the FT Banking Summit that he was “neutral” about whether to keep TSB in any future combined banking group: “We have to see once we complete the deal.” He insisted that his main focus is on bolstering its operations across Spain. “Local scale is important and that’s why we are doing the deal” Last week, the European Commission said it did not have any objections to the takeover of Sabadell – the Spanish lender that was created in 1881 by 127 families in Catalonia – after completing a foreign subsidies review.However, the bid still faces a longer antitrust review by Spain’s competition watchdog, the CNMC, that could extend the process well into next year. A sale of TSB would mark the third major ownership change for the UK bank, which was hived off from Lloyds in 2013 as part of efforts to boost competition following its £20.3bn government bailout in 2008. TSB returned as a standalone high street bank nearly 20 years after it was snapped up by Lloyds in 1995. Led by chief executive Paul Pester, the new TSB spanned 631 branches and boasted 8,500 staff. It eventually floated on the UK stock exchange in 2014, but was bought by Sabadell a year later, marking one of the biggest cross-border banking deals since the financial crisis. Sabadell explored a potential sale of the bank in 2020 but later abandoned those plans, even as it continued to nurse the fallout of a major IT meltdown in 2018. The oil price is also rallying today, but Opec+ – rather than Santa – is responsible. The oil producers’ cartel and its allies are due to meet on Thursday, and is expected to extend its latest round of oil output cuts until the end of the first quarter. Opec+ had been hoping to unwind its recent output cuts, but is rethinking that plan as global demand slows, and output rises among non-Opec members. Brent crude is up 1%, or 70 cents per barrel, at $72.55/barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: Elevated interest rates, a strong US dollar, and weak global economic growth are weighing on the oil market from the demand side of things. On the supply side, with US output already at record levels in 2024, the risk of market oversupply looms unless global growth picks up or OPEC+ implements significant production cuts. Adding to the uncertainty, speculation around a potential second Trump term has fuelled expectations of higher US oil production. This makes the OPEC’s job quite tough, complicating the crude oil forecast: does it want to achieve higher oil prices but lose market share to US shale producers, or allow oil prices to fall to potentially support demand? Well, according to Reuters, the OPEC+ is reportedly considering postponing the planned production hike for January, something which is now the base case scenario for many oil analysts. This decision, tied to resolving issues like the UAE’s agreed production increase for 2025, is expected to be finalized at the December 5 meeting. However, a substantial delay will be necessary to meaningfully support prices; otherwise, oil could quickly resume its downward trajectory amid persistent macroeconomic pressures. Barclays CEO CS Venkatakrishnan says banks have to be alive to potential risks when working with firms in the shadow banking sector, including private equity houses and private credit providers. Regulated lenders like Barclays have been trying to ensure they don’t miss out on the financial successes of the less regulated non-bank financial institutions. But Venkatakrishan said banks have to be aware of the activities of companies they lend to, and be careful about how concentrated their operations are. Speaking at the FT Banking Summit this morning, he said: “Absolutey it’s a risk…you have to be careful.” That means screening those firms in the same way they would any other client, he explained: “Whether we deal with private credit funds or private equity funds or we deal with industrial companies, you’ve got to understand the business they’re in. Decide how much you’re still willing to lend to them. Make sure you’ve got good collateral. Ensure you monitor it. Make sure you understand the ins and outs, choose your clients carefully. That’s the basics of banking. That’s what we should have been doing, and should do, for the last couple of 100 years, and the next couple of 100 years. Those things don’t change.” His comments come just days after the Bank of England released the results of their first stress test into the shadow banking sector. It found that hedge funds, pension funds and other companies in the largely unregulated sector were at risk of amplifying market shocks and triggering a £17bn asset sell-off. It seems that equity traders are not that concerned about Trump’s tariff policies, suggests Charalampos Pissouros, senior market analyst at XM: They may even feel confident that, if he is sticking to his tariff pledges, he will be similarly determined to proceed with the massive tax cuts as well. With regards to a potential Fed pause [to US interest rates], given that equity traders are longer-term investors than forex participants, they may not care that much about delayed rate cuts, as long as the rate path remains to the downside. Recent analysis from Nutmeg, the digital wealth manager owned by J.P. Morgan, shows that the Santa Rally is stronger in the City than in other markets. The FTSE 100 share index has delivered positive returns in December more often than its peer group, and has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and Japan Index during December. Pacome Breton, head of portfolio management at J.P. Morgan owned digital wealth manager, Nutmeg, said: “While the Santa Rally has been an attractive theory for investors to believe in over the last few years, and there is some logic to this belief, it is clear from the data that market performance in December can be volatile.” But Breton warns that after a strong November, following Donald Trump’s election win, December could be quieter across markets, “as investors take a deeper look at what 2025 could bring for central banks, geopolitics and the future of the world’s largest economy.” Here’s the moment the German DAX share index hit a new all-time high this morning, hitting 20,000 points for the first time: The rally means the DAX has now risen by around 3,000 points over the course of 2024, after cracking the 17,000-point mark in December 2023. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: December is here, and while the famed “Santa rally” doesn’t typically kick in until Christmas week, this remains the most likely month for market gains. For US markets, positive economic data - including strong manufacturing and consumer spending - helped kick things off yesterday evening, though rising yields and tariff uncertainty kept investors on edge. Large-cap techs led the charge, but geopolitical tensions and the new US administration are shaping up to be the real drivers in the weeks ahead. A Santa rally may be building in Europe’s financial markets today, despite worries about the economic outlook and political instability in France and Germany. In London, the FTSE 100 share index has risen to a six-week high this morning, up 56 points or 0.7% at 8369 points. Budget airline easyJet is the top riser (+4%), after a stock upgrade from UBS, with mining company Antofagasta (+2.3%) and banks Barclays (+1.9%) and NatWest (+1.8%) not far behind. In Berlin, Germany’s benchmark DAX stock index has broken through the 20,000-point barrier for the first time, despite the recent government collapse that has led to a new election being called for next February. Paris’s CAC 40 has gained 0.6% today; risers include luxury goods makers Hermes and LVMH, on hopes of more stimulus measures in China. Europe’s gains follow a strong day on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq finished at new all-time closing highs last night. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: December is Santa rally territory and so far, it’s got off to a good start. European equity markets are a sea of green on Tuesday, and French markets are bouncing back. For now, the markets are ignoring the geopolitical risks bubbling around the world. The French government is poised to collapse at some point this week, and China has decided to ban the export to the US of some items that can be used for military purposes, including gallium, geranium and other superhard materials. It will also use implement a stricter screening process for graphite exports to the US, which is a crucial input to produce lithium batteries. It will be interesting to see how Elon Musk reacts to this, and it suggests that the rest of the world will meet President Trump’s war on global trade blow for blow. French stocks are rallying despite the prospect of Michel Barnier’s government falling this week. Yesterday, leftwing and far-right parties lodged motions of no confidence after Barnier decided to push through a belt-tightening budget without a vote. Mujtaba Rahman. managing director of Eurasia Group, reckons Barnier has only a 20% chance of surviving the censure vote on Wednesday afternoon. If his government falls, all Barnier’s unfinished legislation—including the rest of the 2025 budget plan—falls too. Rahman says: France now faces its second period of political turmoil in less than five months at a time of gathering international crisis; President Emmanuel Macron will have to appoint a new Prime Minister rapidly—just possibly Barnier again but more likely a stopgap figure—in order to pass emergency tax legislation to keep the French government functioning beyond 1 January. Tiz the season for annual forecasts, and investment bank Saxo has got into the Christmas spirit by releasing its latest Outrageous Predictions, for 2025. These are events which are highly unlikely, but not impossible, and which would send shockwaves across financial markets if they did occur. The kind of things to keep at the back of the mind, just in case.

Protesters are out in full force ahead of an appearance by Barclays CEO CS Venkatakrishnan at the FT Banking Summit in London this morning. Dozens of activists are gathered outside of the Convene Centre near St Pauls - next to the London Stock Exchange - where Venkatakrishan is due to be interviewed as part of the FT Banking Summit at 10:15am. They’re protesting what they claim is the UK bank’s support for arms companies supplying Israel in its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Barclays has long been a target for both climate and anti-war campaigners, some of whom have vandalised Barclays branches across the UK in protest. Venkatakrishnan has continued to condemn their behaviour, and said this summer that he believed public opinion was more balanced that the protesters would lead some to believe. NatWest CEO Paul Thwaite says the bank is on a “fast trajectory to private ownership”, with the government likely to fully exit its stake within the first half of 2025. Kicking the FT Banking Summit at the Convene Centre near London’s St Paul’s Cathedral this morning, Thwaite said this will be “symbolic” for both NatWest staff and the entire banking sector, allowing the industry to close another chapter of the fallout from the 2008 banking crash. The Treasury spent nearly £46bn to bailout NatWest - back when it was known as Royal Bank of Scotland - at the height of the financial crisis. The resulting nationalisation left taxpayers owning around 84% of the lender. But a rapid sell-off over the past year has cut the remaining public stake in Natwest from 38% in December 2023 to just under 11% today. Thwaite says: “Absent some big kind of dislocation and economic events, you know, we’ll be back to private ownership next year, maybe as early the first half of the year, and that will be a great moment” And reaching that point will mean the bank can draw a line under a tumultuous chapter in the bank’s near-300 year history, Thwaite explained: “It means we can talk about the future of the bank and the potential of the bank, rather than having to talk about its past. So yeah, all, as you say, All things being well, but I think we’re on a very fast trajectory to private ownership, and I’m very proud of that” Jaguar’s new concept car has been given the thumbs up, by the Daily Telegraph. And, er, the thumbs down too. Despite not usually being a fan of change, El Tel is hailing the new electric car as “a design triumph” in an early review this morning. Their motoring correspondent, Andrew English, writes: Certainly Jaguar has traditionally been at its best when it’s done something different, but this strategy is also fantastically risky – even if it is perhaps the only path left open. For all the misleading and occasionally barbed PR and social media, it’s all window dressing until the new car is in the showrooms and they’re trying to sell it. Then the truth will out. One can’t help wishing them luck and hoping that McGovern is right when he says in uncharacteristically modest tone: “We’re taking Jaguar back to a time when it was truly loved, because it was unique.” The bodywork of the concept car, English reports, is “largely unadorned”, but with details including “almost industrial slatted ventilator panels at front and rear”, and the raw brass hinge-out panels at the base of the front wings containing the rear-view cameras. The two-seat interior is “ voluptuous” with a suitcase rack behind. English got a peek at Jaguar’s concept car yesterday at Gaydon, the company’s headquarters (The Guardian declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), so couldn’t go). He reports that the new car has a long, untreated brass interior door handle, which will react with the sweat on hands to produce “a distinctive odour”. That, apparently, is a good thing. Mary Crisp, chief of materiality design, explains: “It’s about how car materials age. They don’t have to stay the same, they can grow and change during the life of the vehicle.” But…. down the corridor at the Telegraph, Matthew Lynn reckons the ‘Barbie’ relaunch is a disaster for an iconic brand, adding: And instead of breaking new ground, and revolutionising the way its machines are designed as promised, it looks, well, sort of like a lot of the other upmarket cars on the market. It could be the new Audi, Tesla, or Lexus. Britain’s economic inactivity problem isn’t quite as bad as feared, the country’s statistics body has revealed. The Office for National Statistics has updated its assessment of the labour force, based on new population estimates – a calculation that has increased the number of 16 to 64 year olds in the UK by 484,000. This has lifted the estimated number of people in work by 402,000 in the April-June quarter, while the number unemploywed has been raised by 30,000. An extra 60,000 people were economically inactive – neither in work nor looking for a job – the ONS estimates. These changes mean the the employment rate is revised up 0.1 percentage points to 74.6% in April to June 2024, while the unemployment rate is largely unchanged at 4.2% and the economic inactivity rate is down 0.1 percentage points to 22.1%. These changes, though, won’t fix the wider peoblems with the ONS’s labour force statistics, which have been hampered by low response rates. It says today it has reweighted data going back to 2019, and will release the results on 17 December with its next jobs report. Speaking in Miami last night, Jaguar’s creative chief Professor Gerry McGovern has said that the new brand was “influenced by the desire to recapture the essence of Jaguar’s original creative conviction”. PA Media reports: “Some may love it now, some may love it later and some may never love it. That’s what fearless creativity does,” he said, citing David Bowie, Vivienne Westwood and architect Richard Rogers as some of his creative heroes “They were British trailblazers who challenged convention and had no desire to copy the norm. “Controversy has always surrounded British creativity when it’s been at its best.” Among the design work on the new Jag is a laser-etching of the Jaguar logo in brass ingots on each side of the car. You get into the vehicle through two “butterfly” doors; inside are three hand-finished brass lines which run the length of the interior. One, down the middle, splits a pair of floating instrument panels. The “floating” front seats are finished in a wool blend which is also used on the flooring and other areas. Here are more photos of the Type 00 concept car from Miami overnight: Adrian Mardell, JLR’s chief executive officer, is promising “spectacular” results from Jaguar’s new shift, saying: The magic of Jaguar is close to my heart – an original British luxury brand unmatched in its heritage, artistry and emotional magnetism. That’s the Jaguar we are recapturing and we will create the same sense of awe that surrounded iconic models like the E‑type. Our journey is already underway, guided by our original ethos to Copy Nothing – and the results will be spectacular.” The scale of the backlash last month following Jaguar’s 30-second teaser trailer in which a group of brightly dressed models, but no actual cars, was rather over the top. The adverts came with a “Copy nothing” tagline, channelling Jaguar founder William Lyons, while signalling a decisive break with the company’s past as an old school luxury brand. If it was designed to attract attention, it certainly succeeded; critics included Elon Musk and Nigel Farage. But today, Jaguar is keen to focus on its plan to be “bold and disruptive” with its new electric car and redesign, announced last night in Miami. Managing director Rawdon Glover told Sky News: “We’ve certainly gathered an awful lot of attention over the last few weeks, but now I think its really important to talk about the vehicle.” As Glover points out, few car launches get quite as much attention, adding that the industry is at a crucial point: We need to make sure that Jaguar is relevant, is desirable, is future proof for the next 90 years of its history. “At the moment, the industry is going through huge disruption: technology changes, as we all figure out actually what an electrified world means for our brand. “At Jaguar, we’ve looked at that and we think we have to make a really bold step forward. But actually, the step we’re going to take is completely in keeping in ethos with the brand.” Glover was also pressed about the backlash against that advert, and insisted: “We absolutely don’t want to alienate any of our loyal fans. “Quite the opposite - we want to take as many of our current fans with us on that journey... We need to also appeal to a new audience. That’s what we need to do.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. “There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,” as Oscar Wilde reminded us. And carmaker Jaguar has avoided the latter fate, in the build-up to the unveiling of its vision for its new electric car. After an advertising campaign that led to accusations Jaguar was brusquely ditching its old followers, it now unveiled its Type 00 electric model at Miami Art Week in Florida. Described as as “design vision concept,” Jaguar says the model is a “concept with bold forms and exuberant proportions to inspire future Jaguars”. Shown in two colours, Miami Pink and London Blue, it has a long bonnet, 23‑inch alloy wheels, and a glassless rear tailgate. That means you can’t look out through the back window, and must use rear-view cameras installed near the front wheel instead. But this is just the first step. Jaguar’s first production car under this new strategy will be an electric four‑door GT, which will be unveiled late next year. This new model will target a range of up to 770km/478 miles. under the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure testing system, while rapid charging will add 200 miles of charge in 15 minutes. Jaguar’s chief creative officer, professor Gerry McGovern OBE, says: Type 00 is a pure expression of Jaguar’s new creative philosophy. It has an unmistakable presence. This is the result of brave, unconstrained creative thinking, and unwavering determination. It is our first physical manifestation and the foundation stone for a new family of Jaguars that will look unlike anything you’ve ever seen. A vision which strives for the highest level of artistic endeavour.

                    "bodyText": "Google’s central London office cost as much as a tech unicorn and the company’s UK boss, Debbie Weinstein, says it pulses with a similar spirit. “It feels like a startup energy,” she says. However, we are meeting on a morning when Google has been threatened with a reckoning reserved for members of the corporate establishment, not tech ingenues: a breakup. Hours earlier, the US Department of Justice had asked a federal judge to order the sale of Google’s Chrome browser, along with a host of other actions including making its search index – a database of all the webpages it has crawled – available to competitors. It follows a ruling by the same judge in August that the $2tn company has built an illegal monopoly in the search market. “We have, vigorously, been clear about the fact that we disagree with the judge’s findings,” says the 51-year-old American, adding that at least Judge Amit Mehta’s verdict found that Google operates the “best” search engine. According to Mehta, that success has come at an unacceptable cost to competition. The process will drag on, says Weinstein – “I think this is going to take many years to resolve” – so, in the meantime, it’s back to focusing on the UK and artificial intelligence. “While I am working in the UK, my focus here is on making sure we’re continuing to build products that enable everyone in the UK to take advantage of the major shift that’s happening towards AI,” she says. “And try not to get overly distracted by the fact that [the case] is going on behind the scenes.” This is where the startup reference comes in, as Weinstein acknowledges Google is far from its origins in a California garage – “obviously, we’re a very large company at this point, not remotely a startup” – but that AI has given it a new phase of development that harks back to founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page’s early days. “That energy that you have from creating something new … feels like we are very much living in that moment right now at Google,” she says. The Google-owned Central Saint Giles office we are speaking in cost the company $1bn – the same valuation assigned to so-called tech unicorns – which shows how far the business has come since that temporary home in 1998. Google is also building another vast office nearby. Work started on its new £1bn UK headquarters in King’s Cross in 2017, and it stretches to 330m, making it longer than the 310m Shard skyscraper is tall. King’s Cross is also the location for Google’s AI unit, Google DeepMind, run by Sir Demis Hassabis. Weinstein has direct experience of starting a business before she became managing director of Google in the UK and Ireland. She was an executive at US media group Viacom and Unilever before joining Google, but sandwiched between those roles she also founded a children’s food company in 2006, which she closed after a year and a half. “I founded and shut down a business, so it was not successful,” she says, adding that she found being an entrepreneur “actually really lonely; I miss being part of a team.” She adds: “I think I am really effective in large organisations. I’m effective at galvanising teams, focusing them on what matters.” For creative professionals and publishers grappling with the emergence of generative AI – products such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which can create realistic voice, text and image from simple prompts – Google is one of several supremely well-resourced multinational tech groups that are challenging their livelihoods with AI tools. Creatives’ concerns centre on copyrighted material, such as novels, song lyrics, scripts and news articles, that have been used, without compensation, to “train” AI models to produce their outputs. In an interview with the Guardian in September, Weinstein urged the UK to relax restrictions on a practice known as text and data mining (TDM), where copying of copyrighted work is allowed for non-commercial purposes such as academic research. Google wants TDM to be allowed for commercial use – such as training new AI models. Weinstein’s comments – “the unresolved copyright issue is a block to development,” she said at the time – drew pushback from Justine Roberts, chief executive of the Mumsnet website, who wrote that her “jaw hit the floor” when she read Weinstein’s pitch for a relaxation in copyright law. A month later, tens of thousands of creative professionals, including Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus and the actor Julianne Moore, signed a statement warning that unlicensed use of their work in AI models was a “major, unjust threat” to artists’ livelihoods. Weinstein is talking while surrounded by the work of copyright holders, in the library of the Central Saint Giles office, and points out that Google already gives creatives and publishers the option to block their content from being used in model training. “Absolutely we think there needs to be an opt-out and we do enable an opt-out today,” she says, although the organiser of the AI letter has said opt-out schemes do not offer robust enough protection. Weinstein adds that Google would like to see an EU-style regime where TDM is allowed for commercial reasons so long as there is an opt-out. She says: “We’re looking for clarification at the level of the EU that enables us to do model training here for commercial purposes, not just research purposes.” Weinstein views embedding AI in the UK workforce as “the No 1 thing I’m working on” and last month Google launched a programme to encourage small and medium-sized businesses to adopt AI tools. Weinstein’s assertion reflects where tech firms are in the AI investment boom: astonishing breakthroughs have been made, but companies and governments now need to deploy these AI tools so the likes of Google, OpenAI and Microsoft can generate a return on their substantial capital investments. This has led to forecasts that AI will ultimately cause displacement of vast amounts of jobs. Weinstein’s argument, echoed by the likes of Microsoft, is that AI models will take over mundane day-to-day tasks, freeing up more productive work. The biggest opportunity, she says, is for employees “to find ways to apply these tools to their daily work and actually take out some of these administrative tasks that are not fun for most people.” The main job threat, she adds, is competing with people who are ahead of you in adopting the technology. “It’s not about you getting replaced by AI. It’s about you getting replaced by somebody who’s using AI better than you are,” she says. “It’s more about you being outcompeted in the marketplace.” CV Age 51 Family Married, one daughter.

                    "bodyText": "This morning, I walked past an advert for something described as the anal gland revolution. I didn’t know anal glands had been calling for a revolution and, futhermore, what’s going to happen once they start buying munitions? In recent years, the word “revolution” has become as overused, meaningless and commodified as other natty terms such as “journey”, “community” and “identity”. I did a quick search of the word “revolution” in my inbox to see what else is out there and, among others, I found references to The Self Love Revolution (a midlife podcast), a break-up revolution (changing energy provider), a youth-led revolution (which turned out to be about floristry) and a revolution in chicken (essentially, salt). Perhaps it’s because I’m teaching year 9 pupils Animal Farm at the moment, but this wholesale gobbling up of the word “revolution” by the advertising and PR industries makes me wonder if it might be time to come up with a whole new vocabulary for the overthrow of a government. Reincarlution? Expulsiocracy? Ploughism? I don’t know – branding isn’t really my thing. Away from the moral wasteland of consumer promotion, the word “revolution” is also getting a pretty good run-around in political, economic and social commentary. From the sexual revolution of the 1960s to the social media revolution of the early 21st century, with a green revolution, education revolution and AI revolution along the way. All of which surely means we need something to differentiate between the systematic removal and replacement of social and political order from, well, a new website or type of mascara (or, should I say, the “eyelash revolution”). If you’re still wondering when the anal gland revolution is going to arrive and how best to reinforce your windows in preparation, let me clarify: the anal gland revolution is – and believe me, I’m as disappointed as you are – the tagline for a new dog chew. One that will, apparently, stop your dog skidding its bum along the carpet. Vive la glande, I guess. • Nell Frizzellis the author of Holding the Baby: Milk, Sweat and Tears from the Frontline of Motherhood"

                    "bodyText": "AI means too many (different) things to too many people. We need better ways of talking – and thinking – about it. Cue, Drew Breunig, a gifted geek and cultural anthropologist, who has come up with a neat categorisation of the technology into three use cases: gods, interns and cogs. “Gods”, in this sense, would be “super-intelligent, artificial entities that do things autonomously”. In other words, the AGI (artificial general intelligence) that OpenAI’s Sam Altman and his crowd are trying to build (at unconscionable expense), while at the same time warning that it could be an existential threat to humanity. AI gods are, Breunig says, the “human replacement use cases”. They require gigantic models and stupendous amounts of “compute”, water and electricity (not to mention the associated CO2 emissions). “Interns” are “supervised co-pilots that collaborate with experts, focusing on grunt work”. In other words, things such as ChatGPT, Claude, Llama and similar large language models (LLMs). Their defining quality is that they are meant to be used and supervised by experts. They have a high tolerance for errors because the experts they are assisting are checking their output, preventing embarrassing mistakes from going further. They do the boring work: remembering documentation and navigating references, filling in the details after the broad strokes are defined, assisting with idea generation by acting as a dynamic sounding board and much more. Finally, “cogs” are lowly machines that are optimised to perform a single task extremely well, usually as part of a pipeline or interface. Interns are mostly what we have now; they represent AI as a technology that augments human capabilities and are already in widespread use in many industries and occupations. In that sense, they are the first generation of quasi-intelligent machines with which humans have had close cognitive interactions in work settings, and we’re beginning to learn interesting things about how well those human-machine partnerships work. One area in which there are extravagant hopes for AI is healthcare. And with good reason. In 2018, for example, a collaboration between AI researchers at DeepMind and Moorfields eye hospital in London significantly speeded up the analysis of retinal scans to detect the symptoms of patients who needed urgent treatment. But in a way, though technically difficult, that was a no-brainer: machines can “read” scans incredibly quickly and pick out ones that need specialist diagnosis and treatment. But what about the diagnostic process itself, though? Cue an intriguing US study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which reported a randomised clinical trial on whether ChatGPT could improve the diagnostic capabilities of 50 practising physicians. The ho-hum conclusion was that “the availability of an LLM to physicians as a diagnostic aid did not significantly improve clinical reasoning compared with conventional resources”. But there was a surprising kicker: ChatGPT on its own demonstrated higher performance than both physician groups (those with and without access to the machine). Or, as the New York Times summarised it, “doctors who were given ChatGPT-4 along with conventional resources did only slightly better than doctors who did not have access to the bot. And, to the researchers’ surprise, ChatGPT alone outperformed the doctors.” More interesting, though, were two other revelations: the experiment demonstrated doctors’ sometimes unwavering belief in a diagnosis they had made, even when ChatGPT suggested a better one; and it also suggested that at least some of the physicians didn’t really know how best to exploit the tool’s capabilities. Which in turn revealed what AI advocates such as Ethan Mollick have been saying for aeons: that effective “prompt engineering” – knowing what to ask an LLM to get the most out of it – is a subtle and poorly understood art. Equally interesting is the effect that collaborating with an AI has on the humans involved in the partnership. Over at MIT, a researcher ran an experiment to see how well material scientists could do their job if they could use AI in their research. The answer was that AI assistance really seems to work, as measured by the discovery of 44% more materials and a 39% increase in patent filings. This was accomplished by the AI doing more than half of the “idea generation” tasks, leaving the researchers to the business of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. So the AI did most of the “thinking”, while they were relegated to the more mundane chore of evaluating the practical feasibility of the ideas. And the result: the researchers experienced a sharp reduction in job satisfaction! Interesting, n’est-ce pas? These researchers are high-flyers, not low-status operatives. But suddenly, collaborating with a smart machine made them feel like… well, cogs. And the moral? Be careful what you wish for.

                    "bodyText": "JD Vance is being weird again Melania Trump has made it clear that her second stint at being first lady will be conducted entirely on her own terms. It’s been reported that she’s unlikely to move back to the White House and will spend a lot of the next four years flitting between New York and Florida. Maybe she’ll write another coffee table book. Maybe she’ll develop another caviar-infused skincare line. Who knows. But whatever she does, it’ll be in the service of her own interest, rather than the country’s. With Melania not particularly interested in being by Donald’s side, there’s a void to be filled. And it looks like JD Vance and Elon Musk are furiously competing to win the incoming president’s affections. Musk has basically been camping out at Mar-a-Lago since the election, and has earned “uncle status” according to Trump’s granddaughter Kai. The tech billionaire also had a seat at the Trump family table for Thanksgiving dinner, where he bopped to YMCA and presumably had a little giggle over a bizarre AI-generated video Trump tweeted which showed Donald popping out of a turkey Joe Biden was about to carve and gyrating. It’s not clear if Musk, who spent the rest of the day tweeting self-aggrandizing videos of himself, had any quality time with his children over the holiday but that seems to be his MO: urging people to have multiple kids while ignoring his own. JD Vance may be the next vice-president but from the looks of it, Musk very much seems to be Trump’s number two. Vance looks keen to change that, however, and celebrated Thanksgiving with a weird tweet of his own. The vice-president-elect posted an edited image of Norman Rockwell’s 1943 Thanksgiving painting Freedom from Want with Trump’s face Photoshopped on the patriarch and Vance Photoshopped over the wife. (To be clear: it’s not explicitly stated who the matriarch figure is in the painting but, while Rockwell’s cook is the model, the woman is often interpreted as being the wife of the man she’s standing next to.) In the original painting, the matriarch is holding up a turkey. In Vance’s version he – clad in an apron and blue dress – is holding up a very red map of America. Once upon a time Vance compared Trump to Hitler; now he’s eagerly doctoring pictures so he can depict himself as Trump’s trad wife. Why would Vance embarrass himself like this? Former Kamala Harris adviser Mike Nellis reckons “Vance is worried about Elon having more influence than him, so he thought posting this weird ass meme would win him favor again.” I’m not sure anyone should listen to a Democratic strategist about anything ever again but this interpretation does seem about right. While I couldn’t tell you exactly what went through Vance’s head when he posted an image of himself as an aproned matriarch, I can very confidently say that we have (at the very least) four more years of these sorts of posts. Forget the banality of evil, the Trump administration represents the inanity of evil: we’re going to see the passing of inhumane policies, the rollback of reproductive rights, and the gutting of public services alongside idiotic memes designed to “own the libs”. The online trolls have crawled out from below the bridge and now advise the president; the shitposters are in charge now. I guess it’s totally fine to threaten Muslim congresswomen in the US now Speaking of trolls, Trump-endorsed congressional candidate and Florida state senator Randy Fine tweeted a casual death threat to Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar – the only Muslim women in Congress – this week. “The Hebrew Hammer is coming,” Fine tweeted. “[Rashida Tlaib] and [Ilhan Omar] might consider leaving before I get there. #BombsAway.” Can you imagine if Tlaib or Omar had delivered a similar message to Fine? It would be front-page news and Biden would have made an outraged statement. This was barely covered. Fine is the same guy, by the way, who cheered the murder of 26-year-old American citizen Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, an activist reportedly killed by the Israeli forces while peacefully protesting illegal settlements in the West Bank. Blue Origin deletes video of female astronaut after sexist comments Astronaut and MIT-trained engineer Emily Calandrelli became the 100th woman in space when she joined six space tourists in a Blue Origin launch. An Instagram video of her excited reaction to being in space was inundated with misogynistic comments, which led to Blue Origin taking it down. Being a woman in the public eye is a real barrel of laughs! A fifth woman has died as a likely result of abortion bans According to ProPublica, Porsha Ngumezi, a 35-year-old Texas woman, is the fifth woman who is known to have died because their medical care was delayed after miscarriages or because they couldn’t undergo legal abortions. Fox News’ Jesse Watters: ‘Trump’s going to treat Denver like a woman. He’s going to protect the city whether they like it or not’ Poor Denver. Brazilian congressional committee votes for bill to ban abortion in all cases That includes in cases of fetal deformation, rape or when the mother’s health is in danger. The proposed bill has to go to a special committee before it can advance further but the fact it has got this far is alarming.

Meanwhile, the US government and its allies continue to undermine the ICC and international law. Israel’s finance minister proposes ‘thinning out’ Gaza’s population “It is possible to create a situation where Gaza’s population will be reduced to half its current size in two years,” the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Monday. (While these remarks were covered by the Israeli press, they strangely didn’t seem to be deemed newsworthy by a lot of the US press.) Israeli settlers are already preparing to occupy the strip and build new houses next to mass graves.

                    "bodyText": "We’re finally approaching the business end of Black Friday, and stores have stumped up some delectable discounts on products we’ve recommended in the Filter. If you followed our advice in our guide to not getting ripped off in the sales, you may have waited until now to splurge on Black Friday deals, and might even be clutching a strict shopping list. Now’s your time to dive in. The big day itself may be on 29 November, but the discounting continues through to Cyber Monday (2 December). Keep an eye on this page throughout the sale, because we’ll update it with any genuine Black Friday bargains on our favourite products of the year, from Ninja air fryers and GHD hair tools to Google Pixels and video doorbells. *** How we selected these Black Friday deals (and excluded others) We’ve looked at more than 300 different products, ranging from £2 fabric plasters to the £1,700 Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, at the Filter. Many are discounted already, but only a select few deals are genuine enough for us to endorse here. A “genuine” Black Friday deal is a discount that undercuts the item’s long-term average price by a notable amount, rather than undoing a cheeky October price hike. Ideally, it will be the lowest price of the year. We use various tools to find this out, including the brilliant browser extension the Camelizer, a free and non-affiliated tool that reveals the price history of any Amazon item. Our recommendations here have the best discounts of all the products we checked (and we checked enough to make Santa sweat). Some categories, such as heated clothes airers and women’s coats, haven’t seen much Black Friday action yet, possibly because they’re good winter sellers anyway, whereas some of the deals below got off the starting blocks days ago. *** The best home deals *** *** The best robot vacuum cleaner Eufy X10 Pro Omni, £579 (was £799.99) very.co.uk amazon.co.uk Eufy’s self-emptying, self-cleaning robot cleaner uses camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors and suck, scrub and dry with outstanding results. Our writer Stuart Andrews named it “best overall” in best robot vacuum cleaners, even at £799. Neither Amazon nor Very dropped the price until the end of Black Friday week, so this is a genuinely good and limited deal. *** Half price Roomba iRobot Roomba Combo J9+, £599 (was £1,249) irobot.co.uk Roomba is the original robot vacuum and remains one of the best – but its full price is hair-raising. The Combo J9+’s quiet and efficient operation made it our tester’s favourite “fuss-free” cleaner, but he noted “it’s expensive if you miss it while it’s on sale”. So here’s your chance. Since its launch in June, the J9+ has cost between £1,249 and £1,311 on Amazon, and we don’t expect this less-than-half-price deal to last long. *** Retro air fryer Wonder Oven, £150 (was £195) fromourplace.co.uk You think you know what an air fryer looks like, right? Well check out this dreamboat, fresh from our essential gifts for food lovers. It doubles as a countertop steam oven and will look so glorious in your kitchen that you probably won’t want to give it away. It’s full price at Amazon, but discounted by almost a quarter at Our Place. ****** Titanium Always Pan Our Place Titanium Always Pan Pro, £135 (was £175) fromourplace.co.uk amazon.co.uk Harrods’ head pastry chef Phil Khoury has only one large pan, he told us for best pans chosen by chefs, and it’s this “virtually indestructible” Always Pan from premium cookware brand Our Place. Titanium is three times harder than stainless steel and fabulously shiny, and we love the classic silhouette of this pan. With £40 off in a rare discount, this is a fine buy for serious cooks. *** Espresso machine Sage Bambino Plus, £300 (was £370) argos.co.uk £347.99 amazon.co.uk This petite version of a professional espresso machine will be the best-looking thing in your kitchen, hands down. Our best coffee machines writer named it “best manual machine for beginners” and called it “a dream” to use, although its full price is pretty high. Amazon’s average price for the Sage is £368 and hasn’t dropped below £300 since 2020, so Argos’s Black Friday deal is a clear winner. *** Electric toothbrush Oral-B Pro 3 toothbrush, £35 (was £40) argos.co.uk amazon.co.uk In our guide to everyday items that can change your life, our money and consumer editor Hilary Osborne credits her electric toothbrush with revolutionising her dental routine and making her dentist nicer to her. The Oral-B Pro 3 cost as much as £90 on Amazon in 2022 but you can normally buy it for around £40. Today’s drop to £35 matches its lowest ever price. *** Handheld steamer Philips 3000 Series handheld steamer, £27 (was £37.99) johnlewis.com £28 argos.co.uk Another one from our university essential guide, this steamer is useful for pretty much anyone who wears clothes. It smoothes out fabric without the need for ironing and freshens up your clothes if you haven’t the time or the inclination to give them a full wash. *** Food processor Magimix 3200XL food processor, £241.66 (was £289.99) nisbets.co.uk £249 amazon.co.uk When we asked chefs to choose their favourite food processors, mixers and blenders, Feast columnist and Dinner author Meera Sodha told us she’d only ever bought this one. “It gets the job done (the job being slicing and chopping), and it has never let me down.” Not a huge price drop, but well below its average Amazon price. *** Stand mixer Lakeland digital stand mixer, £199.99 (was £249.99) lakeland.co.uk amazon.co.uk The best stand mixers are rarely cheap, so we’re happy to see this sturdy but good-looking and lightweight machine dipping to below £200 for Black Friday. Our writer Dale Berning Sawa already deemed it “best value stand mixer” at full price, and with £50 off it’s a buy well worth recommending – just in time to start making that Christmas pud. *** *** Designer wallpaper Connor wallpaper by Harlequin, £55.30 per roll (was £79) janeclayton.co.uk Fashion designer-turned-ceramicist Henry Holland plundered the archive of British textile house Harlequin to create this offbeat but achingly chic wallpaper, one of our favourite homeware collabs for autumn. A little more affordable now, especially with the price seeming to drop incrementally as Black Friday week continues. *** Luxury linen bedding Secret Linen double duvet cover, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, £265.60 (was £330) secretlinenstore.com Our guide to the fair price for 14 everyday items recommends spending £100-£200 for a double duvet set, and this one exceeds that even with a 20% discount for Black Friday. But Secret Linen’s high quality bedding feels amazing against your skin and will last you many years, so our writer Laurie Davidson was happy to include it as a “splurge” – now a little more affordable than it was. *** The essential air fryer Ninja AF100UK, £68.89 (was £79) johnlewis.com amazon.co.uk The experts who helped us compile our university essentials guide in September – that is, students themselves – told us an air fryer is a gamechanger for today’s house-sharers because it makes light, healthy and cheap work of preparing dinner. The supremely efficient Ninja cost as much as £149 last February, so at just under £70, it’s a brilliant buy for the undergrad in your life. *** Double pram Bumprider Connect double stroller, £549.90 (was £779.80) bumprider.com A twin buggy isn’t just for twins – it’s an essential for any parent with two young kids. Parents who told us about the baby gear they wouldn’t go without loved this stroller for its modular design, which connects two individual prams with secure magnets so you can split the load when needed. This is one of the best deals we’ve seen this week, with Bumprider wiping nearly £230 off the price. *** Home strength training kit BlazePod starter kit, £262 (was £349) blazepod.eu The BlazePod system – whose exercise lights and tracking app turn your living room floor into a strength-building gym – popped up in our best at-home exercise kit guide, where personal trainer Ty Paul said he uses them to improve clients’ reaction times, decision making, agility and core stability. We’ve seen similar pods on Amazon with no Black Friday discount, so this £87-off deal is worth snapping up. *** Adjustable dumbbell BodyMax Selectabell, £170.10 (was £189) fitshop.co.uk This innovative dumbbell set was chosen for best at-home exercise kit by Dom Thorpe, personal trainer for people with disabilities and chronic conditions. You use the little dial to select the weight you want, from 2.5kg to 25kg, and the rest stay neatly in place. Just under £19 off is a welcome discount, if not a hefty one. *** *** Premium stand mixer Kenwood Titanium Chef Baker, £299.99 (was £399) amazon.co.uk Home bakers who love hi-tech appliances and bake in large quantities would love Kenwood’s premium stand mixer, according to our writer Dale Berning Sawa in her roundup of the best stand mixers. But with a usual price tag of between £399 and £469, it’s not cheap. This sub-£300 price is now the best you’ll find online and is about 25% off the average price. *** Food Thermos Thermos food flask, £14.37 (was £23) amazon.co.uk £18.40 johnlewis.com Stop forking out for lunch takeouts and treat yourself or your kids to hot food every lunchtime with this fantastic Thermos, which keeps last night’s leftovers steaming hot throughout the next day. It was the Filter editor Hannah Booth’s choice for everyday products that save you money and make life easier, and it’s a design classic to boot. At less than £15, it’s now almost a tenner off, and cheaper than many lunches. *** Luxurious heated throw Dreamland Hurry Home heated throw, £74.99 (was £94.99) johnlewis.com amazon.co.uk The recent frosty snap made us wish we’d invested in heated throws a little sooner because they keep you warm and are cheaper to run than central heating. Still, better late than never, and here’s a great deal: Dreamland’s magnificent heated throw, which featured in everyday products that save you money and make life easier, is now £20 off. It has been discounted before, but its average price is £89 – so this deal is worth snapping up before the temperature plunges again. *** Heated airer Dry:Soon 3-tier heated clothes airer, £129.99 (was £199.99) lakeland.co.uk amazon.co.uk Most of our best heated airers remain stubbornly full-priced this week, but the Dry:Soon 3-tier model without a cover – which also featured in our favourite everyday products that save you money – has seen £15 knocked off its usual price at Lakeland and Amazon. *** Smart baby monitor Owlet Dream Sock, £199 (was £294.99) owletbabycare.co.uk amazon.co.uk The Dream Sock may look and sound gimmicky, but it was hailed as a must-have by parents in our guide to the baby gear parents wouldn’t go without. The medically certified sock wraps comfortably around your baby’s foot and gives you real-time data on their oxygen levels and pulse. It’s not cheap, but at £199 it’s now as affordable as it’s ever been. *** Subscription-free video doorbell Eufy video doorbell, £94.99 (was £155.17) amazon.co.uk £114 johnlewis.com Many video doorbells require a paid subscription, but this Eufy model doesn’t, instead storing videos on the device itself. It’s one of the more expensive video doorbells you can buy, admits tech journalist Andy Shaw in our guide to the best video doorbells, but it packs in extra features such as dual cameras (one for the face, one for the parcels on your doorstep). This is its lowest ever price. *** Battery-operated video doorbell Aqara video doorbell G4, £83.99 (was £119.99) amazon.co.uk Here’s another multitalented model from our roundup of the best video doorbells, this time with a handy microSD slot for videos and a battery compartment that takes six AAs. Unlike rechargeable doorbells, this one never has to be charged – just pop in new batteries and it’s good to go. It’s also available from the Apple Store, but at the time of writing, it’s still £119 there. This is the lowest price on Amazon in two years. *** Sad lamp Beurer portable daylight therapy lamp, £36.84 (was £54.99) hollandandbarrett.com £40 argos.co.uk A daylight lamp can be a winter gamechanger for anyone struggling with mood and lethargy on these dark days – and it can help you sleep, too, by boosting your daytime energy levels. One of our best sleep aids, this 10,000-lux Sad (seasonal affective disorder) lamp is now a third off in the Holland &amp; Barrett sale. *** Capsule coffee machine Nespresso Vertuo Plus by Magimix, £89 (was £199) fenwick.co.uk £99 amazon.co.uk Coffee machines are a great category for Black Friday discounts, and if you nip over to our list of the best coffee machines, you’ll see we’ve updated prices to reflect current offers. The standout offer is Fenwick’s less-than-half-price deal on the Vertuo Plus, praised for its quiet operation and versatility by our reviewer Sasha Muller, who named it his favourite Nespresso machine. *** Sparkling water maker Philips GoZero Sparkling Water Maker, £56.99 (was £99.99) amazon.co.uk Stop buying pricey Perrier or plastic bottles of soda water and use this brilliant machine to make it yourself. No longer available from Philips, the GoZero is now at its lowest Amazon price since last December. Our writer Kate Lloyd called it a gamechanger and voted to include it in everyday products that save you time and money. *** Sewing machine Janome 7025 sewing machine, £237.15 (was £279) johnlewis.com Another everyday product that saves you time and money, this was suggested by the Guardian’s Ruth Lewy. Ruth’s Janome sewing machine has kept her in homemade curtains, kids’ outfits and cushion covers for many years. This model is still fairly pricey after John Lewis’s discount, but it will last decades and could slash your spending on clothes. *** Kids’ cosy blanket John Lewis kids’ faux fur blanket, £20.40 (was £24) johnlewis.com “Very pretty and comforting,” said our expert, Ellie, 13, when reviewing this snuggly throw for our roundup of the best Christmas gifts. Already great value at £24 in any one of four colours, the faux fur 120 x 150cm blanket is now 15% off. *** Toddlers’ story Toniebox Toniebox, £62.98 (was £79.95) amazon.co.uk £63.96 tonies.com This starter set with a Toniebox and one Tonie bedtime story is a lovely Christmas gift for toddlers, who can listen to Tonies to wind down before bed. The Tonies store has reduced Tonieboxes, bundles and accessories by 20% for Black Friday. The starter set is down to its lowest price on Amazon since 2022. *** Hand weights Proiron neoprene dumbbell set, £36.54 (was £49.99) amazon.co.uk £64.99 proiron.com “Weight training helps prevent osteoporosis and makes us feel stronger so we can do our daily activities,” says former Olympian Michelle Griffith-Robinson in our best home exercise kit roundup. This neoprene dumbbell set comprises two each of 1kg, 2kg and 3kg weights that don’t roll, so you can use them for presses and push-ups as well as lifting. This is its lowest price ever on Amazon. *** The best hair and beauty deals *** Hermès rhubarb cologne Hermès Eau de Rhubarbe 50ml, £59.20 (was £74) sephora.co.uk Rhubarb perfume? But wait, this is a serious Christmas gift recommendation by the Observer Magazine’s beauty editor Funmi Fetto, who calls Hermès’ fruity fragrance “exquisite”. Selfridges hasn’t discounted it and Amazon has only the 100ml bottle (£99.75), so Sephora’s deal is a standout. *** Curling tongs ghd Curve Soft curl tong, £124 (was £159) ghdhair.com £109.99 johnlewis.com The 32mm ghd Curve Soft curl tong is a classic hair tool that – according to the stylists we interviewed about their favourite at-home hair styling tools – creates an effortless, undone look that’s not too big and bouncy. These tongs also have safety features that mean you won’t burn your carpet, or indeed your house down. *** Jumbo waver Beauty Works Jump waver, £45.49 (was £70) beautyworksonline.com If you’re after bouncy beach waves, this triple-barrel wave tong is your answer. Another from our at-home hair styling tools, the Jump waver was hair stylist Liam Curran’s pick: “Whenever I do Shakira’s hair, it’s my go-to for her soft wave,” he said. Now more than a third has been wiped off its price by Beauty Works’ own store. *** Exfoliating body stick The Inkey List glycolic body stick, £11.25 (was £15) theinkeylist.com Glycolic acid is a wonder ingredient that helps to unclog pores, prevent ingrown hairs, soothe rough patches and even clear up body spots. One of our 14 best beauty buys to restore hair, skin and nails, this brilliantly easy stick was already a good price, but it now drops 30% in the Inkey List’s early Black Friday sale. *** Chanel body fragrance Chanel Coco Mademoiselle body mist, £36.80 (was £46) johnlewis.com In her roundup of everything she’s learned as a beauty columnist, our writer and self-confessed scent fiend Anita Bhagwandas shares an excellent tip for saving money on Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle perfume, which costs £122 for 100ml. Get the body mist instead because it’s normally a much better buy than the perfume at £46 for 100ml. And now John Lewis’s Black Friday sale pushes it down to just £36.80, an excellent deal for a premium scent. *** Invisible SPF stick Clarins Invisible Sun Care Stick SPF 50+, £19.20 (was £24) boots.com Clarins Sun Care is reliably terrific across the range, and in our list of 11 best sunscreens for every need, Sali Hughes praised this solid SPF stick for its smooth, invisible application. It also smells great and doesn’t sting your eyes. It’s not fallen to below £21.50 since May 2021, so this deal is a genuinely good chance to stock up on a high-protection invisible block that’s needed on sunny winter days every bit as much as in the summer. *** Hairdryer Dyson Supersonic Nural hairdryer, £329.99 (was £399.99) dyson.co.uk boots.com Over 300 quid is a lot to spend on a hairdryer, even when it’s had 20% shaved off for Black Friday. But the stylists we spoke to for 14 best at-home styling tools had no hesitation in including this model. It smartly measures your scalp temperature to avoid overheating your hair and comes with various attachments to help you recreate a salon finish. *** The best technology deals *** Safer running headphones Shokz OpenRun, £89 (was £129.95) uk.shokz.com amazon.co.uk Music is a bottom-line essential for many of us when we run, but noise-blocking headphones and earbuds can compromise your safety, especially on darker nights and mornings. Runners’ Retreat director Matt Whiting recommends these non-blocking alternatives in our gifts for runners roundup, adding that they’re one of the few headphones approved by England Athletics for racing on roads. A reduction of more than £40 brings the Shokz down to their lowest ever Amazon price. *** OS maps app Ordnance Survey app subscription, £24.49 a year (was £34.99) shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk Perhaps we’re stretching the definition of tech deals here, but you’ll need a mobile device to make use of this great gift for runners. Ordnance Survey’s £10-off deal for a year’s full access was recommended by ultrarunner Sophie Power, who loves that the app “helps you find trails and paths wherever you are”. *** Budget Samsung phone Samsung Galaxy A15, £124.50 (was £199) amazon.co.uk £139.99 argos.co.uk We’ve already seen some good deals on the best smartphones for kids, but if you’re a Samsung family this should be your choice. The Galaxy A15 has Android 14 and 4G support, and will get security updates until January 2029. It dipped to below £100 on Amazon earlier this year so this isn’t an essential deal, but £124.50 is still a good price and well-timed for Christmas. *** Nokia for kids HMD Pulse, £79.99 (was £99.99) hmd.com HMD is the parent company of Nokia, often the brand of choice for feature-limited “dumbphones” that offer long software support and make excellent phones for kids. Released under the HMD name for reasons unclear, the Pulse runs Android 14 and is one of few phones that you can take apart to repair at home if needed – and is now £20 off for Black Friday. *** Apple iPhone iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB, £1,049 (was £1,099) johnlewis.com The iPhone 16 arrived to shake up our best Apple iPhones list just a few weeks ago, which means the still-outstanding iPhone 15 and its assorted variations are being discounted for Black Friday … or so you’d hope. This £50 discount on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is one of very few i-deals to have landed so far. Not the heftiest of savings, but you could put it towards an on-trend phone strap? *** Best value Android Google Pixel 8a, £354.99 (was £499) johnlewis.com amazon.co.uk The best value pick in our roundup of the best Android phones is now even better value, dropping from its regular price of £499 to just £354.99. Our consumer technology editor Samuel Gibbs called it a top-tier phone without the high-end price and was amazed that it comes with seven years of software support from release. It’s now its lowest price ever, and £100 off its average Amazon price. *** Google Pixel 9 Google Pixel 9 256GB, £785 (was £899) amazon.co.uk £799 johnlewis.com The best all-rounder in Google’s series 9 Pixel range deservedly topped our best Android phones list with its balance of price, size, features and camera quality. Already significantly cheaper than comparable iPhones, it also gets a deeper Black Friday cut than Apple’s devices. The 128GB model is around £100 cheaper still. *** iPhone 16 Apple iPhone 16 128GB, £769 (was £799) very.co.uk £779 amazon.co.uk Named “best iPhone for most people” by our consumer technology editor Samuel Gibbs in best Apple iPhones, the new iPhone 16 inevitably isn’t seeing huge discounts this Black Friday – not least because retailers know people will pay top dollar for it, especially ahead of Christmas. Very’s £30 discount is more generous than we’d expected, and outdoes Amazon’s deal by £10. *** Top-of-the-range iPhone 16 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB, £1,169 (was £1,199) very.co.uk £1,179 amazon.co.uk Watching movies on the bright, smooth 6.9in display of the priciest iPhone in Apple’s 16 series lineup “feels more like using a small tablet than a phone” says Samuel Gibbs, naming this high-end beast of a device “best for screen” in our best iPhones roundup. Very wins the Black Friday deal again, albeit not by “very” much. *** Sleep headphones Musicozy headphones, £15.99 (was £20.82) amazon.co.uk Drift off to the sound of music, podcasts or the most soporifically boring radio you can find with this soft headband that contains tiny embedded speakers. One of our best sleep aid recommendations, Musicozy is also great for keeping your ears warm while you run in winter. Now with a fiver off in all colours and patterns. *** The best Kindle Kindle Paperwhite 2024 16GB, £124.99 (was £159.99) argos.co.uk amazon.co.uk The Paperwhite has always been the “easiest Amazon e-reader to recommend” according to our tester Andrew Williams, and its latest model takes top spot in our best e-readers rundown. This “beautiful canvas for novels” boasts a much faster performance in this 2024 iteration, which has cost £159.99 at Argos, Amazon and elsewhere since going on sale. This week’s £30 discount makes it a first-rate gift choice. *** Premium Pixel Google Pixel 9 Pro, £899 (was £999) johnlewis.com Google’s superb flagship is our pick for “best camera alternative” in best Android phones. This outstanding device normally costs a whisper under £1,000 and, despite this new £100 discount, it’s still one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy. But it’s also one of the best, and this price drop may be your best chance to make a saving on it. *** Foldable Pixel Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, £1,449 (was £1,749) google.com amazon.co.uk If you thought the Pixel Pro was pricey, avert your eyes from this absolute beast of a device that doubles as a phone and tablet in one. In best Android phones, we praised its large screen, 256GB storage and nimble performance and if you’re into AI tools, you’ll find them all here. Its usual price tag of £1,749 is hair-raising, and with £300 off it’s merely eyebrow-raising. *** Budget Android for kids Moto G34, £109.99 (was £149.99) argos.co.uk £139.99 amazon.co.uk Mercifully we now head to the other end of the price spectrum with an Android for just over £100. Motorola’s Moto G34 featured in our roundup of the best smartphones for kids, where we liked its big battery, large screen and 5G connectivity. Importantly, it also gets security updates until 2027. The Moto G34 is normally superb value at about £150, so this price drop makes it a brilliant buy as well as a fab Christmas present. *** Anker power banks Anker Nano, £26.98 (was £39.99) amazon.co.uk Anker Powercore 20100, £29.99 (was £44.99) amazon.co.uk Power banks are everyday necessities in the 2020s, so we couldn’t leave them out of our university essentials and autumn hiking roundups. Anker’s models are particularly powerful and reliable, with the 10,000mAh Nano adding a handy display that shows how much charge is left. The Powercore’s ultra-high 20,000mAh capacity lets you use power-hungry maps, GPS and video while you’re up a mountain all day. Both power banks have just fallen to their lowest price ever. *** The best deals on clothing, shoes and accessories *** Women’s running T-shirt Under Armour women’s short sleeve top, from £15.97 (was £32) underarmour.co.uk This lightweight T-shirt was suggested for Christmas gifts for runners by Vicky Camy from social running group Run 2 Drink, who said: “It’s sweat-wicking and I never have any problems with seam rubbing”. Only the bright yellow is £15.97; most other colours are £22.40, still a sizeable discount. Time to stock up. *** Dad cap Late Night Service dad cap, £27.97 (was £39.95) lesdeux.co.uk “Dad caps are the new (and much chicer) novelty socks” says our menswear editor Helen Seamons in 242 best Christmas gifts for 2024, but at just shy of £40 this 100% brushed cotton twill cap is not normally what you’d call a bargain. Now much more affordable in both colours, taupe and black. *** Cult socks J’Adoro Aries socks, £14 (was £22) ariesarise.com Caps may be chic but socks are still the most reliable Christmas gift buy, especially when they look and feel as good as these blue or black sports socks from cult brand Aries. Chosen for 242 best gifts by our senior fashion writer Lauren Cochrane, both colours have had £8 knocked off for Black Friday. *** Classic men’s pyjamas Organic cotton poplin stripe pyjama set, £32 (was £40) johnlewis.com A great pair of pyjamas is a wardrobe essential, and won’t wear out half as quickly as socks. Another of our 242 best Christmas gifts, this set was recommended by fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley, who writes: “There is something cosy and Christmassy about new PJs. I’d go for a men’s pair, sized down for women. This John Lewis set is ideal” – and at £32 it’s an excellent buy. *** Zipped babygrows Mori zipped sleepsuit, pack of 4, £97.50 (was £130) babymori.com This set of four two-way zipper babygrows is hailed as a life-saver in baby gear parents wouldn’t live without, and they’re great quality too, made from comfy, breathable organic cotton and bamboo fibre. The set is 25% off for Black Friday, although it’s even cheaper to buy them separately, now £22.75 each from Mori. Amazon doesn’t have the set, but has reduced the sleepsuits to £24 each. *** Soft baby sling Freerider sling, from £27.20 (was £58) freeriderco.com Freerider’s soft sling is another essential baby gear recommendation from parents, who love the comfort and freedom it gives them. The light grey and a couple of the patterned slings are now half price or less, while other colours get a more modest discount. *** Lace up boot Penelope Chilvers Bartholemew leather boot, £209 (was £279) penelopechilvers.com Lace-up leather boots have been part of the ultimate capsule wardrobe for centuries. This handsome design classic tumbles by £70 in the sale to a price that seems fair for a boot you’ll be wanting to wear every day. *** White trainers Superga 2750 white trainers, £68 (was £85) superga.co.uk amazon.co.uk This soft leather capsule wardrobe shoe offers the comfort of a slipper with a sole that’ll keep you dry. With £17 off it’s only a middling discount, but Amazon does also have Superga’s canvas Cotu Classic for 50% off at £25. *** Classic cigarette pants Jigsaw stretch cigarette trouser, £105 (was £140) jigsaw-online.com Jigsaw has taken 25% off everything for Black Friday – until Monday, that is – so this is a great chance to snap up one of two pairs of smarter trousers that feature in the ultimate capsule wardrobe. This classic has a timeless cut that makes it a fine fit for high days and everyday wear. *** Chanel-esque jacket Mango pocket tweed jacket, £55.99 (was £79.99) shop.mango.com We hadn’t set out expecting to find many Black Friday deals on clothes, but here comes another one from the ultimate capsule wardrobe: a versatile boxy tweed jacket that looks like Chanel and costs less than a pair of jeans. This excellent 30%-off deal covers all four colours: black, brown, ecru and a positively Santa-hued red. *** The high street’s best jeans Levi’s 501 Original jeans, £50 (was £100) levi.com “The most brilliant jeans in the world,” said our fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley of the legendary Levi’s 501s, which rode high in our list of 50 autumn wardrobe updates under £100. This fantastic deal sees the jeans that launched a thousand (well, a few) classic 80s and 90s adverts tumble to half price. You heard it through the grapevine (well, here). *** Dune block heels Dune ankle strap court shoes, £36-£63 (was £90) dunelondon.com Another one from 50 autumn wardrobe updates under £100, these fabulous and comfortable Dune shoes have dropped from £90 to various bargain prices depending on the colour you choose. The cheapest is the two-tone metallic edition, at £36, while the gorgeous burgundy is more expensive at £63 – still nearly a third off their usual price. *** Women’s snow boots Merrell Siren 4 Thermo boot, from £138.78 (was £180) amazon.co.uk With snow covering the country in November this year, these seriously protective Merrell boots are suddenly an essential – and we wouldn’t be surprised to see them sell out before Black Friday. Our fashion team’s guide to the best women’s footwear for autumn praised their toasty warmth, great traction and waterproof membrane, and said they’re light enough to wear all day. Prices are as low as £138.78 for the lovely moon colour edition. *** Men’s hiking boots Danner Crater Rim, £258 (was £430) danner.com It’s not often we see the very best deal offered by a brand’s own store, but Danner is an exception. The tough, heavy and incredibly durable Crater Rim boots wowed our walking boot tester Paddy Madison, but they’re normally wildly expensive at £430. This drop to £258 makes them relatively affordable. Given how many years these boots will last you, this is a genuinely good buy for keen walkers. *** Men’s summer hiking shoes Keen Arroyo II, from £68.81 (was £110) amazon.co.uk The Keen Arroyo shoes snuck into best men’s walking boots, despite looking more like sandals, because they offer good sole protection, support and traction on rough terrain. Their description of “waterproof” made our writer chuckle, though. The shoes still cost £110 at Keen at the time of writing, but Amazon has treated the black and brown model to a welcome discount of more than £40. *** Soft cabin bag Eastpak Tranverz cabin-size suitcase, from £63.80 (was £145) amazon.co.uk £101.50 luggagesuperstore.co.uk A soft but strong and durable cabin bag is the perfect travel companion, squishing into the carry-on allowance without damaging your stuff or bursting the bag’s stitches. Writer Liz Boulter chose this great-looking Eastpak bag for our roundup of 18 everyday essentials, and she said it’s still going strong after a decade of use. Well worth buying at its offer price, which is significantly lower than its average price of £110. *** Underwear subscription OddBalls monthly subscription, from £8/month (was £14) myoddballs.com Subscriptions and undies are two reliably good gift choices. Put them together and you get OddBalls, a quirky, high-quality brand that was set up to raise awareness of testicular cancer and is one of our 16 favourite subscriptions. For Black Friday, all subscriptions are 20% off, ranging from £8/month (was £14) for boxer shorts and socks to £144 a year (was £180) for bralettes and socks. *** Sports bra Sweaty Betty running bra, £32.50 (was £65) sweatybetty.com Sweaty Betty’s bra was one of our favourite sports bras in our best bras roundup. It has a high neckline and sturdy construction that make it ideal for high-impact sports such as running and boxing. Now half price, this is a great buy that should last you years. *** Satin skirt Ghost Luna satin slip skirt, from £27.60 (was £69) ghost.co.uk Our fashion writers voted this the only skirt you need in our guide to the ultimate capsule wardrobe. Joan Didion liked to pack two skirts for any trip, no doubt in black, but you’ll need to settle for lilac if you want the biggest discount. Most other colours, including black and navy, are £51.75 for Black Friday, but charcoal remains full price. *** Breton T-shirt Sunspel Classic T-shirt, £59 (was £85) sunspel.com Breton-striped T-shirts never go out of style, so this Sunspel classic was a cert for the ultimate capsule wardrobe. Made from ethically sourced Californian cotton, it should last years and is an excellent buy with 30% off. *** Crew neck jumper Rosh Crewneck, £221.25 (was £295) and-daughter.com Four out of five colours of this classic lamb’s wool winter warmer from the ultimate capsule wardrobe are reduced to £221.25 for Black Friday, although if you’re dead set on the navy, it’ll still cost you £295. Like many fashion stores, &amp;Daughter gives you an additional 10% off your first buy if you sign up for its newsletter. *** Dress Me+Em Travel Tailoring boat neck midi dress, £175 (was £250) meandem.com Another timeless classic from the ultimate capsule wardrobe, this tailored flared dress gets a sizeable 25% price cut from Me+Em. It’s comfortable, durable and versatile enough to style up or down, so we think this is a good buy – it’s just a shame that only the navy, and not the red, is available at the time of writing. *** Kids’ goalie gloves Adidas Predator goalkeeper gloves, from £9 (was £18) sportsdirect.com These fetching goalie gloves will protect young hands and help keep the opposition out. Fresh from our 242 top Christmas gifts, they’re now under £10 on Sports Direct but Amazon is still charging up to £25 for them. Sports Direct one, Amazon nil. • The article was originally published on 22 November 2024.

                    "headline": "Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’",
                    "bodyText": "As Elon Musk has embraced Donald Trump and various far-right conspiracy theories, he has left behind an aghast cohort of Tesla owners who suddenly feel embarrassed by their own cars. Many of them are now publicly displaying their dismay at Musk on their vehicles. Sales of anti-Musk stickers have boomed since the world’s richest man declared his support for Trump and helped propel him to victory in the US presidential election, as owners of Teslas, the car brand headed by Musk, try to distance themselves from the South African-born multibillionaire. “Sales have really spiked. The day after the election was the biggest day ever,” said Matt Hiller, a Hawaii-based aquarium worker who sells a range of stickers online that denounce Musk. “People saw a billionaire supervillain buy his way into the administration and it rubbed them the wrong way.” Hiller started the sticker range last year after deciding against buying a Tesla due to Musk’s “amplifying of horrible people and silencing of others” on X, formerly Twitter, another of his companies. Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy”, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words “Space Clown”. “People keep telling me that they feel they can drive their Teslas again with these stickers,” said Hiller, who has had to set aside part of his house to accommodate the growing operation. Hiller devises slogans such as “Elon Ate My Cat”, a reference to a debunked falsehood about migrants eating pets in Ohio, that are then sold on Etsy and Amazon. “People are shaken up. It’s a relief really to see they are awake,” he said of the surging demand. Musk, who has an estimated wealth of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most valuable car company in the world while warning that “climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI”. But his reputation among electric vehicle-buying liberals curdled as he used X to trumpet far-right conspiracies, fulminated about the “woke mind virus” and enthusiastically promoted Trump, even appearing at the president-elect’s rallies and funding campaign operations for him in key battleground states. Musk is now intimately involved in Trump’s incoming administration, heading a new “Department of Government Efficiency” that plans mass layoffs of US government workers. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. “I thought Elon was progressing our country, but he’s turned out to be kind of an evil person. It’s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,” said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years. “I still love my car, but I think about whether I’m endorsing that sort of behavior when I drive it. I’m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,” said Houston, who has bought an “Anti Elon Tesla Club” magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it. Pamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California’s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas. “I’m turning 80 in January so I thought I’d have a sporty car that I could race anyone when the light turns green,” Perkins said of her purchase. “There was a time I thought Elon Musk was a genius but he went bad very quickly. I remember saying to my husband I should sell this car and send a message, for my own conscience. “A lot of people have asked if I’m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. But [Musk] doesn’t care about us, he has bigger fish to fry. He wants to colonize Mars.” It’s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop forecast in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the much-hyped Cybertruck. “Tesla isn’t the only player in town now and they haven’t been aggressive in putting new products out,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “Elon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing. I don’t think we’ve seen any impacts in sales because of this – yet. I do think this will happen, but it remains to be seen which consumers he attracts and which he loses.” Another uncertainty is how Tesla will be affected by policies pursued by Trump. The incoming president has called the shift to electric cars “lunacy”, said that supporters of such vehicles should “rot in hell” and vowed to strip away incentives to purchase them. Trump has somewhat tempered his invective against electric vehicles following Musk’s endorsement but is still planning to remove a key tax credit for new buyers. For now, though, there is a windfall for those selling anti-Musk merchandise. “I feel like people really wanted to make their voices heard in some way, even as passive as it is,” said Stacey Davis, who started selling Musk bumper stickers a year ago. Davis, who has a Tesla, said she has had an 800% increase in sales of these bumper stickers on Etsy since the election. “Elon started not aligning with what I believe in and he just started being really weird, extra,” said Davis. “At first we’re like, OK, he’s just one of those eccentric types of people. But then when he went into his political stuff and I was like, oh no, this is not it.” With a Trump presidency looming over the US for the next four years, Musk’s involvement is a bittersweet prospect for some sellers. “I’d be happy for him to disappear from public discourse and just be another rich guy,” Hiller said. “If I never sell another Elon sticker that’s fine. I’d rather him just be gone for the country’s sake and I can go back to making stickers of fish.”"

                    "headline": "Badenoch suggests final Tory migration policy would be more radical than leaving European convention on human rights – as it happened",
                    "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives under her leadership are committed to having “a strict numerical cap” for immigration, “with visas only for those who will make a substantial and clear overall contribution”. During a speech and Q&amp;A at Westminster, she also called for more data to be published on “the real costs and benefits of different types of migration”. (See 3.53pm.) Asked about leaving the European convention on human rights, she said she did not view it as a “silver bullet”, but that leaving the ECHR was “not even the most radical thing that we probably will have to do”. (See 4.02pm.) Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have both declined to repeat the chancellor’s comments at the CBI conference on Monday, where she said she would not be “coming back with more borrowing or more taxes”. (See 2.10pm and 5.21pm.) Esther Rantzen, whose terminal cancer diagnosis led her to campaign for the legalisation of assisted dying, has issued an impassioned plea to MPs to vote this week on a “vital life-and-death issue”. Proposed cuts to England’s most beautiful landscapes pose an “existential threat”, the managers of the National Landscapes Association have warned. In her speech this afternoon Kemi Badenoch first raised a criticism of Keir Starmer first set out by the Guido Fawkes website. She said: The prime minister himself once said that there is a ‘racist undercurrent’ which ‘permeates all immigration law’. Starmer used that language in a review of a book published in 1987. Badenoch did not seem to consider the possibility that at that point Starmer might have been right. Two years ago Amelia Gentleman got hold of an internal Home Office report written by a historian exploring the causes for the Windrush scandal and it made precisely this point. The report, which has not been published, said: During the period 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK … As a result, the experiences of Britain’s black communities of the Home Office, of the law, and of life in the UK have been fundamentally different from those of white communities … Major immigration legislation in 1962, 1968 and 1971 was designed to reduce the proportion of people living in the United Kingdom who did not have white skin. The leftwing Byline Times was not allowed to attend the Kemi Badenoch speech, Adam Bienkov, its editor, says. He posted this on Bluesky earlier. Kemi Badenoch and Chris Philp are currently holding a press conference about immigration at a Tufton Street think tank. Byline Times was barred from attending At PMQs Keir Starmer refused to repeat what Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, told the CBI about future tax rises being ruled out. (See 2.10pm.) Reeves herself has also refused to repeat what she told the CBI. In an interview today, asked how she could guarantee “I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes” (which is what she told the CBI), Reeves replied: I’m not going to write five years’ worth of budgets in the first few months as chancellor of the exchequer. But what I can now say is that we have wiped the slate clean on their economic and fiscal mismanagement of the previous government. At the CBI conference on Monday Reeves did tell the audience that she would not be coming back “with more borrowing or more taxes”. But she was speaking off the cuff, not from notes, and the main point she was making was that she did not expect to have to deliver a big, tax-raising budget like October’s ever again. It did not sound as if she was making a pledge never to raise any tax, and it is likely that most people in the audience did not interpret her words as a cast-iron pledge of that kind. (In politics, as well as reporting what people say, it is also important to make allowance for what they mean.) Labour claims Kemi Badenoch’s speech on immigration this afternoon shows the Conservatives have '“learned nothing” from the their time in government. In a statement on the speech issued by the Labour party, Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, said: It’s welcome the Tories finally accept that immigration spiralled out of control on their watch. But Kemi Badenoch offers no new ideas or alternative to her party’s failed policies of the past. The Conservatives wasted hundreds of millions of pounds in taxpayers’ cash on the Rwanda gimmick, and it’s clear they would do it all over again. The Tories have learned nothing. The Proclaimers will perform at a memorial service for Alex Salmond taking place on St Andrew’s Day, PA Media reports. PA says: The service at St Giles’ Cathedral in Edinburgh will be streamed live from 11am on Saturday. Salmond, a pivotal figure in Scottish politics for several decades, died aged 69 on 12 October in North Macedonia after having a heart attack. A private family funeral was held near his home in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, on 29 October. The order of service for the memorial shows that as well as the Proclaimers – the rock duo from Leith – music will also be provided by singers Dougie MacLean and Sheena Wellington. A number of Salmond’s friends and political allies will give readings at the service, officiated by Rev Dr George J Whyte. Tributes will be delivered by Kenny MacAskill – a longtime ally of Mr Salmond who joined the Alba Party – as well as the former first minister’s lawyer Duncan Hamilton KC, and Salmond’s niece Christina Hendry. SNP MSP Fergus Ewing will read from The Wild Geese by Violet Jacob. Conservative MP David Davis, who shared a friendship with Salmond despite a political divide, will read from John 14. The Proclaimers will perform their pro-independence song Cap In Hand. But the Conservative press conference does seem to have riled Reform UK a bit. The party has issued this response from its leader, Nigel Farage. The Conservative party have broken their promises on immigration after the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 manifestos. Why on earth would I or anyone else believe them now. Kemi Badenoch suggested during the Q&amp;A that, without Reform UK standing at the last election, Labour would not have won. In response to a question about whether she was just making this announcement to address the rise of Reform UK, Badenoch said: I can say, hand on heart, that I share the frustrations of the British public, and in many cases, their anger. We need to fix this. The system is broken. We can’t just ignore it and pretend that the problem will solve itself. And what I am worried about is that Labour will assume that, because they’ve won, people like their immigration policy. Because people voted Refom, we have now got a Labour government. However, I think that there is a dissonance between what people want, which is lower and better migration, and what Labour is offering. You look at what they have done since they came in, they haven’t set out anything meaningful on immigration – a few slogans here and there about smashing the gangs, I think they had a press conference when they arrested one person, for example. This is not serious. Badenoch is certainly right to say that the rise of Reform UK at the election contributed to the scale of Labour’s victory. But that does not necessarily mean that, if Reform UK did not exist, the Tories would have won. Here is the full quote from Kemi Badenoch’s answer to Steven Swinford from the Times, who asked if Badenoch still thought that leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR) would not be an easy answer to the immigration issue. (See 4.02pm.) She replied: I’ve always said that leaving the ECHR is not the silver bullet. It’s not even the most radical thing that we probably will have to do. But if we’re going to leave the ECHR, we need to have a plan, not just a promise. There is a lot more that is going on in our immigration system beyond the ECHR, and what I don’t want to do is what has happened before, where politicians make promises quickly to get votes, and then things aren’t delivered. What you are going to see from us is a new approach – principles and policy based on a plan. Philp says he thinks the Rwanda model, which involved deporting all arrivals, is better than offshore processing, which involves taking people to another country to have their asylum claim processed, but successful applicants being admitted. Badenoch says the culture of the Home Office is important. It is not a charity. It should recruit people who are serious about reducing migration, she says. And that’s the end of the Q&amp;A. Q: [From Nick Gutteridge from the Telegraph] The French government has today said it would not arrest Benjamin Netanyahu if he came to France. What do you think of the government’s failure to say what it would do if Netanyahu came to the UK? Badenoch says she thinks that is wrong, but today she wants to talk about immigration. Q: [From Tamara Cohen from Sky News] Previous Tory leaders set a cap on migration. Why would your policy be different? Badenoch says past leaders just set an number. She would have a proper plan for reaching the number given, she says. Chris Philp says, with free movement, the government did not have full control when Britain was in the EU. He also says Britain needs an effective deterrent. Q: [From Steven Swinford from the Times] Do you still see leaving the ECHR as an easy answer? Badenoch says leaving the ECHR is “not even the most radical thing that we probably will have to do”. She says immigration policy does not just all revolve around leaving the ECHR. UPDATE: Badenoch said: I’ve always said that leaving the ECHR is not the silver bullet. It’s not even the most radical thing that we probably will have to do. But if we’re going to leave the ECHR, we need to have a plan, not just a promise. There is a lot more that is going on in our immigration system beyond the ECHR, and what I don’t want to do is what has happened before, where politicians make promises quickly to get votes, and then things aren’t delivered. What you are going to see from us is a new approach – principles and policy based on a plan. Q: [From Christopher Hope from GB News] Why should people trust you when your party completely “cocked things up” And will the cap be below 100,000? Badenoch says to win back trust, you have to admit you got things wrong. She says she has done that. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, gave a short speech. And now Kemi Badenoch is taking questions. Q: Are you still committed to reintroducing the Rwanda scheme? Badenoch says the Tories still think a deterrent is needed. She claims other people think the same. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has said she is in favour of offshore processing, she says. Q: Would you support a possible blasphemy law? Badenoch says she is against a blasphemy law. Badenoch ended her speech saying her party made mistakes on immigration. We can argue about the effects of migration on the economy, we can discuss the impact on public services and housing, and we haven’t done that enough. But fundamentally, this country is not a dormitory or a hotel. It is our home. We need to look after it. I want to rebuild the trust between the Conservative party and the British people. I know we have a lot of work to do, but the first step is to accept that mistakes were made and to learn from them. As the new party leader, I want to acknowledge that we made mistakes. Badenoch says the immigration system is broken. But her party will review all aspects of policy, she says. We will review every policy treaty and part of our legal framework, including the ECHR and the Human Rights Act, and in designing our detailed policies, we will put the following elements at the core: -a strict numerical cap, with visas only for those who will make a substantial and clear overall contribution; -a fully transparent approach publishing all the data, so that for the first time, everyone can see the real costs and benefits of different types of migration; -a reconsidered approach to citizenship and settlement, making the path to a British passport a privilege to be earned, not an automatic right; -zero tolerance for foreign criminals remaining in the UK; -and, of course, an effective deterrent for illegal migration. Overall, our plans will look at all immigration routes, family, study, asylum and work, and at all ways people can enter the UK. We will look at the access of migrants and any dependents to welfare and public services, and we will need to improve the data and economic modeling that decision makers rely on. Badenoch says the figures out tomorrow will show net migration falling, as a result of the decisions taken by the last government. But, under Labour, immigration will remain “far too high”, she says. The home secretary wants a returns agreement with the EU, but that’s the exact kind of agreement that saw us take more asylum seekers than were returned to the continent. So Labour won’t change anything. The prime minister himself once said that there is a racist undercurrent which permeates all immigration law, and of course, he and his cabinet fought against the end of free movement. They scrapped the Rwanda deterrent before it had even started, and we are already seeing the inevitable result as more and more people cross the Channel, with significantly more arriving than last year. Badenoch is setting out the principles behind her approach. First, if integration is too quick, there is no integration … It doesn’t matter whether you’re massively for immigration or massively against it. Without a shared national identity, our country will suffer. When people come here, they must buy into the values, customs and institutions that attracted them …. Second, the political class cannot pretend that immigration comes only with benefits and no costs, when we can all see the pressure on housing, roads, GPs and wages. We must be honest. The failure of politics over the last 30 years has been to gloss over it or make it a fringe issue. That has to stop. Third, we can no longer be naive. It’s nonsense that we have allowed a situation where judges deem safe countries to be unsafe, where loopholes are willfully exploited by opportunists, where the latest legal ruses and wheezes are sent around the world on social media. Kemi Badenoch is speaking now. There is a live feed here. She says immigration figures are coming out tomorrow. They will show net migration falling, as a result of decisions taken by the last government. She says, as an immigrant herself, she feels about to talk about this. Immigration is too high to sustain public services, and to integrate people from different cultures, she says. She goes on: It is time to tell the truth. For decades, the entire political class in this country has presided over mass migration. Since 1994 every year has seen more people arrive in this country than leave. She says the last Conservative government promised to cut immigration, but failed. Kemi Badenoch is giving a speech in Westminster this afternoon, which is due to start shortly. According to HuffPost’s Kevin Schofield, she will talk about immigration. He posted this on Bluesky. Kemi Badenoch will pledge to “review every policy, treaty and part of our legal framework….including the ECHR and the Human Rights Act”, in a speech on immigration this afternoon. She is also expected to say the Tories would introduce “a strict numerical cap” on the numbers entering the UK. The Conservatives have said that the new respect orders unveiled by the Home Office as a means of tackling antisocial behaviour are unnecessary. The Home Office announced the plans last week, saying “hooligans who wreak havoc on local communities will face tough restrictions” under the new orders. As PA Media reports, councils, police and social housing providers will be able to apply for respect orders, issued by the courts. Perpetrators could face town centre bans, or be compelled to address the root causes of their behaviour, for example, through mandated drug treatment, and breaches could result in up-to-two-year prison sentences, unlimited fines, or a community order. In a Commons statement on the initiative this afternoon, Diana Johnson, the policing minister, said: At its core, this is about respect – respect between citizens, respect for our society and the expectations underpinning it, and respect for the rule of law. Johnson said respect was “woven into the fabric of our democracy but after years of neglect, that fabric has become worn and we saw a disgraceful illustration of that in the summer, when serious disorder erupted in some towns and cities”. She went on: To turn things around and effectively combat the problem, it is really clear that fresh impetus is needed. But Matt Vickers, the shadow Home Office minister said the government was rejust reviving the “failed” asbos (anti-social behaviour orders) introduced during Tony Blair when he was PM. Vickers went on: I know that those in the sector have described the proposed respect orders as wholly unnecessary and near-identical to existing powers already held by the police. Vickers asked Johnson to explain how the new orders were different from asbos, or criminal behaviour orders (CBOs). Johnson replied: Respect orders are different to criminal behaviour orders – I don’t think [Vickers] has quite understood that. CBOs are attached to where there’s been a conviction and the CPS then apply in court for that CBO to be applied. Respect orders will not require a conviction. According to Aubrey Allegretti from the Times, the Labour MP Uma Kumaran has withdrawn her name from the amendment to the assisted dying bill motion saying it should not get a second reading and that there should be a full policy review instead. Update: Labour MP Uma Kumaran has withdrawn her name from an amendment to the assisted dying bill. It’s been described as a “wrecking amendment” and Labour MPs say some colleagues were misled about its intent During PMQs Keir Starmer accused Kemi Badenoch of having made unfunded spending commitments worth £6.7bn during her time as Tory leader. Here is the table from Labour justifying the figure (which the party did brief to the Mirror at the weekend). Labour has identified commitments worth a total of £6bn a year, and added another £700m for the cost of restarting the Rwanda scheme. Commenting on PMQs, Ellie Reeves, the Labour party chair, said: Kemi Badenoch has again been unable to explain whether she would reverse changes to employer NICs that pay for Labour’s investment in the NHS and education. Would she cut the funding for hospitals and schools which she claims to back? The opposition are all over the place. Nothing constructive, no new ideas. Just complaints and nothing to say about what they would do - all while running up an unfunded promises wish list of nearly £7bn in just three weeks. Completely unserious. SNP MPs will abstain on the assisted dying bill, Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg reports. NEW: undertsand the SNP’s 9 MPs will abstain on the Assisted Dying Bill on the basis it will affect England and Wales only Here is the news story PA Media has filed about the Starmer/Badenoch exchanges at PMQs. Keir Starmer has sidestepped calls to repeat chancellor Rachel Reeves’ pledge of no more borrowing or tax rises following the budget. The prime minister said he was “not going to write the next five years of budgets” at the despatch box in the House of Commons when challenged by Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch. In a series of tetchy exchanges between the pair, Badenoch also pressed Starmer on whether he would continue with a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030. Her question came after Vauxhall-owner Stellantis said it would close its van-making plant in Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, amid what it called the “stringent” UK zero-emission vehicle mandate. Starmer also dismissed a petition calling for a general election after Badenoch raised it and suggested he should resign. Speaking at PMQs, the Tory leader said: “At the CBI conference on Monday, the chancellor said – and I quote – ‘I’m clear, I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes’. I know that telling the truth to this house is important to the prime minister, so will he repeat his chancellor’s pledge now?” Starmer replied: “We set out our position at the budget, which was just set out. We’re fixing the foundations. We’re dealing with the £22bn black hole that they left. I’m not going to write the next five years of budgets here at this despatch box but we said we wouldn’t hit the payslips of working people. We’ve passed the budget. We’ve invested in the future, and we’ve kept that promise.” Badenoch claimed that Sir Keir was “not fixing any foundations, he’s making everything worse”, before adding: “The whole house would have heard him refuse to repeat the chancellor’s pledge, a pledge as worthless as the manifesto promises that he’s talking about.” Speaking ahead of PMQs, Reeves said she had “wiped the slate clean on the economic and fiscal mismanagement of the previous government”. She told broadcasters: “We have put our public finances on a firm footing and we have properly funded our public services, and our public services now need to live within the means that we have set them for this parliament.” Elsewhere at PMQs, Starmer defended the government’s approach to business and claimed the Tories “really haven’t got a clue what they’re doing” when it comes to policies. Badenoch countered: “To know what Conservatives would do, he should resign and find out. Until then, I’m the one asking the questions. There’s a petition out there, two million people asking him to go.” The Tory leader claimed deputy prime minister Angela Rayner’s employment rights legislation will “stop businesses hiring”. Starmer, in his reply, said: “She talks about a petition, we had a massive petition on July 4 in this country. We spent years taking our party from a party of protest to a party of government, they are hurtling in the opposite direction.” Badenoch described the response as “nonsense” and appeared to use the concerns of a biscuit company to aim a jibe at Rayner. She said: “Following his budget, the head of McVitie’s has said that it has been harder to understand what the case for investment in the UK is. So while the prime minister has been hobnobbing in Brazil, businesses have been struggling to digest his budget. Isn’t it the case that the employment rights bill shows that it is not only the ginger nut that is causing him problems?” John Swinney has warned opposition parties to put the public first as his minority government struggles to put together sufficient support ahead of next Wednesday’s Scottish budget. In a keynote speech in Edinburgh this morning, the first minister said: In a parliament of minorities, no political party is a bystander in the budget process – if there is no collaboration then there is no budget bill. The SNP leader, who is now governing as a minority after his predecessor Humza Yousaf ripped up the partnership with the Scottish Greens in April, added: “We can choose to be mired in party politics or we can choose to put first and foremost our duty to the people we represent.” With Labour unlikely to take up Swinney’s call for collaboration, the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats could get the budget bill over the line. The Greens want an end to the controversial council tax freeze, which is hitting struggling councils, while the Lib Dems want a commitment to stop spending on independence – unlikely to fly with the pro-independence Greens. Swinney told reporters afterwards that he was ready for an early election if necessary, but warned opposition leaders that blocking the budget would cause “disruption” to public services. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said the Vauxhall factory closure in Luton would be followed by more job losses. Responding to Jonathan Reynolds’ Commons statement (see 1.49pm), Griffith said: The closure of the Luton plant, I fear, is just a downpayment on jobs that will be lost under this government’s relentless attacks on industry, its neglect of the realities of business, and its failure to meet its promise not to raise taxes. The government owes it to the plant’s workers to at least be honest, this decision is the direct result of a government policy that is simply unworkable for industry. Stellantis told us as much when they said that this decision was made in the context of the zero emissions mandate. The government’s policy on zero emission vehicles is a jobs killer. They say they have been talking since July, so why today, this panicked U-turn when it’s already too late. Under the last government, we acknowledged that the previous vehicle mandate was too stringent. We took the decision to push this back, recognising the impact that it would have on industry. Reynolds replied: That is the single most dishonest statement I’ve ever heard. The simple truth was that it was too late after 14 years of failure to be able to put this right. So I just have to say to him with all politeness, he is out of touch with industry, he is out of touch with workers, he’s even out of touch with what the previous Conservative government did. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told MPs that the government had done everything it could to stop Vauxhall closing its van factory in Luton. In a Commons statement, he said: I found out about the challenges at this site just 10 days after the election, the global CEO told us he felt extremely frustrated by the lack of action from the previous government. We have done everything we possibly can to prevent this closure from happening. The secretary of state for Transport and I met Stellantis [the company that owns Vauxhall] many times over the summer and again on Tuesday morning to discuss the situation and the acute pressures the company is facing. We have worked hard to find a solution that would support the business and ensure people kept their jobs, and we confirmed in writing we were willing to consider any solution put forward. However, despite our best efforts, we have been forced to accept that this is ultimately a commercial decision by Stellantis as they respond to wider challenges within the sector. Reynolds said the decision to close the factory did not mean the company was leaving the UK. Whilst this announcement is not what we wanted nor what we worked towards, we must not mischaracterise this. It categorically does not signal a retreat by Stellantis from the UK. The plans announced by the company will also see them investing £50 million as they consolidate manufacturing at their Ellesmere Port plant. And he confirmed the government is “fast-tracking” a consultation on ending the sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. We will be shortly fast tracking a consultation on our manifesto commitment to end the sales of new purely petrol and diesel cars by 2030, but we will use that consultation to engage with industry on the previous government’s ZEV [zero-emission vehicles] transition mandate and the flexibilities contained within it, and we will welcome on board their feedback as we move forwards. Let’s start with two rightwing commentators and what they posted on social media before PMQs. Both suggested this was some sort of make-or-break moment for Kemi Badenoch. This was Dan Hodges, the Mail on Sunday commentator Important PMQs for Kemi Badenoch today. Needs to start properly landing some blows. And this was from Patrick O’Flynn. Can Kemi Badenoch take apart Keir Starmer at PMQs today? She needs a big performance after he dodged the occasion last week. Time to expose the many deficiencies of this Govt. This is probably Kemi’s final chance to make a strong early impression on the British public. Flynn is a former political editor of the Daily Express who went on to become a Ukip MEP. And did Kemi Badenoch take Keir Starmer apart? No, not at all. This was her third PMQs and, although none of them have hit disaster territory, they have all been relatively underwhelming. She has been getting good write-ups in the loyalist Tory papers, but beyond that she is not really leaving her mark. There are various reasons, some of which were on display today. In no particular order: 1) She does not seem to have worked out what line she wants to land. The leader of the opposition has six questions, but only one of them is likely to get clipped for the evening news, and it should be obvious which it is. With Badenoch, it isn’t. 2) She tries to do too much. Any PM will have lines they can use to respond to the first one or two questions on a difficult topic. Often an opposition leader does best when they persist, with intelligent, probing follow-ups. But we have not seen any of that from Badenoch, who does not seem to be strategising, and instead is just relying on six pre-scripted questions. 3) She goes over the top. She can’t resist ‘everything is terrible’ hyperbole, which might work in an Express leader conference, but much of the time is inherently implausible. She also conflates her ‘everything is broken’ under Labour thesis with her ‘everything is broken because Whitehall needs reform” thesis, which got an outing today (see 12.15pm), but is actually a different argument. Does it persuade the average floating voter? If it does, they are probably more likely to vote Reform UK. Another example of overkill today was Badenoch’s decision to call for Starmer’s resignation, citing a bonkers online petition (“There’s a petition out there, two million people asking him to go”). Badenoch is probably more of an online native than most of her leader of the oppositon predecessors, but she would do well to remember David Cameron’s wise words on this subject. 4) She is easily tripped up because her party is all over the place on policy. I confess, I had to Google the shadow science secretary (Alan Mak), but it turns out Starmer was right to say Mak has called for the employers’ NICs increase to be reversed. 5) She always sounds excessively patronising. 6) She can get blamed for the Conservative party’s dire record in office on public services. Admittedly, mostly this is not her fault. She did not even become an MP until 2017. She could deal with this by disowning some of what was done by her predecessors – and PMQs is a good place to do that – but she hasn’t. None of this means Badenoch can’t succeed in this format. It is still early days, and Labour would be mad to write her off now. But she hasn’t yet found a way of throwing Starmer off his stride in this area. After PMQs O’Flynn was reasonably encouraged. Much sharper from Kemi this week. Some good one-liners. That’s much more like it. But Hodges was not impressed. Kemi Badenoch started well by skewering Starmer on Rachel Reeves “no more taxes” promise. But then she lost her way, and stupidly raised that ridiculous petition. A couple of good lines, but she hasn’t got sufficient presence or gravitas at the Despatch Box. Whatever you think about Stephen Flynn and the SNP, the gulf in class between this question and Kemi Badenoch’s efforts was stark. Hodges also pointed out that Badenoch was wrong to say farmers did not protest after the last Tory budget. It turns out they did. Frank McNally (Lab) asks if Starmer agrees the SNP government has failed to get a grip on clinical waste disposal in Scotland. Starmer says the SNP government has the power to act, and the money to act. It is running out of excuses, he says. Charlie Maynard (Lib Dem) asks about the last government’s Brexit deal. Starmer says, if the government can improve it, it will. He says the government is “actively working on that”. Alex Brewer (Lib Dem) asks about GP services, and the prospect of cuts. Starmer says the last government was to blame for NHS underfunding. The budget alloccated more money for the NHS, he says. Amanda Hack (Lab) says the criminal justice system is on its knees. What will the government do to ensure it works for women and girls? Starmer says the system was broken, like everything else the Tories touched. Starmer mentions domestic protection orders, and the legislation on spiking, as just some of the initiatives that will help. Catherine Atkinson (Lab) asks if the government will support small businesses and high streets. Referring to Labour heckling, Starmer says Atkinson is talking about the Conservative government’s legacy. Brendan O’Hara (SNP) says the ICC’s decision to issue an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu has given the government a reason to end arms sales to Israel. Starmer says the government has set out its position. He says he supports Israel’s right to defend itself. Starmer says, if other MPs want to raise flooding issues, they should contact his office, and he will ensure they get whatever help they need. Harriett Baldwin (Con) asks if the government will fund better flood defences in her constituency. Starmer says the government is committed to tackling this. Money was set aside in the budget, he says. Rachel Hopkins (Lab) asks about the planned closure of the Vauxhall factory in Luton. Starmer says there will be a statement later. The government must do whatever it can to help workers, he says. Manuela Perteghella (Lib Dem) asks about knife crime, and measures that could better protect young people. Starmer says the government will look at measures, including bleed kits. He says he will arrange a ministerial meeting. Ian Lavery (Lab) says the government has delivered for miners in relation to their pension scheme. Will the government now hold an inquiry into policing during the miners’ strike? Starmer says the miners are entitled to the truth. The government is thinking carefully about what the next steps will be, he says. Neil Coyle (Lab) asks if his constituency can be a test area for the new respect orders. Starmer says he is glad Coyle has brought up the tough new measures. Harriet Cross (Con) asks about a family who have been farming in her constituency for 70 years. The budget changes will hit them hard, she says. What would the PM say to them? Starmer says if Cross writes to her about this case, he will look into it. He says the inheritance tax threshold for most farming families will be £3m. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says it is the BBC’s scam awareness week. Is the PM aware of anyone who has promised to decrease energy bills, only for them to increase? Or who promised to back business, only to tax them more? Starmer says it is good to see Flynn in this house (a jibe at Flynn’s announcement he wants to become an MSP). The SNP said it would improve life in Scotland, but hasn’t. So Flynn is the answer to his own question. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, asks about a constituent whose father died in great pain. Does Starmer agree that, whatever MPs decide on assisted dying, better end-of-life care is needed? Starmer says, whatever happens with the vote, the NHS needs proper investment. He wants it to give proper care, including at end of life. Davey says the energy price cap is rising. Millions of people are worried about this, including pensioners in poverty but above the pension credit limit. Will the PM reconsider winter fuel payments. Starmer says the long-term solution is clean power, which will drive down energy bills. On the winter fuel payment, he says Davey knows the government’s position. Imran Hussain (elected as Labour, but currently independent) asks about Islamophobia, including in the Commons. Starmer says the government is committed to tacking this problem. Badenoch says in government she changes the EV mandate. She says the budget was an attack on workers, pensioners, the young, charities and businesses. “The whole system is broken.” Isn’t it a good that the chancellor is an expert on customer complaints? Starmer says Badenoch is jumping on every bandwagon going. The government is taking the country forward, he says. Badenoch asks if Starmer will stand by his decision to ban the sale of petrol cars by 2030, even if jobs will suffer. Starmer says the EV (electric vehicle) mandates were introduced by the last government. And Badenoch was the business secretary who introduced them, he says. Badenoch says, when the Tories last had a budget, the farmers were not protesting outside. Starmer says Badenoch has made spending commitments worth more than £6bn. Badenoch says, if Starmer wants to see what a Conservative government would do, he should resign. She quotes criticism of the government and challenges Starmer to say it’s right. Starmer repeats the point about Badenoch not committing to reverse the NICS increase. And he says the Tories were divided last night on the tobacco bill, their legacy legislation. Badenoch says the government is making life worse. Why is business confidence falling? Starmer says Badenoch said herself on Monday she would not reverse the national insurance rise, while one of her shadow ministers was saying the opposite. Kemi Badenoch says the chancellor told the CBI conference she was not coming back with more taxes. Will Starmer repeat that? Starmer says he is not going to write the next five years of budgets. Chris Curtis (Lab) asks about residents in his constituency suffering as a result of a “fleeceholder” landlord. Will the government reform leasehold? Starmer agrees. The government will legislate, he says. Daisy Cooper (Lib Dem) says her local hospital trust has eliminated 65-week waits. That has happened even though staff are working in terrible buildings. She urges the governemnt to let the trust build a new hospital. Starmer says the new hospital programme inherited by Labour was a failure of the previous government. Keir Starmer starts by thanking people who have helped victims of the Storm Bert flooding. And he says the ceasefire in Lebanon is long overdue. It shows diplomacy can deliver, he says. PMQs is imminent. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. William Hague has achieved a rare Tory election victory; he has won the contest to be Oxford University’s next chancellor. The university has released the figures for the final round of voting, where the winner emerged after the final five candidates were ranked using the alternative vote system. The runner up was Elish Angiolini, the lawyer and academic. It was not a party political vote, but Hague, a former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, may take some consolation for seeing off three former Labour ministers. Angiolini was solicitor general for a Labour government in Scotland, but was retained in post when the SNP government took over because she was not seen as party political. Hague also beat Jan Royall, a former Labour leader of the Lords, who came third, and Peter Mandelson, who came fourth. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, was fifth. Here are tweets from three MPs who today have set out how they will vote on the assisted dying bill. Labour’s Paulette Hamilton says she is voting against. Suella Braverman, the former Conservative home secretary, is also voting against. But Labour’s Chris Murray will vote for the bill. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has poked fun at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, for missing the Commons vote yesterday on the bill that will gradually ban smoking, by progressively raising the age at which people can legally buy cigarettes. The tobacco and vapes bill passed its second reading by 415 votes to 47. All four of the other Reform UK MPs voted against but Farage, a strong supporter of smoking, missed the vote because he was presenting his GB News show. As the Mirror reports, Farage told his audience: I bet I get a load of stick for appearing on here at 7pm. Why? Because this afternoon we have a debate on the tobacco and vapes bill second reading. Believe you me, the Cromwellians are fully in charge.” The reason I’m not voting at 7pm is because it’s going pass with a majority of about 300 I think, and I think I’m better off here debating national issues on GB News in a situation like that. Retweeting the Mirror story, Streeting added this comment: Gutted. I thought he’d abstained because I’d won him over with my appeal to the libertarian right that there is no freedom in addiction - only higher costs to the individual and higher taxes for the general public. There will be two statements in the Commons today after PMQs. At 12.30pm Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, is making a statement about Vauxhall’s plans to close its van factory in Luton. And after that Diana Johnson, the policing minister, will make a statement about respect orders and anti-social behaviour. Dame Esther Rantzen has urged “as many MPs as possible” to attend Friday’s debate and listen to the arguments on both sides to make their minds up on assisted dying. Harriet Sherwood has the story. A reader asks: What happens if the Assisted Dying bill isn’t passed on Friday? It feels like momentum is shifting against it passing, but they may just be the news stories. Will the Govt pick it up and re-do with wider consultation etc, in line with some of the objections? Perhaps so, if the number of those indicating they would support a Bill with wider consultation, Govt sponsored etc is the difference between it passing and falling? Or is that it - finished for another 10 years or so? If MPs do vote against the assisted dying bill on Friday, I think the most likely outcome would be parliament losing interest in the topic for a decade at least. As a cause, it would certainly be finished for this parliament. But without a significant change in the composition of parliament, campaigners after the next election might well decide there is no point trying again. These issues can get settled for a generation; the alternative vote referendum took place in 2011 and the PR debate has still has not recovered. As you say, there do seem to be a lot of MPs who are not against assisted dying in principle, but who do want more debate, particularly with input from government about how assisted dying might be implemented. But it is very hard to see why the government would want to start that process after a vote against on Friday. That is why some people are arguing that the best option for those who want assisted dying to pass would be for the vote to be pulled on Friday, in return for a proper government review. The amendment tabled by cross-bench MPs seems designed to achieve this. But it would amount to a vote against the bill, and it would be seen by some as a vote against the bill in principle. Ministers have also been vague about what, if anything, they would do to throw government resources behind a proper view of this issue. With leadership from No 10, and proper consultation, the government probably could construct a decent Commons majority for assisted dying legislation with strong safeguards. Public opinion is there already. But at this point Keir Starmer does not seem to have the appetite for that. Whether that is because he is just biding his time, or because his personal support for the cause is weakening, or because he thinks it is just too much of a distraction for a government that should be focusing on the NHS and the cost of living, I don’t know. In her BBC Breakfast interview Kim Leadbeater also dismissed claims that, if her assisted dying bill gets a second reading on Friday, MPs won’t get enough time to consider the detail of it before it goes to the Lords. She said: The bill has been out there for nearly three weeks now. [MPs have] been looking at it in great detail. And I think the sense is that people think the right thing to do is to pass the bill at second reading, which would then mean we would go into the committee stage in the new year, where there would be hours and hours and hours of scrutiny of the bill. With government bills, MPs do get a lot of opportunity to consider and amend the legislation in subsequent stages before it goes to the House of Lords. But the procedural rules are slightly different for private members’ bills, which is why some MPs believe that, without the government intervening and providing more time for scrutiny, the Commons won’t be able to consider Leadbeater’s legislation properly. Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs in No 10 for the Conservatives, explains these concerns here. In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Kim Leadbeater said she expected the vote her assisted dying bill to be “very close”. MPs have been doing consultations with their constituents, holding events, holding round tables, doing huge amounts of amounts of research into this really important issue, and I think the vote will be very close. Election Maps UK is keeping a tally. Here are their figures from yesterday. Their forecast is based on assumptions about how people who have not definitely declared an intention might vote, and so it should be treated with some caution. In her Today programme interview Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who tabled the assisted dying bill rejected claims from a former lord chief justice that the legislation is flawed because it does not explain how judges would deal with hearings where they would have to decide whether or not to approve an assisted dying application. Asked about the comments from Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd in an interview on the same programme yesterday, Leadbeater said: Judges do these sorts of cases in other very delicate matters all the time. So they look at things like turning off life support machines for terminally ill people. So this is not going to be, it will be a new area of work for judges, but they are used to making these difficult and complex decisions and being part of this process. Leadbeater also said the bill was supported by four former directors of public prosecutions (DPPs) “who have got huge amounts of legal experience between them”. She was referring to Max Hill, Alison Saunders and Ken Macdonald, who have all spoken out recently in support of the bill, and to Keir Starmer, who voted for assisted dying in 2015, who has confirmed he remains in favour provided proper safeguards are in place, but who has said little about the Leadbeater bill because he wants the government to be seen as neutral. Good morning. We have got PMQs later, which means party politics will probably dominate for much of the day in the chamber, but increasingly MPs are preoccupied with a free vote, non-partisan matter, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday. This morning there are at least two interesting developments on that story. Three former Conservative prime ministers are all opposed to the bill, the Telegraph is reporting. The paper has a quote from Liz Truss who says: It is wrong in principle: organs of the state like the NHS and the judicial system should be protecting lives, not ending them. No doubt, as we have seen in Canada, vulnerable people would be put under appalling pressure to end their lives early. The law would be ripe for being exploited by the unscrupulous. MPs should vote this terrible bill down and instead focus on improving health services. The Telegraph has also been told that Boris Johnson does not support the legislation in its current form, and that Theresa May has not changed her mind since 2015, when she voted against an assisted dying bill. Normally three ex-PMs would be quite a lot, but these three only comprise half the Conservative party’s stock of former prime ministers and, as Sam Blewett writes in Politico’s London Playbook briefing, there are plenty of other ex-PMs yet to express a view. Added to Gordon Brown’s intervention last week, that makes four former PMs opposed to a change in the law. There’s still no word from Rishi Sunak, David Cameron, Tony Blair or John Major … or really from Keir Starmer, for that matter. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member’s bill being debated on Friday, has criticised the MPs who have called for the bill to be voted down to allow time for a full policy review. Four Labour backbenchers are among the seven MPs who have tabled an amendment to this effect. The amendment does not oppose assisted dying in principle. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Leadbeater said the amendment was “disappointing” because, if passed, it would stop the Commons voting on the substance of the bill. She explained: The route of the private member’s bill is absolutely the right route for taking this legislation through. That means that there can be a free vote by all MPs. It is not a government bill. The government has a neutral position on this and, sadly, the amendment that a handful of MPs have put forward is disappointing in that the public clearly want this debate to take place, and I think we’ve got responsibilities as parliamentarians to make sure that that debate does take place. Leadbeater also said she did not accept that argument that parliament needed more time to consider the issues before having a vote. In terms of time and scrutiny, look, this is not a new debate. This debate has been going on for decades. It’s been going on, as you quite rightly said, particularly in recent years, in no short part to due to high-profile campaigners like Esther Rantzen. But I think we can already see from what’s happened in the last few months, this bill will receive more scrutiny and more discussion and more debate, probably, than any piece of legislation. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes data about domestic abuse in England and Wales. Morning: Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, are due to visit a mental health charity in London. Noon: Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs. After 12.30pm: Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, makes a statement to MPs about Vauxhall’s plans to close its van factory in Luton. Afternoon: Starmer is due to do an AI-related visit in London. 3.30pm: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.

                    "bodyText": "Over millennia, debating the issues of the day has evolved as a rite of passage to graduate from university in Europe and parts of the Muslim world. A town square in the ancient world might not be the most obvious place to tackle the challenges of artificial intelligence facing universities. But the oral tradition of viva voce, which from Latin translates as “word of mouth”, is being adopted as a more accurate way to test knowledge in the age of chatbots, cheating and commercialisation. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Dr Chris Della Vedova, a senior lecturer of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at the University of South Australia, first noticed problems with essay and multiple choice exams when students were forced online at the start of the pandemic. “With digital exams, we didn’t really know if anybody knew anything, which made it hard to assess,” he said. “It was rare to fail students unless they didn’t complete them [exams].” So, his team pivoted – trying out a new format of 20-minute conversations where assessors would draw from a random pool of questions based on material covered in lectures. Students would answer, and the assessor would then ask a series of follow-up questions requesting them to expand on their answers, or to put their ideas in the context of the course as a whole. UniSA began using the viva voce system in 2022, replacing the final written exam for a range of its science degrees with oral assessments instead. In an age where generative AI can generate complex responses in seconds, there have been zero academic integrity breaches since the format was implemented. Vedova says conversation-based assessments are helping lecturers better determine their students’ understanding of subject content because of the “fluid, personalised nature of a conversation”. “Often you’ll ask the first question and get a good memorised answer, but we want to make sure they understand what they’re saying, so follow-ups give the opportunity to gauge how solid their understanding is,” he said. “When students are nervous or unclear, we can give them prompts – have them step back, whereas in an exam they might look at a question and leave it blank.” It’s not without its challenges. A professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales, Toby Walsh, said the format may unfairly disadvantage students who use English as a second language or introverted people who dislike public speaking. Vedova conceded that international students – who made up between 15% and 30% of science courses – did worry about the oral format. But he said practice activities built confidence and spoken communication skills were not being assessed. “Most of these students are going into health professions where interactions will be verbal,” he said. Vedova said he was “more confident” he could work out what they understood by sitting and talking to them. “There’s no reason it can’t work at any university in the age of generative AI, where there’s a lot we can’t really trust any more. “With a 10-page essay, you have no idea where it’s come from.” But there are practical barriers. “Viva voce is what we reserve for the highest examinations we do – PhDs – to see what they’ve done, and I’m very supportive of it, it’s fantastic,” Walsh said, adding: “But it doesn’t scale very well. With a sit-down exam, you have hundreds of students completing it at once. Orally, you can only examine one. “My colleagues using more oral examinations are always running into the problem that a first year undergraduate course has thousands of students, [and] they don’t have the staff. “It’s difficult to compare students. With an exam, there’s one comparison, but oral exams may go in a different direction.” An artificial intelligence expert, Dr Stefan Popenici, says that in smaller cohorts oral examinations are the “perfect form of assessment”. But he says the method is in direct conflict with the model of “commercialised higher education”. “If we want to have graduates able to read and write, it’s important to consider alternative forms of assessment,” he said. “You can’t cheat in front of a panel – you have to say what you know. Students clicking a button? That’s scary.” Is there a third way? For Walsh – it is the open-book exam. “Why do we get people to remember stuff if they can look it up in the real world?” he said. “We should set things that are challenging, accepting the fact everyone has access to the knowledge. Make it so it requires expertise on top of tools.”"

                    "bodyText": "When better to hold a conference on artificial intelligence and the countless ways it is advancing science than in those brief days between the first Nobel prizes being awarded in the field and the winners heading to Stockholm for the lavish white tie ceremony? It was fortuitous timing for Google DeepMind and the Royal Society who this week convened the AI for Science Forum in London. Last month, Google DeepMind bagged the Nobel prize in chemistry a day after AI took the physics prize. The mood was celebratory. Scientists have worked with AI for years, but the latest generation of algorithms have brought us to brink of transformation, Demis Hassabis, the chief executive officer of Google DeepMind, told the meeting. “If we get it right, it should be an incredible new era of discovery and a new golden age, maybe even a kind of new renaissance,” he said. Plenty could dash the dream. AI is “not a magic bullet,” Hassabis said. To make a breakthrough, researchers must identify the right problems, collect the right data, build the right algorithms and apply them the right way. Then there are the pitfalls. What if AI provokes a backlash, worsens inequality, creates a financial crisis, triggers a catastrophic data breach, pushes ecosystems to the brink through its extraordinary energy demands? What if it gets into the wrong hands and unleashes AI-designed bioweapons? Siddhartha Mukherjee, a cancer researcher at Columbia University in New York and author of the Pulitzer prize-winning The Emperor of All Maladies, suspects these will be hard to navigate. “I think it’s almost inevitable that, at least in my lifetime, there will be some version of an AI Fukushima,” he said, referring to the nuclear accident caused by the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Many AI researchers are optimistic. In Nairobi, nurses are trialling AI-assisted ultrasound scans for pregnant women, bypassing the need for years of training. Materiom, a London company, uses AI to formulate 100% bio-based materials, sidestepping petrochemicals. AI has transformed medical imaging, climate models and weather forecasts and is learning how to contain plasmas for nuclear fusion. A virtual cell is on the horizon, a unit of life in silicon. Hassabis and his colleague John Jumper won their Nobel for AlphaFold, a programme that predicts protein structures and interactions. It is used across biomedical science, in particular for drug design. Now, researchers at Isomorphic, a Google DeepMind spinout, are beefing up the algorithm and combining it with others to accelerate drug development. “We hope that one day, in the near future actually, we will reduce the time from years, maybe even decades to design a drug, down to months, or perhaps even weeks, and that would revolutionise the drug discovery process,” Hassabis said. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has gone further. Beyond designing new drugs, AI speeds recruitment to clinical trials, reducing a potentially years-long process to months. Fiona Marshall, the company’s president of biomedical research, said another tool helps with regulators’ queries. “You can find out – have those questions been asked before – and then predict what’s the best answer to give that’s likely to give you a positive approval for your drug,” she said. Jennifer Doudna, who shared a Nobel prize for the gene editing tool, Crispr, said AI would play “a big role” in making therapies more affordable. Regulators approved the first Crispr treatment last year, but at $2m (£1.6m) for each patient, scores will not benefit. Doudna, who founded the Innovative Genomics Institute in Berkeley, California, said further AI-guided work at her lab aims to create a methane-free cow by editing the microbes in the animal’s gut. A huge challenge for researchers is the black box problem: many AIs can reach decisions but not explain them, making the systems hard to trust. But that may be about to change, Hassabis said, through the equivalent of brain scans for AIs. “I think in the next five years we’ll be out of this era that we’re currently in of black boxes.” The climate crisis could prove AI’s greatest challenge. While Google publicises AI-driven advances in flooding, wildfire and heatwave forecasts, like many big tech companies, it uses more energy than many countries. Today’s large models are a major culprit. It can take 10 gigawatt-hours of power to train a single large language model like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, enough to supply 1,000 US homes for a year. “My view is that the benefits of those systems will far outweigh the energy usage,” Hassabis told the meeting, citing hopes that AI will help to create new batteries, room temperature superconductors and possibly even nuclear fusion. “I think one of these things is likely to pay off in the next decade, and that will completely, materially change the climate situation.” He sees positives in Google’s energy demand, too. The company is committed to green energy, he said, so the demand should drive investment into renewables and drive down costs. Not everyone was convinced. Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a former director of the US Department of Energy’s Office of Science, said advances in AI could drive suffering, adding that nothing raised the concern more than energy demand. She called for ambitious sustainability goals. “AI companies that are involved in this space are investing a lot in renewable energy and hopefully that will spur a faster transition away from fossil fuels. But is that enough?” she asked. “It actually has to lead to transformative change.”"

                    "bodyText": "Microsoft has launched a new book imprint with the aim of printing faster than traditional publishers. Named after an Intel microprocessor, 8080 Books will publish titles focused on technology, science and business. The imprint aims to “accelerate the publishing process, shortening the lag between the final manuscript and the book’s arrival in the marketplace,” reads a company statement. “Technology has quickened the pace of almost every industry except publishing,” it adds. “We know that more important ideas and arguments can travel faster than they do at the moment. Can they travel too fast? Of course, that already happens in abundance, but we seek to strike the right balance.” The first title from 8080, No Prize for Pessimism, by Microsoft’s deputy chief technology officer Sam Schillace, is available now. The book explores the need for optimism when creating technology products. Its second title, Platform Mindset, is written by Marcus Fontoura, previously technical fellow and corporate vice-president at Microsoft, and will be available later this year. The imprint anticipates that many of its writers and readers will be “current, former, and future Microsofties” as well as customers, researchers and policymakers. However, along with Microsoft writers, it hopes to “showcase minds and ideas from outside the company” and is “especially interested in new and nontraditional writers and thinkers”. It is not currently accepting unsolicited manuscripts. 8080 also plans to reissue “significant works” and out of print books that remain relevant. The imprint said its initial topics of focus will be “technology and the future; business process and productivity, and societal priorities in law, ethics, and policy.” It said it will experiment with technology to “accelerate and democratise” book publishing, and is building a “rigorous” editorial process which will involve spotting “meritorious” ideas and arguments quickly, assisting with manuscript development, inviting internal and external reviews and meeting “style and substance standards”. The imprint will “cover the costs of utilising publishing professionals” and donate the remaining revenue to nonprofits through Microsoft Philanthropies. This week, it was revealed that Microsoft had struck a deal with HarperCollins to use some nonfiction books it publishes to train an AI model, with the permission of authors."

The company “has reached an agreement with an artificial intelligence technology company to allow limited use of select nonfiction backlist titles for training AI models to improve model quality and performance”, it said in a statement shared with the Guardian. “While we believe this deal is attractive, we respect the various views of our authors, and they have the choice to opt in to the agreement or to pass on the opportunity,” it added. The move comes after US children’s author Daniel Kibblesmith revealed last week that he had been offered $2,500 (£2,000)for permission to use one of his books published by HarperCollins to train AI models. Kibblesmith published a series of screenshots of an email from the agency that represented his 2017 book Santa’s Husband in a post on the social media site Bluesky. The email states that titles would be licensed for three years, “with certain protections concerning credit and limits of verbatim usage per AI response”. According to the email, the terms are non-negotiable and have been “agreed to by several hundred authors”. It also says that HarperCollins has been required to keep the “company’s identify [sic] confidential”, but that the agency has “good reason to believe it is a major and respected company”. While HarperCollins says that the deal will involve nonfiction titles, the book Kibblesmith was approached about, Santa’s Husband, is a children’s fiction book. “HarperCollins has a long history of innovation and experimentation with new business models,” the company said in its statement. “Part of our role is to present authors with opportunities for their consideration while simultaneously protecting the underlying value of their works and our shared revenue and royalty streams. This agreement, with its limited scope and clear guardrails around model output that respects authors’ rights, does that.” In a follow-up to the screenshots, Kibblesmith encouraged people to “direct any outrage toward the incredibly doable action of purchasing physical books by living authors from local bookstores.” In April, it was announced that HarperCollins would partner with AI audio company ElevenLabs to produce audiobooks for its foreign language business that would not otherwise be created. At the time, the publisher said that while it would “continue to devote time and resources to voice actor-led productions”, AI would be “leveraged as a complementary tool to enable a broader number of audiobooks for backlist series books in non-English markets”."

                    "bodyText": "US justice department officials plan to ask a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser to dismantle the monopoly it has over the internet search market, in a major intervention against one of the world’s biggest tech companies. The Department of Justice (DoJ) last month filed court papers saying it was considering enforcing “structural remedies” to prevent Google from using some its products. The DoJ will reportedly push for Google, which is owned by Alphabet, to sell the browser and also ask a judge to require new measures related to artificial intelligence as well as its Android smartphone operating system, according to Bloomberg. Competition officials, along with a number of US states that have joined the case against the Silicon Valley company, also plan to recommend that the federal judge Amit Mehta imposes data licensing requirements. Google has said it will challenge any case by the DoJ and said the proposals marked an “overreach” by the government that would harm consumers. If Mehta accepts the proposals, they could drastically reshape the global online search market, of which Google controls 90%, as well as the company’s role in the fast-growing AI sector. In the UK, the competition watchdog has dropped an investigation into Google’s partnership with Anthropic, the US company that makes the Claude series of AI models. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decided that the arrangement, which involved a $2bn investment by Google, did not amount to it acquiring material control of Anthropic. The investigation had been launched amid concerns about the concentration of AI power in the big tech companies. The action against Google in the US follows a court ruling in August in favour of the DoJ that found that the company had violated antitrust laws and spent billions building up an illegal monopoly. The DoJ’s filing last month said Google’s conduct had resulted in “pernicious harms” to users, and that the importance of restoring competition to a market that was “indispensable” could not be overstated. The case against Google was filed under the first Donald Trump administration and continued under Joe Biden. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice-president of regulatory affairs, said the DoJ continued to push a “radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case”. “The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.” The case has echoes of the US government’s attempt to break up Microsoft in the 1990s in an effort to challenge its dominance over the software market. In 2000, a judge ruled in favour of the DoJ and said the company would have to be split in two but this was successfully appealed against by Microsoft a year later and the justice department eventually dropped its case. Google is to submit its proposed remedies in response to the DoJ by 20 December. On its examination of Google’s partnership with Anthropic, the CMA said it had found that Google had not acquired the ability to materially influence Anthropic’s commercial policy and therefore the partnership did not meet the threshold for UK merger control to apply. Joel Bamford, the CMA’s executive director of mergers, said: “This is another decision by the CMA which provides greater clarity for businesses and their investors. “We know fair, open and effective competition unlocks opportunities for investment and supports innovation in important markets like these, and it’s through merger reviews that we can appropriately assess the nature and impact of complex partnerships such as the one between Google and Anthropic.” The watchdog also said its so-called turnover test was not met, as Anthropic UK’s turnover does not exceed £70m. Anthropic said last month that its Claude AI model can now perform computing tasks including filling out forms, planning an outing and building a website."

                    "bodyText": "Meta’s push to deploy its artificial intelligence system inside Britain’s public sector has taken a step forward after the tech giant awarded development funding to technology aimed at shortening NHS A&amp;E waiting times. Amid rival efforts by Silicon Valley tech companies to work with national and local government, Meta ran its first “hackathon” in Europe asking more than 200 programmers to devise ways to use its Llama AI system in UK public services and, one senior Meta executive said, “focused on the priorities of the Labour party”. The event came after it emerged that Palantir, another US tech company, has been lobbying the Ministry of Justice and government ministers including the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Microsoft also recently agreed a five-year deal with Whitehall departments to supply its AI Copilot technology to civil servants. Meta’s hackathon was addressed by Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and now Meta’s president of global affairs based in California. The UK AI minister, Feryal Clark, said “government can adopt AI, such as Meta’s open-source model, to support our key missions”. Asked what was in it for Meta to provide the free technology, Clegg said: “It is in the long run indirectly in our interest to see this ecosystem of Llama-based innovation because it then makes it much easier for us to reincorporate innovations that are out there into our own products.” The Silicon Valley push comes amid concerns about the safety of AI, particularly in public services where clients may lack expertise or be too stretched to carry out due diligence. But Clegg argued that fears about the risks of AI were overblown. “Who knows, maybe AI will start developing a mind of its own and will start wanting to turn us into paper clips by next Tuesday,” he said. “But I think that right now, the technology is way more primitive than a lot of the fears suggest.” Clark played down fears Labour might impose stringent red tape, saying that while it would not “shy away from the significant risk AI represents” the government would “make sure that any regulation we introduce is proportionate, supports innovation and does not place undue burden on business”. Last week Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science and technology, admitted the government was treating the tech giants with “humility” as they outspent the British government on investment in innovation. “We are having to apply a sense of statecraft to working with companies that we’ve in the past reserved for dealing with other states,” he said. The moves to push Meta’s open-source AI platform for use in the public sector follow rising concern at the influence of tech giants. The role played by Elon Musk’s X platform in the US presidential election and the involvement of social media in inflaming the August riots in the UK added to the concerns. Asked about the approach of Meta, which runs Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Clegg drew a clear contrast between Meta and X over how content is handled. “Our practices are completely different,” he said. “If you look at the UK riots, most of the people who caused a real problem were figures like Tommy Robinson, who has long been banned from our platform, or Andrew Tate. That’s not the case on Telegram, not the case on X.”"

                    "bodyText": "It’s the new badge of celebrity status that nobody wants. Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey and Kylie Jenner have all had their voices cloned by fraudsters. Online blaggers used artificial intelligence to fake the Tiggerish tones of Martin Lewis, the TV financial adviser. And this weekend David Attenborough described himself as “profoundly disturbed” to have discovered that his cloned voice had been used to deliver partisan US news bulletins. Now experts have warned that voice-cloning is outpacing the law as technologists hone previously clunky voice generators into models capable of emulating the subtlest pauses and breathing of human intonation. Dr Dominic Lees, an expert in AI in film and television who is advising a UK parliamentary committee, told the Guardian on Monday: “Our privacy and copyright laws aren’t up to date with what this new technology presents, so there’s very little that David Attenborough can do.” Lees is advising the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee in an inquiry that will look at the ethical use of AI in film-making. He also convenes the Synthetic Media Research Network, whose members include the firm making an AI version of the late chatshow interviewer Michael Parkinson, which will result in an eight-part unscripted series, Virtually Parkinson, with new guests. That voice-cloning project is being done with the consent of Parkinson’s family and estate. “The government definitely needs to look at [voice cloning], because it’s a major issue for fraud,” Lee said. “It needs the stick of government regulation in order to deter [misuse] … we can’t allow it to be a free-for-all.” AI voice cloning scams were up 30% in the UK in the last year, according to research by NatWest bank this month. Another lender, Starling bank, found 28% of people had been targeted by an AI voice-cloning scam at least once in the past year. Voice cloning is also reportedly being used by fraudsters to perpetrate a version of the “hi mum” text scam, in which fraudsters pose as children needing their parent to send funds urgently. On already fuzzy telephone lines, detecting that a pleading child is a scammer’s clone can be hard. Consumers are advised to check by hanging up and calling back on a trusted number. People whose voices are cloned without their consent find it more than a nuisance. Attenborough told the BBC on Sunday: “Having spent a lifetime trying to speak what I believe to be the truth, I am profoundly disturbed to find that these days my identity is being stolen by others and greatly object to them using it to say what they wish.” When a new voice option on OpenAI’s latest AI model, ChatGPT-4o, featured tones that were very close to those of the actor Scarlett Johansson, she said she was shocked and angered as the voice “sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference”. The rise of cloned voices raises the question of what they miss about real human tones. Lees said: “The big problem is that AI doesn’t understand emotion and how that changes how a word or a phrase might have emotional impact, and how you vary the voice to represent that.” The voiceover industry, which provides voices for adverts, animations and instructional training, is having to respond quickly to technological advances. Joe Lewis, the head of audio at the Voiceover Gallery in London, which has provided real human voices for adverts for Specsavers and National Express, said it had already cloned the voices of some of its artists. He said AI seemed to work best with English male voices, perhaps because that reflected the bias in the type of recordings that had been used to train the algorithm, but he cautioned that in general “there’s something about the way it is generated that makes you less attentive”. “When the AI [voice] breathes, it is a very repetitive breath,” he said. “The breaths are in the right place, but they don’t feel natural … [But] can it get to the point when it’s really perfect? I don’t see why not, but to get to the full emotional spectrum is a long way off.”"

                    "bodyText": "Paying a premium for a flight during the school holidays or a cab at peak hours might be expected but fluctuating charges – otherwise known as surge pricing – could become the norm in other industries, say experts. According to Omar Merlo, the academic director of strategic marketing programmes at the Imperial College Business School, surge pricing – widely known as dynamic pricing – is when retailers adjust their prices in response to supply and demand, meaning customers are charged higher prices when demand spikes. The Wardour Street branch of O’Neill’s pub in Soho, central London, has implemented an additional £2 charge to pints ordered after 10pm. This means a pint of Brewdog IPA that costs £7.40 during the day will cost £9.40 after 10pm. The policy has been in place since 2022 to comply with the licensing requirement for more security staff. Some customers expressed their disappointment on social media at the price bump. One wrote on X: “This new idea of dynamic pricing is ridiculous, greedy and needs calling out. Very shortsighted.” However, another noted that charging more during busier periods was similar to discounts and offers at quieter times. “I was going to say I thought it was awful, but is it not simply ‘happy hour’ in reverse? ” Though it has angered many, O’Neill’s is not the first to introduce surge pricing. Dr Florian Stahl, a professor of marketing from Mannheim Business School, said this pricing model was likely to permeate into other areas, such as festivals and the energy sector. “We can expect surge pricing to expand into several industries in the UK, particularly in sectors with fluctuating demand patterns,” he said. “This might include public transportation, where prices may increase during peak travel times or major events like concerts and festivals.” Here are other industries that have implemented a form of surge pricing. Ride-hailing apps The cost of a cab using ride-hailing apps changes frequently but Uber and Bolt also practise surge pricing. Isabella Coolican, an associate in the competition team at Freeths law firm, said prices tended to become more expensive on Friday or Saturday evenings, during bad weather or after a concert or sports match because the demand exceeded supply. “This is why the same routes on an average Tuesday morning may be half the price,” she added. According to Merlo, these cab-hire services “use surge pricing fundamentally to make sure that people who order a car are those that really need it” and to “get the drivers out when they are most needed”. “If I’m desperate for that Uber car when it’s crowded, I’m quite happy to pay more … and when I get it, I’m happy that I get it. If it gets too expensive, maybe you’re happy to jump on a tube instead.” Airlines and hotels Airlines have long used dynamic pricing models to determine the cost of flights. This is why trips during peak season tend to cost more. Hotels also use seasonal pricing, which involves adjusting prices based on the time of year. This was typically linked to demand, said Stahl, and was an area that surge-style pricing might creep further into. “Hotel prices in major cities or tourist destinations can fluctuate due to high demand during peak tourist seasons, events, or local holidays. In the hotel and accommodation industry, surge pricing might be implemented in real time based on demand, weather or last-minute bookings, affecting both hotels and short-term rental platforms like Airbnb.” Hospitality Restaurants, bars and pubs may increase prices during busier times such as celebrations or match days. However, this is something we might see on a more regular basis, Stahl said. Stonegate Group, Britain’s largest pub group and owner of chains including the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates’s, said it was raising prices at 800 of its venues during peak times, such as weekends, to help cover costs, including staffing. A pint of beer during the busiest periods would cost drinkers 20p more. It has previously done so during special events, such as World Cups. However, many venues offer happy hours or discounted lunch menus during less busy hours. These types of deals enticed customers and boosted sales during quieter periods, Stahl said. “These offers often include reduced prices, ‘buy one, get one free’ deals, or specials on select beverages. In contrast, lunch menus are available during midday hours and focus on offering discounted or fixed-price meals, often with smaller portions or limited choices to provide quick, affordable options.” Concert tickets Music venues have a limited capacity, so when it comes to tickets for some of the biggest performers, demand outstrips supply. Many Oasis fans were furious after some of the tickets for their upcoming reunion tour jumped by more than double the price due to being in demand. Shows were initially advertised at £148.50, but when fans finally reached the front of the queue, often after hours of waiting, many found that basic standing tickets had gone up to £355.20. Merlo said consumers often became frustrated if they felt they were not getting value for money. “Usually, if [people] perceive that they are getting more value, they are willing to pay more. With the Oasis ticket debacle, they just got a higher price, and so that leads to this kind of disappointment.” Theme parks To deal with a post-Covid shortfall, there may be more surge pricing applied to prices at theme parks. This year, Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Legoland, Madame Tussauds, and Alton Towers, said it planned to introduce surge pricing so families would pay more on peak summer weekends than weekdays. The system will use machine learning to flex prices in response to supply and demand – in a similar way to that deployed by cut-price airlines, cab-hailing services and some hotels. Utilities and bills Another area Merlo said we could see dynamic pricing was in energy and utilities, particularly because of the adoption of smart meters and internet of things devices. The watchdog Ofgem launched a consultation this year to decide whether to introduce a “dynamic” price cap, under which British households would be charged based on the time of day they use their energy. During busier periods, energy suppliers could charge more for electricity, but customers could also save money at quieter times. This kind of surge pricing model would probably apply only to customers with smart meters on variable tariffs, Ofgem said. According to Merlo, “with the availability of data, the availability of technology, we’re going to probably see [dynamic pricing] more and more. AI technologies are allowing for a lot of these contexts in which dynamic pricing is being used to be expanded.”"

                    "bodyText": "Was that the week that marked the death of X? The platform formerly regarded as a utopian market square for exchanging information has suffered its largest exodus to date. Bluesky, emerging as X’s newest rival, has amassed 16 million users, including 1 million in the course of 24 hours last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have quit the former Twitter since Donald Trump’s election victory on 6 November. The catalyst is X’s owner, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who transformed the social media site and used it as a megaphone to blast Trump into the White House. The US president-elect said Musk would head the new Department of Government Efficiency, the acronym for which, Doge, is a pun on the dog internet meme and the Dogecoin cryptocurrency, started as a joke by its creators, which jumped in value after Musk dubbed it “the people’s crypto” in 2021. Musk now sits at the heart of the US government, yet requires no Senate approval for his actions and can continue to work in the private sector. He’s allowed to keep X and his 204 million followers, as well as head his electric car company Tesla and rocket company SpaceX. For the first time in history, a big tech billionaire is now shaping democracy not just indirectly, via his media, but directly. “I’m not aware of any precedent for this approach,” said Rob Enderle, president of the technology analyst firm Enderle, who has worked with companies including Microsoft, Sony and Dell. As recently as 2022, Musk tweeted that “for Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.” He tweeted that “Trump would be 82 at end of his term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America.” Months later, when Musk bought Twitter for $44bn, he fired content moderators and charged for account verification, which meant people could buy influence. Twitter was rebranded to X, shed millions of users and reinstated Trumps’s account, suspended after the White House insurrection in January 2021. The proliferation on X of alt-right diatribe, hate speech and bots, as well as Musk’s own clash with the UK government during the riots in August, have led to mounting disquiet among X users. The Guardian and Observer announced last week that their presence on the site was now untenable and they would no longer post. Stephen King, the author, left, saying it had become “too toxic”. Oscar-winners Barbra Streisand and Jamie Lee Curtis have departed the platform. “X has become effectively Truth Social premium,” said Mark Carrigan, author of Social Media for Academics, referring to Trump’s hard-right social media platform. And the talk in technology circles is that Trump’s Truth Social could be folded into X. If that happens, whose interests take priority? Would Musk suppress criticism of the authoritarian governments he does business with, or promote it? In the Donald and Elon media show, who is the puppet or paymaster? “If that happens, it will be the ultimate amplification machine for Trump’s ideas – a political super-app masquerading as social media,” said James Kirkham of Iconic, which advises brands including Uber and EA Sports on digital strategies. “Forget Facebook or Fox News; the true heart of the GOP’s digital strategy could be X.” “I’m expecting X and Truth Social to merge,” said Enderle. “But this could be one of the efforts that will come between Musk and Trump, given how overvalued Truth Social now is.” The bromance between the world’s two biggest egos is mutually beneficial only as long as the two transactional, power-hungry and impulsive men play nice. Trump is hawkish on China, one of Tesla’s most lucrative markets. Trump essentially campaigned against electric car manufacturing. Trump is protectionist; Musk opposes tariffs. On climate change, they are opposed. Jonathan Monten, a political science professor at UCL, is sceptical over the durability of their relationship.“Musk’s use to Trump was both private money and providing a platform, or using a platform, to a more favourable pro-Trump line,” he said. “It’s unclear what continued purpose or use Musk actually has to him. Yes, it’s sort of this celebrity story, but that’s Trump’s brand. He has one celebrity story today and tomorrow we’ll have another.”The early 2010s were the halcyon days of Twitter when activists, artists, lawyers, academics, policymakers, journalists and specialists of every flavour could connect, share information, exchange ideas and follow events in real time. It would be easy to portray Musk as the bogeyman, but some argue that it was TikTok and the advent of the algorithmic timeline that fundamentally destroyed Twitter. As social media began optimising for scale and for profit at the expense of user experience, algorithms prioritised the “best” content – the content that shouted loudest or was most specifically tailored to users. Curated accounts to follow, and “most recent” content, fell by the wayside. “As much as I think Musk has acted in harmful ways, I think part of this is about the logic of social media platforms as they evolve,” said Carrigan. “The consequences of an advertising-based model incentivise certain ways of organising the platform that create negative effects.” Bluesky, which became the most popular app on the app store on Friday, is the choice for X refugees, although its 16 million users pale in insignificance compared to Meta’s Threads, which reported reaching 275 million monthly active users, and X with about 317 million.. For some tech nerds, the X-odus is not something to mourn, but could herald the era of decentralised social networks they have been dreaming of known as the “Fediverse”. Advocates of the “Fediverse” argue that there should be one account for any social media network in the same way that Gmail accounts can email any email addresses, or mobile numbers call users on any other network. In walling off social networks so users can’t leave, the platform has the power. Instead, newer social networks including Bluesky are being built on “ecosystems” that enable them to interconnect. No one knows what will happen to X, with predictions ranging from collapse, to flipping to an anti-Trump platform if Musk and the president lock horns, to becoming a training ground for Musk’s xAI venture. AI could gobble up social media, and xAI is valued at $40bn – almost the price Musk paid for Twitter."

                    "bodyText": "Steven Johnson has a reputation as a research software nerd. The author of 13 nonfiction books, he’s constantly looking for digital tools to streamline his creative process. So when large language models – which power text-generating AI tools such as ChatGPT – started getting attention, he was most interested in what they could mean for organising information. In 2022, an article Johnson wrote about LLMs for the New York Times caught the eye of researchers at Google Labs, the tech company’s experimental AI arm, who came to him with a proposition: would he help them develop the kind of digital research assistant he’d been dreaming of? The result is NotebookLM, a note-taking tool that uses AI to help organise, summarise and answer questions about any information you give it. “The way we think about it is it’s a tool for understanding things,” Johnson says. Generative AI has been eagerly adopted in the productivity tech space, with new and existing tools promising features that can help streamline your schedule, simplify emails and take notes more effectively. I’ve generally been sceptical of such products, assuming that by the time I’ve fiddled around to get them set up, I’ve probably negated most of their productivity benefits. But with a new generation on the scene, I wondered if my workflow couldn’t benefit from an AI boost. Could these tools actually deliver some of the advantages claimed by AI acolytes, automating more humdrum aspects of work and leaving me free to focus on creative endeavours? I approached NotebookLM with caution, noting the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen: “NotebookLM may still sometimes give inaccurate responses, so you may want to confirm any facts independently.” As a journalist, I’m wary of AI’s tendency to “hallucinate”. But NotebookLM differs from text generators such as ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini in that it only works with the information you provide. You can start a new “notebook” for a project and upload up to 50 “sources”. These can include pdfs, audio files (which it automatically transcribes), .txt files, web links and Google Docs. I tried uploading notes and interview files for a story I was working on, then asked the “Notebook guide” – an AI assistant – to produce a briefing doc based on their content. I immediately saw the appeal. The brief summarised key points raised from hours of audio and drew links between my sources. It even pulled out key quotes. Using the AI chat function, I interrogated the material further, asking which findings were most surprising and posing specific questions about the content. Rather than trawling through my transcripts to remember which interviewees had made a particular point, I simply asked: “Who spoke about [X topic]?” and got a detailed summary of who said what – along with footnotes directing me to the exact wording in the original material. It’s the restriction at the core of NotebookLM – using only the information you provide – that makes it so useful. I could see it being adopted by students and knowledge workers of all stripes. Johnson says he has a notebook for his next book, where he stores ideas and asks the guide to suggest chapter structures or key characters. “That’s kind of like a targeted brainstorming notebook,” he says. He also has one for the NotebookLM project itself, where he collates announcements and memos. He used the guide to draft a press release for a new feature, and got it to come up with its own tagline: “Think smarter not harder.” There are drawbacks. The guide gives long answers to queries, which results in a lot of text to wade through, and I found a level of subjectivity creeping into the AI-generated summaries (it deemed my interview with Johnson “fascinating”). This was particularly evident in the “Audio Overview” option, a much-hyped feature that creates a 10-minute AI-generated podcast based on your sources. It’s fairly mind-blowing at first: it truly sounds like two podcast hosts knowledgably discussing the subject matter. But I found that it extrapolated from my material, making value judgments that didn’t necessarily reflect the original content. NotebookLM definitely saved me time locating information, but productivity is not just about efficiency. Johnson believes the tool can aid creativity on a deeper level. He has one notebook that he calls his “everything notebook”. It contains thousands of quotations he’s collected from ebooks over the past 25 years, and he’s slowly adding the text of all the books he’s written. He then treats it like an extension of his memory, using the AI chat to resurface topics of interest or draw connections between sources. “It’s incredibly good at just being like: ‘Oh yeah, 15 years ago you read that article about ant colonies,’” he says. * * * This idea of outsourcing or expanding brain power is a common theme in productivity circles. The metaphor of a “second brain” comes up a lot. “The concept of the second brain is effectively a way that enables you to have another product that does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, freeing you up for more high-value work,” says Robbie O’Connor at San Francisco-based productivity platform Notion. O’Connor used to work on Google Maps and compares the second brain idea to how that app supercharged our navigational capabilities. “It gave you a lot more power, a lot more freedom, a lot more reliability,” he says. Notion offers a suite of organisational tools, with diverse templates for note-taking including a to-do list, project planner and budget, as well as AI features. It also has a calendar app and last month announced an upcoming email app. I found it overwhelming when I logged in – I usually just write a to-do list on paper. As I gamely started filling out a weekly to-do list, habit tracker and project planner, I couldn’t help but feel I was procrastinating rather than actually doing the work I was planning. A big part of Notion’s appeal, however, is its collaborative features when adopted across teams; working solo, I missed out on these benefits. Another note-taking product, Capacities, is more intuitive, if still somewhat intimidating. This launched in 2022 and recently got a boost after being recommended by Casey Newton, a tech journalist and productivity tool power-user. Capacities’s big idea is to do away with the traditional file-and-folder computer storage system. Instead, notes are classified by type as “objects” – for instance, a book, pdf, person, weblink, image or document. You can then organise and link these objects by collating them or adding tags. The idea is that you should be able to rediscover relevant notes more easily; they get more organised over time, rather than having a single defined location from the start. “There’s no point in storing and organising stuff if it doesn’t help you in the end,” says co-founder Steffen Bleher. There’s also an AI assistant. I started collecting objects, noting down story ideas and dropping in interesting links. It was a good way to keep things in one place; usually I would jot ideas in the Apple Notes app and bookmark links in my browser. But after using Capacities for a while, I found I didn’t have that many notes to benefit from its information-networking approach. It was clear it would require long-term commitment to get the most out of it. For Bleher, Capacities is basically a lifestyle choice; he uses it for both professional and personal purposes, adding thoughts about books he’s reading and ideas that come out of discussions with friends. A video tour by co-founder Michael von Hohnhorst shows him jotting down reflections on a podcast he has just listened to and saving favourite quotes and recipes. I can’t imagine documenting my life to this degree. A Capacities blogpost states: “Building a second brain takes discipline.” Perhaps this is what I lack. Bleher acknowledges that a small cohort of productivity power-users are dwarfed by a much longer tail of people who just want a solution to a specific workflow problem they are having. Even though he clearly falls in the first camp, he takes a pragmatic view to adopting new tech. “Many people fall in this productivity trap that they need to have crazy setups and they need to do more stuff, and in the end they basically procrastinate and then they don’t get anything done,” he says. Anna Gurun, an associate director at HSM Advisory, a future-of-work advisory group, echoes this sentiment. “The big challenge is confusing productivity with busyness,” she says. You might tick off lots of tasks in a to-do list app but are you actually achieving what you need to? Your AI calendar might organise your schedule but are you still spending too much time in unnecessary meetings? “If you’re not clear in the outcomes you want to reach then you’re not going to be able to use the tool effectively,” she says. Productivity also has a more emotional side, she adds, which tech tools can’t really help with. Maybe you’re less productive because you’re sleeping poorly or you have just been through a bad breakup. The apps can also make failure seem bigger, she says: “You sort of magnify behaviour.” These words came to mind as I looked back at a calendar tool I’d been trying out. There are many smart scheduling tools out there – I opted for Reclaim.ai, owned by Dropbox. It syncs with Google Calendar and, when used by teams, optimises the best meeting times to suit all attenders. It also has several simple but sensible features, including the ability to automatically add a “decompress” buffer after meetings that include a video link and the option to input “habits” – regular tasks you want to reserve time for. I set a daily habit to spend an hour working on that novel I keep meaning to write, which Reclaim.ai dynamically found time for around my other obligations. At first, having the calendar reminder was a good motivator, but I soon realised I’d been far too ambitious. However sophisticated the features, no scheduling tool can create more hours in the day, or force me to actually do the work. As AI gets smarter, though, it may be able to take care of more of those irksome little tasks that distract from what we really want to spend time on. The next trend is for AI “agents” – a step on from a chatbot, with the ability to actually take action. This month, AI company Anthropic demoed an experimental AI model that can automatically fill in a web form by finding data from across someone’s computer. Google is reportedly developing an AI agent that could autonomously book a flight or make an online purchase. Rahul Vohra, founder and chief executive of email app Superhuman, says this approach will come to productivity tools. Superhuman already has AI features to help write, summarise and reply to email, and recently added one that automatically makes calendar events based on emailed details. AI agents could do more. “You can imagine an AI agent that triages on your behalf, that schedules on your behalf, that even writes and one day sends fully written emails on your behalf,” he says. Want to set up a meeting or negotiate a contract? Have your bot speak to my bot."

Figuring out how to stop them from hoovering up your data to train their AI isn’t exactly intuitive. Left to their own devices, more than 300,000 Instagram users have posted a message on their stories in recent days stating they do not give Meta permission to use any of their personal information to inform their AI. To be clear, just like the Facebook statuses of yore, a simple Instagram post will not do anything to stop Meta from using your data in this way. Default opt-ins are an industry-wide issue. A recent report by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on the data practices of nine social media and streaming platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Amazon found that nearly all of them fed people’s personal information into automated systems with no comprehensive or transparent way for users to opt out. “Overall, there was a lack of access, choice, control, transparency, explainability and interpretability relating to the companies’ use of automated systems,” the FTC report reads. In most cases, you can opt out. If you use tech companies’ sites and apps, they will probably still collect your data, but you can prevent it from being fed into their automation machines. To make it easier for you, we’ve gone through the painstaking process of figuring out how to pull your data out of the hungry AI machine on a bunch of the major platforms so you don’t have to wade through endless settings and blocks of text to figure it out yourself. While some opt-out processes were straightforward once we knew what we were looking for, others were much more convoluted. By far, Meta was the most difficult platform on which to find ways to protect our data. And if you’re in the US, there is currently no way to stop the company from training its AI on your information. X, formerly Twitter, changed its terms of service in November to require users to grant permission for AI training. Some other sites didn’t offer any ways to opt out. For instance, there are no visible settings on YouTube or Reddit that would allow us to protect our posts and content from being used to train the companies’ own AI or other firms’ models because of the public nature of those platforms. Another thing to remember: even if you refuse to permit AI models to train themselves on your personal information or posts, any AI chatbot will probably add the prompts you feed it to its corpus of training data. X (updated) Previously, X allowed you to opt out of letting your data be used to train its AI model, Grok. No more. When we originally published this story, X let you opt in and out of the company’s AI training. Our guide walked you through all the steps. But starting on 15 November, a new terms of service agreement goes into effect that eliminates that option. So if you use the social network and agree to the new terms of service, you are agreeing to allow the company to “analyze text and other information you provide” to train the company’s machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. That is, of course, unless you’re in the EU where data protections are much stronger than they are in the US. X paused the processing of its users’ posts for AI training purposes if they were published between 7 May and 1 August 2024 in accordance with rules from the bloc’s Data Protection Commission. However, this applies to EU and EEA member countries only. Gmail Google-owned Gmail offers a product called Smart Compose, a predictive text machine that uses your own emails, chats and video content to help figure out what you might say next. You may have noticed it if you’ve ever seen suggested sentences or words pop up as you’re typing out an email. This content is automatically used to “personalize” your experience across Google products, not just in your email. Think Google Docs, Google Slides and YouTube. It’s unclear whether and how your email and chat content is being shared with third-party advertisers or entities. It’s even less clear whether that data is being used to inform how other people’s emails are personalized. You can, however, opt out of letting Google use your email and chat data to train Smart Compose. You can do this easily from your desktop browser or the Gmail app on your phone. Desktop browser: Find your settings – it’s a button that looks like a gear at the top right corner of your inbox. This will pop out a menu bar called Quick Settings. Click on “see all settings” below that. Then scroll down to “smart features and personalization”. To the right of that, there will be a button that says “turn on smart features and personalization”. If you haven’t already opted out, it will be clicked on by default. Uncheck the box. This will turn off all “smart” features, including Google’s ability to use your email content to personalize ads shown to you. iPhone: In your Gmail app, tap on the buttons with three lines to the left of the search bar. That will pull out a menu that starts with “all inboxes”. Scroll down to Settings, which is in the last section of that menu. This will bring you to a new Settings page. Scroll down to Data Privacy. Once you click on that, turn off smart features and personalization. It will show you a pop-up of all the features you will be turning off. Click “turn off features”. Google Docs Once you’ve opted out of letting your email and other data be used in Smart Features, head on over to Google Docs, where the company has also automatically enabled predictive text. To disable this, you’ll have to open a new document. From the document page, scroll over to “tools” in the top menu under the title of the document. Scroll down to “preferences”. There, you can disable Smart Compose, Smart Reply and other smart features. LinkedIn As of two weeks ago, with little heads-up, LinkedIn automatically opted users in to letting their personal data and content train generative AI models. If you decide to remain opted in, your data will also be used to train the generative AI models of LinkedIn affiliates – a term the company does not expand on. If you’re in the UK, LinkedIn has stopped using your data to train its AI systems at least for the moment. For everyone else in places like the US, you can opt out! A word to the wise: LinkedIn says opting out will not have any bearing on whether your direct interactions with any AI features will be used to train it, so keep that in mind as you use any LinkedIn AI features. From the home page on either the mobile app or desktop browser, click on the icon of your profile picture. On your desktop it will be in the top right corner and will be labeled “me”. On your mobile app it will be in the left corner. There you’ll scroll down to settings, which will bring you to a second menu. In the browser, it’ll say “settings and privacy”. In the mobile app, you’ll click on “data privacy”. In the first section on that page, “how LinkedIn uses your data”, the last option will say “data for generative AI improvement”. Click that and toggle the switch off. Meta OK, this one was a doozy. The first thing to know is that if you’re in the US, you can only request that the company delete your personal information that you included in your chats with Meta’s generative AI machine. There is not a button to just shut it off, and in the US and many countries outside of the EU and UK where there are fewer comprehensive privacy regulations, you actually have no way to opt out. The second thing to know is that trying to find the form to request that Meta delete your data is incredibly convoluted, not at all obvious and required reading through huge chunks of text. I even had trouble retracing my steps. I felt dejected. If you want to skip all the steps and go straight to the form, fortunately we were able to get you a direct link. Click here to get directly to the form. If you’re in the US and interested in trying to find it yourself, go to your settings from the Instagram app (it should be in the top right corner of your profile). From there, go to “settings and privacy” and scroll down to the section that says “more info and support” (the last section). Hit the “about” button. Then go to the privacy policy. Once you’re on that page, click on the menu button on the right. From there, click on “other policies and articles”, which will give you a few options. You want to tap on “how Meta uses information for generative AI models and features”. This will bring you to a very densely worded post detailing how Meta uses your information for generative AI. Now, you’ll have to scroll down to the “privacy and generative AI” section. At the end of the sixth paragraph in that section there is a link that says “Learn more and submit your requests here.” That’s where you’ll find the form. If you don’t want to go through all that mess, here’s the direct link that, at least for the time being, will bring you straight to the request form. Unfortunately, the burden to protect your data is still squarely on your shoulders and, depending on your local laws, there’s no way to completely stop the company from using it to train their AI. Meta specifically says that it will not automatically fulfill your requests to delete your personal information from its AI systems just because you submitted the form. The request form also asks for screenshots and proof that your personal information appeared in responses to prompts you sent to any of Meta’s AI models. It is unclear why Meta does not keep track of whose data it uses and when and why the onus is on you to provide that evidence. We have submitted some requests without any screenshots or proof to see how the company will respond. We will update when we get a response. If you’re in the US, you can click here to get directly to the form. If you’re in the EU or UK, where there are stronger privacy laws, you can go to your settings from your Instagram account. It should be in the top right corner of your profile. From there go to settings and privacy and scroll down to the section that says “more info and support”, the last section. Hit the “about” button. Then go to the privacy policy and click on “learn more about your right to object”. Even in the EU and UK, that form does not automatically shut off Meta’s ability to use your data to train its AI. The form only promises that the company won’t use your public information from Facebook and Instagram for its AI features “if your objection is honoured”. The company also says it may still use information about you to improve or develop its AI even if you don’t use their products or otherwise object to its use. An example Meta gives includes if your face shows up in pictures that someone else has posted on Facebook. Snap Snapchat has a chatbot called My AI that is powered by OpenAI and uses information you share with the app to train it. As with other platforms, if you engage with the chatbot directly, that information may be retained and used to train it. But there’s other data, including your location, that is being used to inform the chatbot depending on your settings on the app. If you share your location with Snapchat generally, that location will also be used by My AI, according to the company’s website. If you don’t want to give the AI system access to your location, you will have to revoke Snapchat’s access to your location. But even once you’ve revoked the location permissions, your location information might still be cached by the app, so you’ll have to delete your data from My AI. On iOS: In your phone settings, scroll down to the list of apps you have downloaded on your phone and click on Snapchat. From there, click on “location” and hit “never”. Then you’ll want to open the Snapchat app. Click on your profile picture, then click on the settings icon in the top right corner of the page. Scroll down to “privacy controls” and click on “clear data”. Then click on “clear my AI data”. On Android: After long-pressing on the Snapchat icon, tap “app info” then “permissions” then hit “location”. Then choose “deny”. Then, similar to on iOS, you’ll need to go into the app, click on your profile picture and open up the settings menu. From there, scroll to “account actions” and tap “clear my AI data”. My AI has also been accessing your Snapchat story by default. If you want to revoke that access, go to the chat tab in your Snapchat app and click on the conversation with My AI. Tap on the My AI profile picture and click on the settings icon in the top right corner (it is three dots). Click on privacy settings and toggle off the button next to “my story”."

                    "headline": "‘A fork in the road’: laundry-sorting robot spurs AI hopes and fears at Europe’s biggest tech event",
                    "bodyText": "This year’s Web Summit, in Lisbon, was all about artificial intelligence – and a robot sorting laundry. Digit, a humanoid built by the US firm Agility Robotics, demonstrated how far AI has come in a few years by responding to voice commands – filtered through Google’s Gemini AI model – to sift through a pile of coloured T-shirts and place them in a basket. It wasn’t a seamless demonstration but the enthusiastic response, nearly two years on from the launch of ChatGPT, reflected the excitement about all things AI that pervaded Europe’s biggest annual tech conference. Talk of a bust in the AI boom could not be heard over the shouts of encouragement for Digit as it pondered different shades of garment. Nonetheless, the voices of caution were there, discussing familiar themes such as safety, jobs and the climate, as AI comes to influence a huge range of industries. Here are some of the event’s discussion points about AI. Job security A key debate was: if millions of jobs are going to be displaced by AI, will they be replaced by new roles for humans as the technology creates fresh opportunities? The possibility of entry-level jobs becoming casualties of displacement was raised a lot. Speakers talked about these jobs being affected in professional industries such as law, finance and even tech because AI tools, particularly AI “agents” that can carry out tasks autonomously, will be able to do relatively simple work, such as initial checking of contracts or handling queries from potential clients. Sarah Franklin, the chief executive of Lattice, a US tech firm that provides a platform for company HR departments, said the shape of workforces would change as a result. Entry-level jobs formed the base of a workforce that narrowed as people filtered upwards into management and executive roles, she said. “AI can make this more of a diamond shape, where the entry levels are harder to get.” She added: “The pace of innovation is outpacing education. That is a dangerous future if we don’t rapidly invest in ensuring that everyone is proficient with AI, especially entry-level workers.” And then there is the question of replacing those eliminated jobs. Digit is being used in warehouses by GXO, a US logistics company, to lift boxes and place them on conveyor belts. According to the chief executive of Agility Robotics, Peggy Johnson, a new role could be created managing teams of Digits doing physical work. “Employees who were previously doing this physical work, appreciate the fact that they can hand that off to Digit,” she said. “Then it allows them to do a number of other things, one of which is to be a robot manager.” The climate AI’s impact on the climate, most notably through the energy-hungry datacentres used to train and operate AI models, prompted warnings that competition for energy supply could pit tech firms against communities. “I think there are real concerns to be raised about the implications for the climate and the implications for local communities that are also dependent on these energy infrastructures,” said Sarah Myers West of the AI Now Institute, which produces AI policy research. She added that coal plants were being kept open to meet energy demand for datacentres in the US, while renewable energy resources could be diverted to AI firms and related infrastructure rather than for broader public use. Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, acknowledged the issue in a keynote speech. “We can’t afford to just build datacentres and consume electricity without regard for what it means for a local community or for a country or for planet Earth,” he said. Microsoft admitted this year that energy use related to its datacentres was endangering its “moonshot” target of being carbon negative by 2030. Startups were a feature of the summit and climate-oriented investors regard the AI boom as a source of demand. Shawn Xu, a partner at the US-based Lowercarbon Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in companies combating the climate crisis, said datacentres were “an opportunity to expand clean energy”. Lowercarbon’s investments include the UK business InRange, which connects rooftop solar sites to datacentres. Edith Yeung, a general partner at the US VC firm Race Capital, said energy would be a focus of investment next year. “For 2025, AI strategy is energy strategy. It is a very critical pillar for AI infrastructure.” Safety For all the AI boosterism, the event gave prominence to Prof Max Tegmark, a leading voice in the warnings about unrestrained development of the technology. Tegmark, an AI specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a sizeable crowd that the industry was at a “fork in the road” where it could develop artificial general intelligence – AI systems that match or exceed human intelligence – that resulted in a “reasonable chance we’ll all be dead in 10 years” or living in a “dystopia” where humans are totally disempowered. Will AI replace the creators? The Peaky Blinders creator, Steven Knight, said creative professionals would be at the “forefront” of a battle between AI and humanity. However, computers would lose because they could not create the unexpected, he said. The issue was highlighted last month when it emerged the UK broadcaster ITV was advertising for a £95,000-a-year job involving the use of AI to “shape the future of content creation”. Knight described AI’s approach to creative work as “taking previous experience, precedent, and presenting it in a different way”, and said the human approach to art souunded similar, but was “more than that”. “When a creative human being creates something new, the reason it works is because it’s not expected.” Knight was speaking alongside Marco Bassetti, the chief executive of the TV production group Banijay, which has launched a creative fund for ideas using AI. “There are a lot of things that AI can do in order to improve creativity. It can cut a lot of time in finding an idea,” he told the Guardian. However, he added, humans still had the edge, and compared AI to a tool that helps make the finished product. “If you have a brush, it doesn’t mean you are able to do a painting.” However, one experienced creative figure pointed to the emergence of AI products, such as Runway, that can generate convincing video images quickly. “I think you’re going to see an enormous negative impact on the WPPs of the world and the big [advertising] holding companies. It’s not that they haven’t understood what’s going to happen, but would your start point really be: ‘I’ve got 100,000 employees who have no experience in AI’? No, it wouldn’t be,” said David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI to create marketing campaigns. Where next for the boom? There was talk of the race to ever-more-powerful AI slowing, after reports that initial tests of unreleased models have been underperforming relative to expectations. The recent breakthroughs have been more than enough to spur the launch of new companies, such as the British biotech startup Healx, which uses AI to search for cures for rare diseases, and Luminance, another UK firm, that offers companies a tailored AI model to do legal work. Kanu Gulati, a partner at Khosla Ventures, a California VC firm whose investments include the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, said companies were emerging that, even if they didn’t build the models, were taking advantage of them. This was a key – and necessary – development for investors and tech firms looking for a return on their multibillion dollar investments in AI breakthroughs. “New business models can now get created,” Gulati said."

                    "bodyText": "Back in 2022, when ChatGPT arrived, I was part of the first wave of users. Delighted but also a little uncertain what to do with it, I asked the system to generate all kinds of random things. A song about George Floyd in the style of Bob Dylan. A menu for a vegetarian dinner party. A briefing paper about alternative shipping technologies. The quality of what it produced was variable, but it made clear something that is even more apparent now than it was then. That this technology wasn’t just a toy. Instead its arrival is an inflection point in human history. Over coming years and decades, AI will transform every aspect of our lives. But we are also at an inflection point for those of us who make our living with words, and indeed anybody in the creative arts. Whether you’re a writer, an actor, a singer, a film-maker, a painter or a photographer, a machine can now do what you do, instantly and for a fraction of the cost. Perhaps it can’t do it quite as well as you can just yet, but like the Tyrannosaurus rex in the rear vision mirror in the original Jurassic Park, it’s gaining on you, and fast. Faced with the idea of machines that can do everything that human beings can do, some have just given up. Lee Sedol, the Go Grandmaster who was defeated by DeepMind’s AlphaGo system in 2016 retired on the spot, declaring AlphaGo was “an entity that couldn’t be beaten”, and that his “entire world was collapsing”. Others have asserted the innate superiority of art made by humans, effectively circling the wagons around the idea that there is something in the things we make that cannot be replicated by technology. In the words of Nick Cave: Songs arise out of suffering … the complex, internal human struggle of creation … [but] algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer … What makes a great song great is not its close resemblance to a recognisable work. Writing a good song is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite. It is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past. It’s an appealing position, and one I’d like to believe – but sadly, I don’t. Because not only does it commit us to a hopelessly simplistic – and, frankly, reactionary – binary, in which the human is intrinsically good, and the artificial is intrinsically bad, it also means the category of creation we’re defending is extremely small. Do we really want to limit the work that we value to those towering works of art wrought out of profound feeling? What about costume design and illustration and book reviews and all the other things people make? Don’t they matter? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Perhaps a better place to begin a defence of human creativity might be in the process of creation itself. Because when we make something, the end product isn’t the only thing that matters. In fact it may not even be the thing that matters most. There is also value in the act of making, in the craft and care of it. This value doesn’t inhere in the things we make, but in the creative labour of making them. The interplay between our minds and our bodies and the thing we are making is what brings something new – some understanding or presence – into the world. But the act of making changes us as well. That can be joyous, and at other times it can be frustrating or even painful. Nonetheless it enriches us in ways that simply prompting a machine to generate something for us never will. What’s happening here isn’t about unleashing our imaginations, it’s about outsourcing them. Generative AI strips out part of what makes us human and hands it over to a company so they can sell us a product that claims to do the same thing. In other words the real purpose of these systems isn’t liberation, but profit. Forget the glib marketing slogans about increasing productivity or unleashing our potential. These systems aren’t designed to benefit us as individuals or a society. They’re designed to maximise the ability of tech corporations to extract value by strip-mining the industries they disrupt. This reality is particularly stark in the creative industries. Because the ability of AI systems to magic up stories and images and videos didn’t come out of nowhere. In order to be able to make these things, AIs have to be trained on massive amounts of data. These datasets are generated from publicly available information: books, articles, Wikipedia entries and so on in the case of text; videos and images in the case of visual data. Exactly what these works are is already highly contentious. Some, such as Wikipedia and out-of-copyright books, are in the public domain. But much – and possibly most – of it is not. How could ChatGPT write a song about George Floyd in the style of Bob Dylan without access to Dylan’s songs? The answer is it couldn’t. It could only imitate Dylan because his lyrics formed part of the dataset that was used to train it. Between the secretiveness of these companies and the fact the systems themselves are effectively black boxes, the inner processes of which are opaque even to their creators, it’s difficult to know exactly what has been ingested by any individual AI. What we do know for sure is that vast amounts of copyright material has already been fed into these systems, and is still being fed into them as we speak, all without permission or payment. But AI doesn’t just incrementally erode the rights of authors and other creators. These technologies are designed to replace creative workers altogether. The writer and artist James Bridle has compared this process to the enclosure of the commons, but whichever way you cut it, what we are witnessing isn’t just “systematic theft on a mass scale”, it’s the wilful and deliberate destruction of entire industries and the transfer of their value to shareholders in Silicon Valley. This unconstrained rapaciousness isn’t new. Despite ad campaigns promising care and connection, the tech industry’s entire model depends upon extraction and exploitation. From publishing to transport, tech companies have employed a model that depends upon inserting themselves into traditional industries and “disrupting” them by sidestepping regulation and riding roughshod over hard-won rights or simply fencing off things that were formerly part of the public sphere. In the same way Google hoovered up creative works to make its libraries, filesharing technologies devastated the music industry, and Uber’s model depends on paying its drivers less than taxi companies, AI maximises its profit by refusing to pay the creators of the material it relies on. Meanwhile the human, environmental and social costs of these technologies are kept carefully out of sight. Interestingly the sense of powerlessness and paralysis many of us feel in the face of the social and cultural transformation unleashed by AI resembles our failure to respond to climate change. I don’t think that’s a coincidence. With both there is a profound mismatch between the scale of what is taking place and our capacity to conceptualise it. We find it difficult to imagine fundamental change, and when faced with it, tend to either panic or just shut down. But it’s also because, as with climate change, we have been tricked into thinking there are no alternatives, and that the economic systems we inhabit are natural, and arguing with them makes about as much sense as arguing with the wind. In fact the opposite is true. Companies like Meta and Alphabet and, more recently, OpenAI, have only achieved their extraordinary wealth and power because of very specific regulatory and economic conditions. These arrangements can be altered. That is within the power of government, and we should be insisting upon it. There are currently cases before the courts in a number of jurisdictions that seek to frame the massive expropriation of the work of artists and writers by AI companies as a breach of copyright. The outcome of these cases isn’t yet clear, but even if creators lose, that fight isn’t over. The use of our work to train AIs must be brought under the protection of the copyright system. And we shouldn’t stop there. We should insist upon payment for the work that has been used, payment for all future use and an end to the tech industry practice of taking first and seeking forgiveness later. Their use of copyright material without permission wasn’t accidental. They did it on purpose because they thought they could get away with it. The time has come for them to stop getting away with it. For that to happen we need regulatory structures that ensure transparency about what datasets are being used to train these systems and what is contained in those datasets. And systems of audits to ensure copyright and other forms of intellectual property are not being violated, and that enforce meaningful sanctions if they are. And we need to insist upon international agreements that protect the rights of artists and other creators instead of facilitating the profits of corporations. But most of all, we need to be thinking hard about why what we do as human beings, and as creators and artists in particular, matters. Because it isn’t enough to fret about what is being lost, or to fight a rearguard action against these technologies. We have to begin to articulate positive arguments for the value of what we do, and of creativity more broadly, and to think about what form that might take in a world where AI is a pervasive reality.

                    "bodyText": "Morning everyone.

                    "headline": "How to find genuinely good Black Friday deals: experts share their tips on everything from TVs to skincare",
                    "bodyText": "Whether you’re after a half-price smartphone or a designer coat that won’t break the bank, Black Friday can be excellent for finding that bargain. Retailers want to flog off old stock, attract new customers and maximise sales of seasonal items, so they often drop prices to an irresistible rock bottom. But while there are genuinely sensational deals to be found on and around Black Friday (which falls on 29 November this year), the annual discount jamboree is mined with pitfalls. When a TV is £800 off and “nearly sold out”, you might not stop to read its small print or even check that it can fit in your living room. How should you spot the best deals and avoid throwing good money after bad? We asked experts in travel, tech, toys and more to share their advice. Phones and tablets Smartphones offer some of the biggest Black Friday savings – if you don’t mind settling for last year’s model. “There’s nothing wrong with last year’s phone as long as it was high-end at the time,” says tech journalist Alan Martin. “Phone specs have stagnated, and few people need the latest and greatest models. A 2023 flagship phone won’t be much worse than a 2024 one and can save you a packet. “I wouldn’t recommend buying last year’s budget model, though. Its weaker specs will only get worse over time and it won’t be supported with software updates for as long.” Updates keep a device safe and install the latest features, so it’s essential your phone can receive them. If you’re keen on the AI features being pushed by manufacturers now, make sure your handset is powerful enough to run them. “AI is memory-intensive so some older handsets may be left out in the cold,” says Martin. “The forthcoming iPhone AI, Apple Intelligence, needs 8GB of RAM. That means the only compatible phones from last year’s range are the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.” Mobile contracts “The best Black Friday phone deals tend to be for SIM-free devices,” says Andy Aitken of the mobile network Honest. “With contract deals, there are often strings attached, such as obligatory price hikes, and networks know people shop in a hurry on Black Friday without reading the small print. Also beware of seemingly amazing offers for more data than you need, such as 100GB when you need only 2GB.” And watch out for enticingly cheap contracts that tie you in for years, says Alan Martin. “I’ve seen offers that headline the low monthly cost in the hope that people won’t notice how long they’re locked in for. As a rule of thumb, multiply the monthly cost by the number of months you’re on the hook for. If that figure is significantly less than what you’d pay for a SIM-free phone, it’s a good deal – assuming the bundled data and minutes meet your needs.” It’s becoming increasingly standard to offer contracts for more than two years, so make sure to check before you sign up. Martin also cautions against being dazzled by Black Friday freebie bundles. “I’m still using my Bose QC25s that came with a Huawei phone six years ago, but it’s worth looking up any freebies to find out if they’re reviewed well. If you can’t find any reviews, that’s not a great sign.” Always calculate the cost of the contract to find out how “free” that freebie really is. Skincare Premium serums, supplements and at-home facial tech can get very expensive outside the sales, so Black Friday may be the smartest time to stock up, says beauty expert Justine Masters, AKA the Alternative Facialist. But determine your skincare needs before you whip out your credit card. “Know your skin type,” says Masters. “The deals can be fantastic and the products may be getting plenty of attention on TikTok, but if they’re not right for your skin you’ve wasted your money.” Masters gives her social media followers a heads up on her own deals, so follow your favourite brands to get ahead of the queue. Fashion The leaves may still be clinging to the trees, but shops are already clearing out winter clothes. “Retailers such as New Look and H&amp;M tend to offer seasonal discounts on winter essentials like coats, knitwear and accessories,” says Andrew Norton, centre director of Eden Shopping Centre in High Wycombe. “You’ll typically find the biggest reductions on out-of-season items and wardrobe basics like sweaters and jeans as shops clear stock, so it’s a chance to buy high-quality pieces for less.” Clothes get even cheaper in the January sales, says Norton, but be aware that it will be the stuff other people didn’t want. “Fashion often sees deeper cuts after Christmas, particularly on winter clothing, so January can be a good option if you’re looking for the lowest price. Black Friday is better for specific sizes or popular pieces because there’s more stock available.” Laptops and PCs Black Friday 2023 saw heavy discounts on laptops, with models such as the Dell G15 gaming laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra shedding almost half their price before bouncing back up on the stroke of December. But they’re still expensive, so shop carefully to avoid a false economy. “A new PC or laptop has to come with Windows 11 pre-installed,” says computing journalist Dominic Connor. “And go long on memory. Look for at least 16GB of RAM if you’re not technical enough to upgrade it later.” Other features can be dispensed with to save money. “Really cheap PCs may not have Bluetooth, but you can fix that with a £10 dongle. And don’t pay much more for the ‘right’ video port, because cheap adapters are available online.” Refurbished PCs fall to well under £200 on Black Friday, but they bring their own challenges. “Refurbished tech devices may not be able to run the latest software,” warns Josh Long, chief security analyst at Intego. “You’ll miss out on security updates and that can put you at risk. Make sure to check how many years of updates any device will get before buying.” TVs As with phones, the best TV deals tend to be for old models – and Connor is fine with that. “My family and I have been buying ‘last year’s TV’ since the 1980s. The trick is to buy last year’s, not last generation’s. Last year will be slightly less fancy; last generation won’t be OLED and may be just bog standard LED.” It’s worth knowing the difference. Black Friday can be a chance for brands to off-load their low-quality TVs on unsuspecting bargain hunters. “Something I see in a lot of cheap TVs is if a single backlight LED fails, it takes out the entire TV,” says tech journalist Andrew Spode. “This seems to be common in TVs that use cheaper parts and don’t have great quality control. The other discount trick I’ve seen is suspiciously large TVs going cheap, but they’re only 30Hz so not suitable for gaming.” A TV with a 30Hz refresh rate is fine for watching films on an average-sized screen, but on an enormous screen, it will look juddery. “Many of the low to mid-range smart TVs in the sales have taken ideas from the ‘fast fashion’ playbook and only offer low-quality audio options,” says digital rights expert Lauren Hendry Parsons of ExpressVPN. You could make up the audio slack by looking for Black Friday TV bundles with free soundbars. “These may not be the latest or most hi-tech models, but often they’re perfectly serviceable and improve your viewing experience,” says Hendry Parsons. “If a freebie tips the scales for an otherwise like-for-like deal, there’s no reason to not consider it.” Spotting a good deal is easier if you’ve done your research. Samsung’s Jeremy Demont recommends reading reviews and knowing what you want to buy before Black Friday. “Know what TV model, size and image quality you’re looking for, so you can recognise a genuinely good deal. Also look for added value such as free delivery, finance options and discounted compatible components.” Toys and games “Toys like Lego sets tend to have good price drops for all the ‘shopping holidays’ like Prime Day and Black Friday,” says Daniel Green, founder of Amazon price-tracker CamelCamelCamel. “Prices at Amazon are changing all the time, so it’s wise to track them to ensure you aren’t buying when they are high. This becomes much more important during peak shopping season.” Different types of toys are better buys on Black Friday and in the January sales, says Eden Shopping Centre’s Andrew Norton. “Trending items or those with high restocking rates tend to get the best discounts around now, and we see big savings on larger items retailers want to move before Christmas. January sales may offer further discounts on classic toys or less time-sensitive items.” Washing machines and dishwashers Appliances aren’t traditional Black Friday superstars, instead reaching their lowest prices in summer. There will be bargains around, says Fergus Johnston of Hotpoint, but shop carefully and make energy efficiency a priority. “Always check the energy label. Higher-rated appliances may cost more upfront but they use less energy and can make a significant difference to your household running costs. Also, look for a retailer with a wide supply of spare parts and good warranty terms.” Sustainability still matters in the sales, says Johnston. “The environmental impact of Black Friday has become a talking point in recent years. It’s important to choose a business that holds up its responsibilities.” Air fryers and coffee machines These twin titans of the 21st-century kitchen are huge sellers in the run-up to Christmas, so you might not expect them to be discounted. Isabella Forgione, small appliances expert at AO.com, has news for you. “These items are perfect for gifting, so we see a greater demand at this time of year and they have some of our biggest discounts.” Indeed, Black Friday 2023 saw bestsellers, including the Tower Xpress air fryer and the Nespresso Barista coffee machine reach historically low prices with various retailers. Furniture As eager as you may be to replace the wobbly dining table or saggy guest mattress before the masses descend at Christmas, don’t expect to make big Black Friday savings. “Retailers reserve their biggest furniture discounts for the new year to make way for new products,” says Nick Drewe of discount platform Wethrift. “Home fitness equipment also tends to be cheaper in January, because retailers and gyms run promotions to capitalise on post-Christmas goals.” Home office furniture is a different story. Many of Amazon’s bestselling office chairs and desks dip to their lowest prices in Black Friday week. However, Mike Moore of TechRadar Pro cautions against being swayed by heavy discounts. “An office chair is something you’re going to be using for long stretches of time.” Buying online also means you can’t try out the chair. “You should be able to have both feet on the floor and your elbows at a 90- to 110-degree angle. At least do some measuring before you shop.” Travel and luggage Holiday packages, hotels and flights see price drops on Black Friday, but you’ll need to keep an open mind about timings. “The best deals tend to be for midweek bookings and on packages that would normally be among the cheapest anyway,” says Carolyn Pearson, founder of women’s business travel network Maiden Voyage. “Weekends and school holidays are always in demand so they’re rarely discounted, even on Black Friday.” Packing essentials offer richer pickings, says Pearson. “I get all my summer wellness essentials in the Black Friday sales. I stock up on pillow sprays, eye masks and magnesium supplements, which all really help me sleep when I’m away. Lookfantastic’s Waitlist newsletter is good for discount codes and early deals.”"

This is what made the news: Striking nurses have rejected an offer to fund their requested pay rise in return for delaying the rollout of their “big ask” for more staff, NSW’s health minister says, with emergency wait times expected to get longer. Girls are now seeing porn for the first time at 13.6 years, on average – two years younger than they were in 2018. The Australian federal police raided multiple locations in Melbourne’s western suburbs last night as part of an investigation into alleged fraud against the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Tabcorp was fined over $260,000 for accepting bets on live tennis. The Greens announced a $100m per year plan to ensure public hospitals can provide abortion services. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers announced funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Peter Dutton says he supports the right of women to access legal abortion but will not require the Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and the South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic to withdraw a sponsored bill to change abortion law. Australia’s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, recorded a quarterly $2.5bn cash net profit backed by “strong momentum” in home lending. A senior Trump adviser has posted a gif of an hourglass in response to Kevin Rudd’s congratulation message to the incoming president, but former prime minister Tony Abbott, defended Rudd. The Catholic church won a landmark case limiting its liability for the abuse of children by priests not under its direct employment. The wage price index for the September quarter has come in at 3.5% compared with a year earlier, the ABS reported. That figure compared with the 3.6% pace expected by economists and the 4.1% clip reported by the ABS for the June quarter. Independent senator David Pocock says he will be opposing the government’s misinformation and disinformation bill “unless major changes are made to the legislation”. Sydney trains will run 24 hours for the next three days amid an industrial dispute. Nacc releases fact sheet to dispel misinformation Earlier today, the National Anti-Corruption Commission put out its “corrections to misinformation” factsheet. In its weekly update, the federal integrity body said a “significant amount of misinformation” circulates about the Nacc. While it could not “correct everything”, it wanted to address some of the primary issues it had by countering it with “facts and evidence”. Interestingly, one of the points related to a recent finding about the Nacc commissioner, Paul Brereton. The Nacc inspector, the watchdog’s watchdog, found his involvement in a decision not to start a corruption investigation into robodebt referrals resulted in the process being “affected by apprehended bias”. Read more: The Nacc says media references saying Brereton submitted a conflict of interest declaration because one of the persons referred to the Nacc was a ‘close personal friend’ are misinformation. The Nacc helpfully supplied this correction: The commissioner declared immediately and repeatedly that he had a perceived (not actual) conflict of interest, arising from a prior professional, not personal, relationship with one of the referred persons. The commissioner and that individual have never socialised other than at official functions, nor visited each other’s homes. So, what did the inspector’s report say? In its executive summary, it referenced Brereton’s own words about “person one”. That included that Brereton said he had a “close association” with person one, that they were someone he “knows well”, and “who is well known to me”. The language changed when the Nacc provided a submission to the inspector in August 2024. Brereton said his relationship with person one was a “prior professional association, and not a close personal relationship”. In a report prepared by Alan Robertson SC, the former federal court judge said the change in the Nacc’s language was “gloss” and the conflict existed in “the terms it was disclosed”. Round-the-clock Sydney train services explained If you’re confused as to why Sydney trains is running 24 hours for the next three days, AAP reports it was one of the demands of the union. The union wants a 32 % pay rise over four years and a 35-hour working week and has accused the government of “dragging its heels” on an improved offer. But RTBU NSW secretary Toby Warnes said commuters should not pay the price for that and would instead benefit from the “novel” industrial action. Our protected industrial action is always about causing a headache for the government, so they actually listen to the needs of their workforce; it’s never about disrupting the travelling public. Our call for 24-hour transport has the benefit of being a pain for management and the government, while also resulting in improved services for commuters. Previous industrial action was avoided when the government agreed to a union demand to have 50c fares for a weekend. Planned industrial action on light rail services, which will see limited services run on Friday and Saturday, are still set to continue. Pandas bid farewell to Australia Wang Wang and Fu Ni’s love affair with Australia has ended with a final farewell to visitors at Adelaide zoo, AAP reports. As a final treat, the pair – on loan from China since 2009 – were given a special meal on Wednesday enriched with letters, messages and drawings from more than 1000 adoring fans. Zoo keepers provided an emotional farewell to the animals in a video on social media. Senior primate keeper Pij Olijnik said he loved greeting the pandas each morning. I just love rocking up to work and opening the door and having pandas there that greet you. They verbally greet you and seem happy to see you and welcome you into that environment. There were long-held hopes that Wang Wang, 19, and Fu Ni, 18, would breed while in Australia, as part of a global conservation program for the vulnerable species. But despite many attempts during their brief annual mating window, several “false pregnancies”, and failed artificial insemination procedures for Fu Ni, parenthood remained out of reach for the popular pair. Adelaide Zoo will welcome new giant pandas, male Xing Qiu (pronounced shing chee-y-ull) and female Yi Lan (ee-lun), later this year. Both are from the Chinese city of Chengdu and are aged three, with Xing Qiu turning four just before his arrival. The Bureau of Metereology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Queensland. Richard Marles congratulates Trump’s pick for defense secretary The defence minister and deputy prime minister has congratulated Fox News host, Pete Hegseth for being picked by Donald Trump to be defense secretary in the incoming Trump administration. Marles told the ABC that he had not met Hegseth but extended his congratulations: Representing the United States government as the secretary of defense is a huge responsibility. And this will be an amazing opportunity for Pete Hegseth and certainly from my point of view, I worked more closely with my American counterpart, Lloyd Austin then I would have with any other defence minister around the world. I’m sure that will be the case when Pete Hegseth becomes the secretary of defense. It is a critically important part of the way in which our bilateral relationship exists, so much of what happens between our two companies happens through the prism of defence. I very much look forward to meeting him in building a relationship which will help us take the alliance into the future. On the future for US ambassador Kevin Rudd, Marles said Rudd had attended the Republican National Convention earlier this year, and had been important to introducing the government to a number of figures who may play a part in a future Trump administration. He said Rudd will build the best relationship Australia can with the future Trump administration. The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, has said rail services in suburban parts of the Sydney train network will need to run for 24 hours a day during planned industrial action from Thursday to Saturday otherwise “there will be no services at all” due to some of the work bans being put in place by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union. She said: We want confidence and certainty for passengers and for the transport workforce, we have made very good progress across some 28 bargaining meetings, all day long, meetings now for over six months. In fact, the bargaining room is in operation today. I feel we are close to a resolution, but we need to round this out by Christmas. The commitment of the government Sydney trains, New South Wales trains, and I understand the unions, is to resolve this as quickly as possible, but we also want passengers to be able to get where they need to go. Haylen said there could be major delays, but the current plan was for a normal timetable to run across Sydney on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and in the evening and in particular between midnight and 4am when there wouldn’t normally be operating trains, there will be a train every 30 minutes. Matt Longland, chief executive of Sydney trains said track work planned over the weekend had been cancelled, and urged customers to plan ahead in order to not be too put out by delays. The period that we’re entering into is one in which a number of new bans will take place from tomorrow … will make it increasingly difficult to operate a reliable network. Safety is always our number one priority, and none of our team will operate services where it’s not safe to do so, but we do expect that there will be some delays. Another TV news executive has resigned suddenly from Nine Entertainment. The resignation leaves the Sydney and the Brisbane TV newsrooms of Nine News without a leader. “Nine can confirm further leadership changes were communicated to its TV News division today,” a spokesperson for Nine said. “An internal and external recruitment process is now under way for news directors in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.” The Perth news director position is vacant because of the internal promotion of Gareth Parker. Brisbane news director Amanda Paterson left Nine a week ago after a 31-year career in TV news and current affairs including a stint as a reporter on A Current Affair. On Wednesday staff were told the Sydney news director, Simon Hobbs, will leave the business on Friday. Here’s the video of shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, speaking on whether US ambassador, Kevin Rudd, should stay in the job after Donald Trump’s election victory last week in the US. Police called in over allegations of vote tampering in Victorian council elections The Victorian Electoral Commission has referred allegations of suspected postal vote tampering in two Melbourne council elections to police. The VEC on Wednesday afternoon said it had detected a high number of multiple returned votes in Knox city council, in Melbourne’s east, and Whittlesea city council – which was overseen by administrators between 2020 and 2024 after governance issues, in Melbourne’s north, after voting closed in the state’s council elections last month. Both elections have been declared by the VEC and on Wednesday it requested the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Vcat) review the results in Whittlesea’s Lalor ward and Knox’s Baird ward. Peter Lockwood won Baird ward on a margin of 1.87% while Stevan Kozmevski secured a victory in Lalor on a 0.16% margin. There is no suggestions of wrongdoing by either candidate. Asio using AI in data processing The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) has revealed it has been using artificial intelligence to process vast amounts of counter-terrorism data since April this year. In its 2024 annual report, released at the end of October, the spy agency said it had deployed AI “in support of a high-priority counter-terrorism investigation” to triage terabytes of data and “identify the intelligence-needle in a field of digital-haystacks.” Asio said: The AI capabilities efficiently prioritised security-relevant information within hours, enabling Asio officers to go straight to the most security-relevant product that would otherwise take hundreds of hours to find. The agency said an Asio officer reviews all results, and a human is responsible and accountable for Asio’s decision-making, but the use of AI significantly reduced the time between the collection and analysis of intelligence. Treasurer says ‘direction of travel is pretty clear’ in uptake of renewable energy Jim Chalmers also talked about the “Great Fragmentation” that has unwound over the past fifteen years or so since the global financial crisis (followed by the Covid pandemic and global inflation spike after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine). We couldn’t help wondering whether the incoming/returning Trump administration would create a particularly big fragmentation of global climate policy given Trump’s promise to pull the US out of the Paris Climate agreement for a second time, and his “drill, baby, drill” mantra that echoes in parts of Australia too. Chalmers said the change of administration “does introduce another element of uncertainty in the global net zero transformation. That said, “the weight of the world’s direction, more broadly … encourages us and convinces us that we’re on the right track”, Chalmers said. “No one, I think, can really argue against the role that cheaper and cleaner energy will play in our own industrial and economic development, or indeed, more broadly,” he said, adding that “the direction of travel is pretty clear in the world [and] in the global economy”. Overall, this will be the defining change and challenge in our economy over a longer time frame than governments in either country. Physics, it should be said, also don’t pay heed to electoral cycles – even though that might get lost in the coming political campaign. Guess we’ll find out soon enough on this matter too. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been giving a speech to economists in Sydney this afternoon in the wake of some generally positive wages data from the September quarter. (See earlier posts here and our article here.) Guardian Australia managed to squeeze a couple of late questions in, including about how tough a message was it to convince Australians that a recovery in real wages would help households (when a similar message by incumbent US Democrats failed to cut through) Chalmers, after all, had just shown this chart to the audience, and the red bits are some ways off making up for the black bits (which began prior to the Albanese government taking office in May 2022. Chalmers said the September quarter numbers were “a great outcome”, and the four quarters in a row of gains in real terms “very, very encouraging”. Real wages growth is one of the things I focus most on. I read a lot of stuff over a period of time that said you couldn’t have strong wages growth and have inflation moderating. We’ve shown that’s possible. We’ve shown it’s happening. “There is not a whiff of a wage-price spiral in our economy, and that’s a good thing,” he said, adding that “we’ve got a lot of ground to make up”. Guess we’ll learn soon enough whether the electorate thinks the current government is more likely to deliver on-going real wage growth – or the coalition. Nurses reject pay offer Striking nurses have rejected an offer to fund their requested pay rise in return for delaying the rollout of their “big ask” for more staff, NSW’s health minister says. AAP reports, hundreds of surgeries are expected to be postponed as more than 50,000 nurses and midwives campaign for better pay. The 24-hour strike across NSW public hospitals began at 7.30am on Wednesday, with nurses and midwives calling for a one-off pay bump of 15% after large wage increases for teachers, paramedics and, most recently, police officers. The strike is estimated to force the postponement of 600 to 700 surgeries, according to NSW Health. Emergency department wait times are also expected to blow out and people with non-life threatening conditions are urged to contact Healthdirect before arriving at hospitals. Minimal, life-preserving staffing will be maintained in all public hospitals and health services during the 24-hour strike. The health minister, Ryan Park, said he was disappointed the union walked away from its commitment to negotiate before the Industrial Relations Commission: We honoured our end of the bargain … there was an expectation, though, that this industrial action was not going to take place. The government delivered the union’s “big ask” to begin the rollout of staffing ratios despite the billion-dollar cost, but the sought pay rise was not possible to implement in a single year, Park said. The union rejected an offer for the 15% increase to be provided over multiple years and for a slightly larger boost for early career nurses, the health minister said. But the union said the government had not entered negotiations willing to use extra money to fund pay increases. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Josh Taylor will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. The Bureau of Meteorology has provided an updated severe thunderstorm warning for eastern NSW. It said severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding over the next several hours – affecting Grafton, Batemans Bay, Tenterfield, Moree, Parkes and Maclean. 3cm large hailstones were recorded at Parkes around 1pm, it said, while 24.4mm of rain was recorded at Jerangle in the 30 minutes to 12:16pm. Steggall says Labor and Coalition must disclose what 2035 target they will each take to next election At Cop29, UK prime minister Keir Starmer will pledge to cut emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035, a target in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee. Independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, welcomed the move in a statement, and said: The world is on track for 3.1 degrees of warming if nations do not increase their commitments to reduce emissions. The Albanese government and the Coalition must come clean with the Australian public and announce what 2035 target they will take to the next election. Australians deserve to know whether they are fair dinkum about acting on climate risk or pandering to the fossil fuel industry. The Australian Fashion Council (AFC) has responded to news that IMG will abandon Australian Fashion Week after nearly 20 years, leaving its future uncertain. IMG made the announcement after owning and operating AFW since 2005. The AFC said the event provided “a critical platform for Australian designers to showcase their talent and innovation, and [positioned] Australia as a key player on the global fashion stage.” AFC chair Marianne Perkovic and CEO Jaana Quaintance-James issued a joint statement on the decision, and said: [AFC] has learnt today of IMG’s decision to not proceed with Australian Fashion Week (AFW) in 2025 … Turning to the future, we know we need a platform to profile and celebrate Australian fashion. This moment signals an opportunity for the industry to reimagine and reshape how Australian fashion is represented, and provides us all with an opportunity to explore new ways in which to showcase emerging and established Australian talent. The AFC, as the peak body for fashion and textiles in Australia, will lead this conversation. We will work with members, government and other stakeholders to consider the future platform needed to position and elevate Australian fashion internationally. Master Builders welcomes new national productivity fund to boost productivity Master Builders Australia says it strongly supports the announcement by treasurer Jim Chalmers today of a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Paul Karp had all the details on this earlier in the blog, here. In a statement, Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn said the advocacy group had consistently called for incentives to support reform and lift productivity in the building and construction industry – with labour productivity down 18% over the last decade. Productivity is more than a buzzword. When productivity is down, prices go up and our ability to build the homes and surrounding infrastructure communities need is slowed down. We thank the treasurer for putting productivity back on the national agenda and listening to our concerns around barriers to building. Master Builders analysis of build times found that 15 years ago, it took on average 9 months to build a stand-a-alone house from approval to completion, while today it now takes 12.7 months – an increase of over 40%. There are currently three severe weather warnings in place for NSW, Queensland and Victoria. The Bureau of Meteorology has alerted: Severe thunderstorms are likely to cause heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding over the next several hours in parts of the NSW south coast, southern tablelands and Snowy Mountains regions. In Queensland, scattered thunderstorms are set to develop along the seat, with severe thunderstorms expected over the south-east into the afternoon and evening. This is likely to produce large hailstones, damaging winds and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding. And in Victoria, severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall and could lead to flash flooding around Buchan, Gelantipy and Bonang. Meanwhile, the NSW SES has issued a “monitor conditions” alert for Parkes and Peak Hill amid the forecast heavy rain, damaging winds and large hailstones. Brumbies cull wins approval in NSW, but rift remains A multi-party report backing the counting and shooting of feral horses in national parks should put to bed “ridiculous anti-science questioning” from critics, environmental advocates say. As AAP reports, the NSW parliamentary inquiry report has found the state was using global best-practice methods to count brumbies and there was no clear evidence of any animal-welfare breaches under current culling methods. At least 5,800 – or an estimated one in three – brumbies have been killed in NSW since aerial shooting resumed in November 2023. Ecologists estimate about that number will need to be culled annually to reach a 3000-horse cap by 2027 due to high birthrates. The inquiry broadly dismissed concerns about distance sampling being used to measure the population annually, although it welcomed the trial of new methods in the most recent count. The Invasive Species Council advocacy director, Jack Gough, said strong cross-party support from Liberals to the Greens and independents for effective brumby control reflected public backing for native wildlife to be protected from feral horses: This report should once and for all end the ridiculous anti-science questioning of the feral horse count figures by a small minority that do not want to see a single feral horse removed from the national park. Committee chair and Animal Justice MP Emma Hurst hit out at the Labor, Liberal and Shooters-backed report, saying the findings and recommendations did not reflect her views. Along with Nationals MLC Wes Fang, Hurst backed a finding that aerial shooting of brumbies could not be ethically justified. The federal government will make an announcement on university funding in the coming weeks, the education minister has flagged, cementing student debt as a key election issue. Speaking to a TEQSA conference in Melbourne on Wednesday, Jason Clare reiterated that, if Labor won next year’s election, the first piece of legislation it would introduce would be to cut student debts by 20%. But he said there was “more to do” to make the system fairer. When Hecs was first created students paid an average of about 24% of the cost of degree. This increased to about 36% in the late 1990s. And now, because of the changes the previous government made, it’s about 45%. Cutting student debt by 20% fixes that for a generation of Australians. But there is more to do. That includes changing the way we fund universities. Part of that is uncapping the number of places at university for students from disadvantaged backgrounds … part of that is a new needs-based funding system … and part of that is a new Australian Tertiary Education Commission (ATEC) … to drive reform over the long term. And I hope to provide you with more detail on all of that before the end of the year. Clare has previously stated ATEC would be tasked with scrapping the Coalition’s Job Ready Graduates Scheme, which has driven arts degrees above $50,000. Birmingham says Israeli settlements in Gaza ‘should not be undertaken’ Simon Birmingham was asked about comments from members of the Netanyahu government, advocating the establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza. He responded that “Australian governments, Coalition and Labor, have long been clear that settlement activity that is counter-productive to achieving longstanding settlement of issues should not be undertaken”. That position has not changed and shouldn’t change. He also said the Coalition has “no plans” to change Australian laws in regard to supplying weapons or ammunition to Israel. But if the Israeli government was to ask for help? He responded: The structure is indeed as to how those defence export laws operate and, you know, that is the consistency that we would apply. And with that, Birmingham’s appearance at the National Press Club has wrapped up. Birmingham says decision on further tax cuts yet to be made Simon Birmingham was asked about comments from Peter Dutton on the radio this morning that the Coalition was rethinking stage-three tax cuts and getting inflation under control was more important. What is the Coalition’s stance? He criticised the Albanese government for breaking an election promise and added: We accepted at the time we were not going to stand in the way of Australians receiving those funds. Spend the money, they have, and I think what Peter was rightly alluding to this morning is, as it comes into the next campaign, we will have to have a look, carefully, at the state of the books as we make those final budget decisions, and where we can go in terms of further tax cuts will be one of those big key points in terms of those final budget decisions. Asked if he is underestimating how difficult and challenging the next four years under Trump may be, Simon Birmingham said he is optimistic about working with the administration and hopes to make success of it. And yes, there are disrupters like president [Donald] Trump who is clearly bringing in to disrupt things like government efficiency in the US government through the role that he has given to Elon Musk. I wouldn’t mind having a bit of disruption of efficiency in the Australian government at times either. I’m not saying it will be the right pathway, but who knows? Maybe there will be glimmers of lessons that could be learned along the way. Birmingham says Coalition ‘clear in principles’ on Israel-Gaza war despite civilian death toll Our own Sarah Basford Canales has asked Simon Birmingham a series of questions on the Coalition’s response to the conflict in Gaza: Is there a red line for the opposition in terms of that death toll continuing to rise by the thousands in the coming months and potentially years? Does the opposition still think this is the best way to peace and a two-state solution in the situation? And what would a Dutton government do differently if it were to be elected next election? Birmingham answered the last question first and said the Coalition’s view is that any prospect of a two-state solution should be “fully negotiated, and negotiated by settling questions of borders, of security guarantees and rights of return, but also that we should be engaging in what other regional processes and pathways might be possible”. He said the Coalition is “resolute in terms of our position around Israel’s right to self-defence”. We equally want to see the tragic loss of life come to an end and for a breakthrough point. But you can see by statements out of Qatar just in the last week the frustration that exists in relation to Hamas’ unwillingness to release hostages, to lay down arms and to stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields in this conflict. Is the civilian death toll a consideration that might affect the Coalition’s resoluteness on that position? Birmingham replied: The civilian death toll is something that pains absolutely all of us and, of course, it is a tragedy in any and all conflict and a very significant tragedy in this one, but we’re clear in terms of the principles we stand by and the outcomes we ultimately seek. Birmingham says Coalition aiming to deter invasion of Taiwan and be ‘principled and predictable with China’ One reporter asked if the Coalition is elected at the next election and faces a “horror scenario” of an invasion of Taiwan, would it move to defend Taiwan if attacked by China? Simon Birmingham responded that “you’re taking us forward quite a few steps in that regard”, but added: Principled and predictable is the framework that I’ve outlined for how our engagement with China should be and should operate … [and] part of that is that we would not wish to see any unilateral change to Taiwan and its circumstances and not wish to see an invasion of the sort that you’ve characterised. And clearly it … should be entirely predictable to Beijing that Australia would condemn such action, oppose such action and, indeed, do everything we can to deter such action from occurring in the first place. Birmingham said that if an invasion occurred “what the nature of conflict is, what role the US or others undertake, are all unknowns before we get to the question of how Australia would respond”. Our prime job is to deter it in the first place and to work with our partners to try to deter that from happening in the first place. Birmingham says he has tried to keep an open mind over whether Kevin Rudd stays as ambassador Q: If the president-elect in the last year has referred to our ambassador in the US as “not the brightest bulb”, is it really tenable for that person to be at the forefront of our engagement in Washington? Simon Birmingham responded: The president-elect has just named a secretary of state who had some pretty sharp things to say about him, but who ultimately campaigned alongside him. He’s been elected alongside a vice-president who had very sharp and pointed things to say about him, but who he chose to make his running mate. So I think we’ve got to be conscious of keeping an open mind, which is what we have tried to do in relation to the question around Kevin. Birmingham says Coalition does not want to politicise Kevin Rudd’s role Simon Birmingham was asked to respond to the tweet from senior Trump adviser Dan Scavino overnight, suggesting time was running out for Kevin Rudd’s tenure as ambassador. You can read more on this earlier in the blog, here. Birmingham was asked for the Coalition’s position on Rudd’s tenure, and whether he should stand aside amid his now-deleted commentary on Trump? He responded that “what we have here is a need for Australia not to be debating the who, but the what, and the outcomes and the effectiveness of getting those outcomes”. Peter Dutton and I have been very clear that we have wanted to see Kevin Rudd succeed all along. We have acknowledged and praised some of his successes, acknowledged his work in getting the export trade restrictions eased between Australia and the US and big Aukus breakthroughs that have been really important in that regard. And we want to see that success continue and that’s what matters in Australia’s national interest. Now, ambassador Rudd and the prime minister are the ones who are in the box seat to best make the assessment in coming weeks or months about how effectively he is going to be able to continue to have the influence and get the outcomes that Australia needs. Birmingham said the Coalition was not seeking to politicise the role. In terms of the tweet from Scavino specifically, he said: A significant member of the incoming president’s campaign team posted that. What we are to make of the image, well, I think I’ll leave it for others to comment on the image. I’ve spoken to the substance. Birmingham says climate ambition must not end in broken promises On the climate, Simon Birmingham sought to reinforce that the upcoming election would be about how Australia gets to net zero – not if. That that is a really important message to drive home to those Pacific nations, that the construct of debate in this country is focused on actually achieving that … That’s how we need to really make sure we take a careful and thoughtful approach to framing that election contest. Speaking about Paris agreements, Birmingham said “being upfront about what is achievable in the time horizons that are there” is important. It is no more helpful – in fact, arguably it’s more counter-productive – to be in a situation where targets are made but not realised and you’ve broken your promise to nations, than it is to have been realistic in the first place. And of course we want to stretch to maximum ambition, and I’ve been clear about my desire to see maximum ambition at all times, but it’s not going to go down well if maximum ambition simply translates into broken promises. Birmingham says Australia still ‘a few steps away’ from being interlocutor between US and China Back at the National Press Club, Simon Birmingham has been taking questions from reporters. He was asked about comments from the prime minister today that Australia is a trusted middle power that could help manage the strategic competition between the US and China. Does he agree with this, or is it a naive view and great powers will just do what great powers do? Birmingham replied that “Australia should always seek to play as constructive a role as we possibly can”: But I think at this point of change and contest we also need to be realistic about the challenges that we face. He said when it comes to the Trump administration in the US there are immediate priorities to address, including Aukus and tariffs. Beyond those bilateral points of engagement, there will be ways in which we want to seek to encourage the US as to how they engage in our region. Active engagement remains critical and important across particularly the Asean nations, and no doubt there will be times for discussion about the nature of their engagement with China and the implications of that with other nations and on the global economy. But are we going to step up and be able to fulfil some situation that is foreseeable as a significant interlocutor between the two? I think we’re a few steps away from that at this point in time. Tasmanian independent labels funding for Maugean skate as ‘self-serving handout’ Breaking away from the National Press Club: independent MP Andrew Wilkie has labelled government funding aimed at saving the endangered Maugean skate as an “expensive and self-serving handout”. Yesterday, Anthony Albanese announced a $28m boost for new measures in Macquarie harbour, including scaling up oxygenation to offset the effects of human activities on the Maugean skate. During his second press conference of the day, protesters were heard chanting various slogans including what sounded like “save the Maugean skate”. In a post to X today, Wilkie – the federal member for Clark in Tasmania – said: $28m to Macquarie harbour is just an expensive and self-serving handout to try and win Braddon, while at the same time kowtowing to Labor’s mates in the salmon industry. Again, the loser is the imperilled Maugean skate. Simon Birmingham argued that the United Nations is “failing to meet its charter to maintain international peace and security”. With the UN paralysed, effective peace-keeping initiatives no longer enjoy international momentum. To avoid a repeat of the world wars of last century, deterrence and diplomacy must be more effective today than appeasement was then. Birmingham says its more important than ever China act with ‘great responsibility’ On China, Simon Birmingham said Australia’s approach should be “both principled and predictable”. Ideally, China would respect international rulings on maritime boundaries and its forces would not engage in acts of aggression or actions that risk miscalculation. Ideally, China would use its influence and relations with countries like Russia, Iran and North Korea to stem the rise in conflict, not enable it. Ideally, China’s systems would operate with integrity and transparency, whether in matters of cyber security, or market competitiveness. Australia’s position on issues like these should be of no surprise. As China continues its growth, including the rapid growth of its nuclear armed military capabilities, it becomes more important than ever that this great power act with great responsibility. Birmingham welcomed China’s decision to restore ministerial level dialogue with Australia and said it was “counterproductive of them to have chosen to cease it in the first place.” He said this dialogue should continue, but later noted “such ambitions for cooperation may be thwarted if the current trajectory of global conflict continues.” Birmingham said no reason to ‘catastrophise’ over second Trump presidency Moving to a second Donald Trump presidency, Simon Birmingham labelled him a “disrupter” who is “prone to pursuing less conventional policies and making bolder pronouncements” – but said this is not a reason to “catastrophise”. The Turnbull and Morrison governments demonstrated how to work with a Trump administration. There are opportunities in the second Trump administration. He said Aukus must play a key role into the future, and for the case to be made to Trump as follows: No other US ally in this region is investing to expand their defence capability like Australia is. No other US ally is investing directly in US defence industrial capabilities like Australia is. And no other US ally is investing to build defence industrial capabilities that complement those of the US like Australia is … Prime Minister [Anthony] Albanese should be making [these] points to President Trump in person, at the earliest opportunity. Birmingham wants formal trilateral cooperation between India, Indonesia and Australia Simon Birmingham says the contest for influence in the Pacific is symbolic of a greater global contest, and that the world we live in today “is profoundly different from the established order that I, or most of us, grew up with”. He said trilateral cooperation between India, Indonesia and Australia should be sought “to secure the open maritime domain that we all rely upon, the security we desire, and the growth we all seek”. The significant roles India, Indonesia and Australia play within our region, coupled with our different alliances and partnerships, can aid our ability to navigate and shape the contested world we face. Such a minilateral partnership can complement our work in the Quad, and other partnerships, especially our relations across our fellow Asean nations. Simon Birmingham addresses National Press Club The shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra today, about preserving Australia’s interests in a contested world. He has been outlining work done by previous leaders throughout the decades to secure Australia’s standing, and said that “nowhere is the creation of a partisan distinction in foreign policy … more counterproductive than the Pacific”. Birmingham said the contest for Pacific influence and engagement was “entrenched”: China’s model of elite capture and less regulated funding is enticing to some. In contrast, Australia’s ethical, values-based approach is better policy but harder politics. To advance our interests, we must be at one in promoting the bipartisanship of Australia’s investment in – and respect for – Pacific Island nations, their sovereignty and their people. He said the singular message of Australian leaders to Pacific leaders “must be one of enduring and reliable partnership, above all politics”. Chrisian and Muslim faith leaders in Queensland say they have “profound concerns” about the new LNP government’s call to abolish the state’s First Nations Truth-telling and Healing Inquiry. A statement from 13 religious leaders – including from the Catholic and Anglican churches, and the Council of Imams – acknowledges that faith-based organisations “are historically complicit” in the suffering of First Nations people “including in the way that churches have collaborated with the state”. The premier, David Crisafulli, had promised before the state election to end the inquiry. The new government has since directed it to end its hearings, including sessions planned in remote communities in the coming weeks. The church leaders’ statement says the inquiry would be vital for listening and recording stories and “collating evidence to shine a light on our past”. Before abolishing this independent inquiry, we believe the new state government needs to clarify to all Queenslanders what will be implemented in its place … noting the advanced age and physical frailty of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inquiry contributors. How all Queenslanders will be able to heal and move forward together – with dignity and respect – and understand our shared history in all its challenges and richness. In the midst of the tragic impacts of displacement, dispossession, the forcible removal of children and policies of assimilation … there are also stories of appreciation, reconciliation and triumph in adversity. All these stories need to continue to be heard. We believe Queensland remains ready to hear the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and that in the sharing of stories that a more compassionate and resilient Queensland will emerge. Public schools will ‘never reach’ full funding under proposed forms, senate inquiry hears Public schools will “never reach” full funding under the federal government’s proposed reforms, a senate inquiry has heard. Labor’s bill allows the commonwealth to provide extra funding to public schools in excess of 20%, making the figure a floor, not a ceiling. States and territories front 75%, leaving a 5% gap. All jurisdictions except Victoria, NSW and Queensland have agreed to Labor’s proposal to bring its contribution 2.5% above the floor to 22.5%, leaving the remaining 2.5% gap to be filled by the states by 2029. But peak bodies including Save Our Schools, the Isolated Children’s Parents’ Association and the Australian Secondary Principals’ Association told the enquiry the federal government should lift its funding floor to 25% and remove “accounting tricks” in the bill. National Convenor of Save Our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said even with a 5% increase in funding public schools wouldn’t reach the dream of Gonski, citing a 4% loophole retained in the agreement which allows jurisdictions to claim funding on non-school expenditures like capital depreciation. 18 years after Gonski public schools still won’t be funded according to need. It’s a devastating outcome. President of the Australian Secondary Principals’ Association, Andy Mison said the body was also concerned about the 4%, arguing schools would “never reach” 100% funding if it were retained. I think it’s appalling. Public schools … bear the brunt of social inequities and are increasingly being asked to do more with less … the concentration of disadvantage is increasing. We urge greater ambition ... I don’t think it passes the pub test to include capital depreciation More on the wages figures As always, some industries reported higher wage increases than others. Perhaps surprisingly, the highest quarterly increase was 2.5% for those in accommodation and food services – a sector that might be considered “discretionary”. Financial and insurance services posted a 0.5% quarterly rise, or the least of all industries. At an annual rate, those in electricity, gas and water posted the largest increase at 5%, while (sadly for some close to this blog) arts and recreation lagged other industries with a 2.9% rise. And, as for the different regions of this great browned-off land, Queensland posted the largest quarterly wage rise at 1.6% (though it seemed to do the Labour government there no favours). The ACT, with all its public servants, managed a 1% rise – or the least among the jurisdictions. For annual increases, Tassie was the place to be, with wages up 4%. At the other end of the country, the Northern Territory posted the smallest annual rises at 3%. We’ll return to the workers’ tale roughly this time tomorrow, when we get October labour market numbers. CBA reckons the economy added 20,000 jobs last month, or not quite enough to stop the jobless rate ticking higher to 4.2% (from 4.1% in September). Watch out for those numbers then on your favourite blog (yes, this one). Coles to launch ‘AI-powered’ trolley Coles is launching a trial of an “AI-powered” smart trolley that will allow customers to scan and pay all from their trolley beginning in 2025. The tech will be first trialled at Coles’ Richmond Traders store in Melbourne from January, with customers able to learn how to use the trolleys from today until the trial commences. The trolley has sensors, an in-built scale to scan groceries including fresh produce, and a digital screen, which shows aisle locations and specials. Severe storms in parts of Queensland and NSW The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, as thunderstorms are forecast across the east today: More on the latest wage numbers The Reserve Bank should be content with these wage numbers as they have come in slightly on the lower side of expectations for both the annual and quarterly figures. Stocks have pared their losses for the day a bit (a sign that investors were a bit more hopeful of a near-term interest rate cut), while the Australian dollar is hovering a bit above 65.2 US cents. The easing in wage price increases were also matched across both the public and private sectors. Wages for the former were up a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, the least since the September quarter of 2022. For the private sector (which is about four in five jobs), wages were up 3.5%, or matching the increase in the September quarter of 2023. Independent senator David Pocock says he will be opposing the government’s misinformation and disinformation bill “unless major changes are made to the legislation”. In the video posted to YouTube, Pocock said that as it stands, “I don’t believe it takes the right approach to dealing with misinformation.” Freedom of speech and the freedom to protest are critical parts of our democracy. And in Australia, we don’t have an overarching Human Rights Act that entrenches these rights. So we need to tread very carefully whenever we make changes that may impact on them. He said that Labor and Liberal governments have cracked down on the right to protest at a state level and while misinformation and disinformation causes harm, “people are also entitled to their opinion, whatever it may be.” Pocock argued the issue is not so much with individuals spreading misinformation but the social media algorithms that boost this content – so “I find it very strange that the government wants to trust these giant corporations who have at best very questionable reputations with deciding what is or isn’t mis and disinformation”. He also criticised the government for delaying changes to the Privacy Act, which he argued would go further to protecting Australians online. The truth is really hard to define and often changes over time, so there’s a risk platforms could just end up unintentionally censoring people. The wage price index for the September quarter has come in at 3.5% compared with a year earlier, the ABS has just reported. That figure compared with the 3.6% pace expected by economists and the 4.1% clip reported by the ABS for the June quarter. At that rate, wages were increasing more than the headline inflation rate as they have since the final three months of 2023. The September quarter consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 2.8%. A similar story was true for the quarter alone, with the WPI up 0.8%, or well ahead of the 0.2% pace of CPI. Economists had tipped that to come in at 0.9% or similar to the 0.8% rate recorded by the ABS for the June quarter. Only 13% of health and medical research workforce in regional areas An audit of the Australian health and medical research workforce shows only 13% of the workforce is based in regional, rural or remote areas. The National Rural Health Alliance says this is insufficient to serve Australia’s 30% rural population, with the audit also pointing to additional barriers that exist for regional researchers. Conducted by the Department of Health and Aged Care, the audit found the health and medical research workforce is highly mobile, moving jobs every 1.6 years – suggesting researchers may be willing to move to rural areas. The National Rural Health Alliance chief executive, Susi Tegen, said: The underrepresentation of rural researchers is worrying given that rural communities face distinct health challenges that require tailored and place-based solutions … Funding for research does not adequately flow to the regions. Rural researchers become a secondary consideration for funding. They have difficulty accessing the same opportunities available to researchers in metropolitan locations. The limited access to training, funding and collaborative networks in regional areas means that researchers may be left behind, and the needs of these communities may remain unmet. Tegen called on the government to increase funding access, provide targeted training and development, and opportunities for collaborative networks to the regional workforce and researchers. Multilateral trade liberalisation ‘right strategy for geopolitical environment’: Leigh Andrew Leigh was also asked about trade with the US – as has been discussed much this morning – following Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on imports. How can Australia stop that? Leigh said “the periods of open markets have been the periods of greatest prosperity” in history, which was achieved “not just by doing cosy bilateral deals, but by engaging in broad multilateral reform”. You see us supporting the entry of the UK into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, broadening out the networks through the World Trade Organisation. Multilateral trade liberalisation doesn’t just work better, it’s also the right strategy for the current geopolitical environment. So, engaging in that with open markets is going to be what we’ll do. You’ve seen us broadening out the trading relationships through the Asia Pacific and dealing with some of the issues that we faced with around $20bn of trade blockages to China when we came to office now being dealt with steadily, methodically, by Don Farrell as trade minister. Andrew Leigh says he ‘absolutely’ expected domestic airfares to increase after collapse of Rex The assistant competition minister, Andrew Leigh, was on ABC RN earlier this morning where he discussed the increase in capital city route flights. The ACCC has found the average domestic airfare increased by 13% after the collapse of Rex flights between capital cities. Adelaide-Melbourne jumped 95% to $296, Melbourne-Gold Coast was up 70% to $432, and Canberra-Melbourne rose 54% to $298. Leigh said he was “absolutely” expecting things to get this bad this quickly: … when you move from a monopoly carrier on a route to three carriers on the route, then the price per kilometre is halved, goes down from 40 cents a kilometre to 19 cents a kilometre. So, it’s expected and disappointing that when you had that collapse that you immediately saw prices for flyers increase. Asked what the government would do about the growing cost of airfares until a new airline emerges as a serious third competitor, he said it would be a “matter for the commercial market” as to who fills that gap – and “clearly the government is looking at creating settings that make it attractive for competitors”. We’re talking now about airlines, but we’ve been talking previously about supermarkets or banks. And if you go to baby food and beer, the same challenge occurs. And that’s why the government’s focus on competition isn’t just to go sector by sector, but to revitalise national competition policy in order to see the gains right across the economy. We had more on this from treasurer Jim Chalmers earlier in the blog, here. South Australian CFA testing warning systems The South Australian Country Fire Service says it is testing its warning system today from 10.30am to 1pm: Please disregard any warnings issued during this time. Melbourne police address media after alleged armed stand-off Earlier, Melbourne police spoke to the media after an alleged armed stand-off with officers in Weir Views. Yesterday, police were monitoring a stolen vehicle when a man allegedly got out of the car and fired shots at police, who were not injured. The man then allegedly entered a house where two occupants, a man and a toddler not known to him, were inside. Police negotiated with him as the occupants left uninjured. The man allegedly fired shots at police again, with police returning fire (which did not hit him) and deploying a police dog to assist with the arrest just after 6pm. Speaking to the media, the officer said the man – a 26-year-old man from Snake Valley – is known to police but couldn’t provide further details. He said the occupant was in his 30s or early 40s and is the father of the one-year-old. He added it is “extremely lucky” that no police were injured: It is lucky, and it is completely unacceptable that members were exposed to such dangers. In terms of the negotiations police had with the man, police alleged: We attempted for him to surrender and put the firearm down. We provided safe passage for that to occur. That did not occur prior to the incident unfolding. It was two and a half hours from when the alleged offender entered the home to when he was arrested. He said the man was jumping on a trampoline at one point and “there was a period of time where he was behaving erratically in the back yard of the premises”. The officer said it is expected the alleged offender will be charged today with a range of offences including aggravated carjacking, aggravated burglary and conduct endangering life and firearms offences. The Catholic church has won a landmark case limiting its liability for the abuse of children by priests not under its direct employment. Last year, the highest Victorian court delivered an unprecedented ruling that the church was vicariously responsible for the abuse of a five-year-old child, known as DP, by assistant priest Father Bryan Coffey. The ruling was significant because Coffey, as an assistant parish priest, was not directly employed by the church. Vicarious liability is typically used to hold employers responsible for the wrongful or negligent actions of their employees during the course of their employment, regardless of whether the employer is at fault. The Victorian courts held that Coffey was a “servant of the church”, despite the lack of a formal employer-employee relationship, and that his church position gave him “power and intimacy” to access and abuse children. The high court rejected that ruling on Wednesday morning, finding in the church’s favour, and declining to expand the concept of vicarious liability beyond employer-employee relationships. It said doing so would create uncertainty and indeterminacy. Sydney Water says it has a dedicated team working to address a mosquito outbreak in south-west Sydney. The Daily Telegraph reported that the infestation has been linked to a Warwick Farm settling pond owned by Sydney Water, and neglected pools in the area. Social media users have reported an outbreak of mozzies about the south-west, and Liverpool mayor Ned Mannoun has been providing daily updates to social media on the situation. Sydney Water said in a statement that it has taken immediate action, including herbicide spraying, larvicide deployment, helicopter spraying, and aquatic vegetation removal. Operational staff and licenced contractors have deployed boats, helicopters, excavators, and other specialised machinery to clear around half of the aquatic material contributing to mosquito breeding. These measures are starting to reduce mosquito populations around the Liverpool Water Resource Recovery Facility. Sydney Water staff are on the ground talking directly with customers in the impacted areas. It said the mosquito impact is “expected to improve significantly over the next two weeks”. The former prime minister Tony Abbott has defended Australia’s ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd for his now-deleted tweets about Donald Trump. Among the deleted comments, Rudd had in 2020 described Trump as “the most destructive president in history”. On an episode of his podcast Australia’s Future with Tony Abbott, the former PM defended Rudd and said it would be “unusual for our closest ally to start being prescriptive about who can and can’t be our ambassador”. Sure, Rudd has said some injudicious things about the incoming president, but a lot of people have. A lot of people, including a lot of people on my side of politics here in Australia, have said I think injudicious and ill-advised [things] about president Trump. I’ve always taken the view that the American president is the leader of the free world. In effect he’s our president as well as the American president. And we should be careful, very careful, about public criticism of an American president – or indeed an American ex-president. Certainly, if we have to disagree let’s disagree on politics rather than the personalities. Abbott also said that whatever you think of Rudd, “you couldn’t say that the guy is not hyper active”. I am confident that Kevin has been hyper active on our behalf as he sees it in Washington. So I would be surprised if there is any pressure from the Americans to change our ambassador. I have no reason to think that Kevin is not doing a good job at present. He will do whatever he humanly can to win over senior people in the incoming administration. And he’s already done everything he humanly can to row back his previous ill-advised remarks about the incoming president. Wages data today likely to mark one year of pay rising faster than headline inflation Australia’s workers should receive some good news later today with ABS data likely to show wages have risen faster than the annual headline inflation rate for four consecutive quarters. Economists are expecting the wage price index will have risen 0.9% for the September quarter alone and 3.6% from the same quarter a year ago. Compare that increase with the 0.2% gain in the headline consumer price index numbers for the quarter and 2.8% annual rise – as we saw a couple of weeks ago – and it would be a big surprise if wages were advancing at a faster clip. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, as it happens has a speech in Sydney starting about 90 minutes after the wage price index figures land at 11.30am. In the US it has been difficult for the Biden administration (and losing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris) to get voter “cut-through” with real income gains. So it’ll be understandable for Chalmers to talk up any positive signs of the cost of living crunch easin, with an Australian federal election looming over the next six months. (As we noted here recently, there are some indications of things improving.) Anyway, stay tuned for the numbers to land here later this morning. Wrap of commentary on US-Australia relationship this morning There’s been much talk this morning about the Australia-US relationship under a second Trump presidency, and the future of Kevin Rudd’s role as ambassador after his now-deleted tweets. In case you missed it: opposition leader Peter Dutton said Rudd had “an incredible work ethic, but he’s made disparaging comments, and that’s an issue for for the government to deal with”. Dutton said: Following [Rudd’s] term, that’s an issue for the government of the day to decide who would be in that role. I think Joe Hockey, for example, did a great job when he was ambassador. Australia’s former ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos described Trump as a “transactional figure” and suggested he would be focused on the relationship going forward and “it would not be a good look to just suddenly yank the ambassador out.” You can read more earlier in the blog, here. As we flagged just earlier, a senior Trump adviser has posted a gif of an hourglass in response to Rudd’s congratulation message to the incoming president. And as AAP reports, Anthony Albanese said he remained optimistic about the trading relationship under a Trump presidency, telling ABC Radio Sydney that he and the president-elect discussed trade in their first phone call. I pointed out the United States has a trade surplus with Australia so it’s in the United States’ interest that they trade fairly with Australia. The United States is a major investor here in Australia [and] that investment creates economic activity and creates jobs. ‘Nurses and midwives are more than disappointed with this government’ The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association’s secretary, Shaye Candish, has spoken with ABC News Breakfast amid the strike action, which began this morning. The union has been negotiating with the state government since April, with the government not budging on a blanket 10.5% pay rise offered over three years for all NSW public-sector workers. Candish said nurses and midwives were asking for 15% and “it comes at a time when Queensland and Victoria are paid at least 18% above nurses here in NSW”. Nurses and midwives are more than disappointed with this government. This government committed to sit down in good faith and negotiate on pay and conditions for nurses and midwives, but has not happened … We have been bleeding nurses and midwives and that has been part of the problem. After the strike ends tomorrow morning, Candish said she hopes “the government comes to the table and finds a way to resolve this issue and put new money on the table”. That is ultimately where we hope this goes but should that not be the case, our members are determined to continue undertaking action. It will not stop until we are in a situation where members can actually have parity with other states. School anti-vaping program will teach ‘how to say no’ and to recognise addiction in friends Continuing from our last post, Mark Butler said kids often vaped thinking it wasn’t harmful: We know from our research is that teenagers think vaping is harmless. They think smoking’s bad, and they think vaping is a relatively harmless product. … The real facts about vaping [is there are] 200 very harmful chemicals in them. But also it’s a pathway to smoking … that’s important. The program goes on to teach them how to say no effectively, how to recognise addiction in friends who might be addicted to vapes and to talk to them about it. It really is an important sort of socialisation about not just how to recognise risky behaviour or risky products like vapes or alcohol or drugs for that matter, but also how to go through the process of resisting peer pressure, resisting temptation, and taking the healthy choice. A new anti-vaping program for teenagers will be run in high schools across Australia next year. The health minister, Mark Butler, gave more details about the program the government in launching today on ABC Brisbane Breakfast: This is a program targeted at year seven and eight students, a really formative age as you’re starting to be exposed to some of these risky behaviours, but also take decisions about whether you go into them or whether you say no. The program is a partnership with the University of Sydney who have been working with kids for years in areas of alcohol and illicit drug use and have now reshaped their program to around vaping. The launch of the program nationally comes after trialling it with about 5,000 high school students over the past year Butler said was “extraordinarily positive” with very high ratings from students. But also, importantly, teachers who’ve been crying out for some supports, given that they were saying right across the country vaping is now the number one behavioural issue in schools, not just high schools, too in primary schools as well, increasingly, which is just terrifying. We’re rolling out the programme now to all high schools in 2025. When the new academic year begins, all high schools will be able to do that. And I know they’re really keen to do that because when we opened up the trial, we were just overwhelmed with high schools reaching out to these providers and saying, we want something, we want to be a part of the trial. Severe thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout eastern parts of the country today. Senior meteorologist Jonathan How from the Bureau of Meteorology said thunderstorms are forecast from northern Queensland through central parts of the state, through much of eastern and inland New South Wales, eastern Victoria and potentially parts of Tasmania. In Queensland there is the possibility of severe thunderstorms around the southeast, including the border with NSW. How said “isolated very dangerous thunderstorms” could occur in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. In NSW, severe thunderstorms are likely across the north-east – including the Northern Rivers and north of Lismore. A senior Trump adviser has posted a gif of an hourglass in response to Kevin Rudd’s congratulation message to the incoming president. In a post to X on 7 November, Rudd – Australia’s ambassador to the US – shared a statement congratulation Donald Trump on his election win. This came as he deleted comments he previously made on X about Trump, saying they did not reflect the view of the Australian government. Dan Scavino, a senior advisor to Trump, quoted the post with this gif overnight: Muswellbrook mayor says region has experienced more than 50 earthquakes in three months The mayor of Muswellbrook Shire council, Jeffrey Drayton, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier after the town experienced a 4.1 magnitude earthquake yesterday. As Kate Lyons reported in yesterday’s blog, the earthquake was the fourth event over magnitude four in three months in the NSW Hunter region – and was likely part of an “earthquake swarm” that has been affecting the region for several months. Drayton said the region has experienced more than 50 earthquakes in three months: There doesn’t appear to be as much damage as there was with the first two earthquakes, it was a little bit smaller. It was 4.1 versus 4.9 earlier on. But certainly people felt it and it probably was felt … in a much wider area this time … The mayor also said residents are reporting to council that their insurance claims are not being accepted: There’s been a number of stories, you know, stories like … we think the damage is from movement of the earth, but it’s more likely blasting in the mines, so there was obviously an attempt to try and push away that liability … We’ve had some examples of people in the community who are in their 70s and 80s, been paying insurance all their life and tell us they’ve never, ever made a claim. You can only imagine that people expect the comfort of what insurance brings and certainly when they do need to claim, the insurance companies should be doing the right thing and making sure they accept these claims when they are reasonable and genuine. Ministers write to principals and parents associations about social media age limit The education minister, Jason Clare, and communication minister, Michelle Rowland, have written to peak principals and parents associations to quell concerns about Labor’s proposed ban of social media to under-16s. The move to restrict access to social media follows the decision by education ministers last year to ban access to mobile phones in public schools, in line with OECD data indicating boosted academic performance. Clare said schools were “seeing the difference” from the phone ban. Ask any teacher, any principal, ask most students and they will tell you this was the right decision. And that it’s making a difference. But when school finishes, students get their phone back and they’re back in that social media cesspit. That’s why setting a minimum age limit for social media is so important. Pat Murphy, president of the Australian Government Primary Principals Association, said more than half of his body’s students in years five and six were regularly using social media sites. Our students are facing unprecedented challenges with social media influencing their self-esteem, relationships, and concentration in the classroom. With social media’s constant comparisons and pressures, many primary school students feel overwhelmed, and they are not mature enough to deal effectively with these pressures. Man charged with murder of 75-year-old man A man has been charged with murder after the body of a 75-year-old man was found at Parkes at the weekend. The man’s body was discovered inside a home on Alluvial Street about 1.40pm last Sunday. Officers established a crime scene and following inquiries, a 28-year-old man was arrested at a home in Tullamore – about 100km north-west of Parkes – yesterday. He was taken to Parkes Police Station where he was charged with murder. He has been refused bail to appear at Parkes Local court today. The NSW Nurses and Midwives strike has officially begun, kicking off about 45 minutes ago. You can read more about this below: ABC Melbourne Breakfast presenter Sammy J has announced he is leaving his radio show after five years. Hosting Melbourne Breakfast was an unexpected opportunity that became an unexpected joy. But radio demands all of you and deserves nothing less, and after five years I’m ready to trade the 4:15 am alarm for more regular hours. Sammy farewelled listeners in his usual fashion, with a song. ABC Radio Melbourne acting manager Shelley Hadfield said Sammy had connected with the audience on 774 in a unique way: Sammy has asked the questions we never knew we wanted answered. He’s grilled the Prime Minister and the Premier, he broke the news to Melbourne of the Queen’s death, and he interviewed musicians, magicians, meat workers and mathematicians. Australia’s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, has recorded a quarterly $2.5bn cash net profit backed by “strong momentum” in home lending. Credit card and personal loan arrears fell slightly, despite enduring cost-of-living pressures, as consumers benefited from income tax rate changes. Home loan arrears were stable over the three-month period. The CBA chief executive, Matt Comyn, said: Growth in the Australian economy remains slow, as higher rates continue to weigh on consumer demand and bring inflation back to the target range. We remain optimistic on the overall outlook and the Australian economy remains fundamentally sound. The bank recorded growth in home loans and deposits during the quarter, helping its earnings. The September quarter result was in line with last year’s corresponding period. Former US ambassador Sinodinos on second Trump presidency Australia’s former ambassador to the US, Arthur Sinodinos, was on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss the second Trump presidency. Sinodinos said Trump “says what he means and means what he says” and policies around tariffs and immigration are core promises of his – but Trump thinks other countries pay tariffs when in fact they’re passed on to US consumers: We’ll have a bit of a challenge to explain some of this to him but he’s determined to do this … The big focus will be on what he tries to do with China … Complicated is one way to describe it. On the Australia-US relationship and Kevin Rudd’s deleted tweets, Sinodinos said the president was a “transactional figure” and he would be focused on the relationship going forward. In relation to Australia I think he has a benign view of Australia … we’re a strong partner in defence, we more than pull our weight, so we’re in reasonably good shape compared to other countries … It would not be a good look to just suddenly yank the ambassador out. He said Australia would have to tout its benefits to the US, rather than relying on them: I think we should always talk about the value we provide [and] our value as a middle power … the important regional groupings. We have a lot of influence, we shouldn’t be afraid to use it … and we should have the ambition that goes with that. One-third of referred telco complaints unresolved A third of complaints made by telco consumers to the sector’s ombudsman remained unresolved at the end of the latest reporting period, AAP reports. The figures, between July and September of 2024, found 30%, or 3,389, of complaints returned unresolved after a referral to a telco in relation to issues including poor customer service, problems with bills or equipment, and service drop outs. This followed the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman beginning a new follow-up process with consumers to get a better picture of resolutions at the end of the referral period. A total of 13,541 complaints about phone and internet services were lodged between July and September of 2024. This figure constitutes a 4.6% increase on complaints in the same period in 2023, or a total of 599 additional complaints. More than half the complaints made by customers related to no or delayed action from a telco, followed by complaints about service and equipment fees and complaints about no phone or internet service. Complaints raised in relation to failure to cancel a service, where a customer claims a telco has not terminated an agreement properly, jumped by 7% since the previous quarter. The top five local government areas with the highest number of complaints were Brisbane (426), Gold Coast (279), Moreton Bay (251), Sunshine Coast (199) and Wyndham (198). These five areas alone contributed 10% of all the complaints received in this reporting period. Albanese on social media ban: ‘We don’t pretend this is easy [or] you can just flick a switch’ Anthony Albanese was also asked about moves to ban under-16s from social media, and the privacy concerns around this – will everyone need to prove they are over 18? How would this policy actually be implemented and regulated? He responded that there will be one year to develop the details, and that there would be a trial of age verification: There’ll be detail in the legislation but we don’t pretend this is easy [or] you can just flick a switch … Parents won’t be penalised, people won’t be penalised, the onus will be on these social media companies. ‘Increasingly we’re seeing … opinion reported as fact’ Moving to the misinformation bill, Anthony Albanese said what is important is that “there is a distinction between fact and opinion”. Increasingly we’re seeing in the media things that are opinion reported as fact and that is a concern for people. The changing media landscape where everyone can be a producer as well with their device means society has to respond to that. It’s not easy, the whole world is grappling with this. Albanese says Australia can play a role in US and China ‘competition’ Anthony Albanese is speaking with ABC Sydney before he leaves for South America to attend APEC and the G20 leaders’ summit. Asked if he would be meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, Albanese said the “strategic competition” between the US and China is “something we’re dealing with” and that Australia can play a role as a middle power, because “we’re trusted and our word matters”. The prime minister said that during his recent call with Donald Trump after his US election win, he told him it was in the US’s interest to trade with Australia and that Australia was in one of the fastest growing regions in human history. Dutton on Rudd as US ambassador: ‘He’s got an incredible work ethic, but he’s made disparaging comments’ Peter Dutton was also asked if ambassador Kevin Rudd would remain in his role as US ambassador under a Coalition government. This comes after Rudd deleted comments he previously made about Trump after the Republican’s election win, saying they did not reflect the view of the Australian government. Dutton told ABC RN the Coalition has supported Rudd in his role as ambassador and “it’s important that he does work in our country’s name”: He’s been a very effective contributor to public debate, particularly as a former prime minister is well respected, and I hope that he’s able to form a relationship with the new administration, as he’s done with with the current one. He’s got an incredible work ethic, but he’s made disparaging comments, and that’s an issue for for the government to deal with. Asked if the opposition would like to see Scott Morrison in the role, Dutton said Rudd has a term to finish: Following that term, that’s an issue for the government of the day to decide who would be in that role. I think Joe Hockey, for example, did a great job when he was ambassador. Peter Dutton says he supports the right of women to access legal abortion but will not (NOT) require the Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and the South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic to withdraw a sponsored bill to change abortion law. The opposition leader old ABC RN earlier that Canavan and Antic were entitled to sponsor the bill, which has been on the Senate notice paper for two years, and he would not be issuing instructions either for or against presenting it: I’m not advocating that they withdraw their bill or put it forward. They as senators – as the Labor senators, the Green senators, David Pocock, the independents – have the right to put forward a private member’s bill. In most cases – 99% of the cases – the bill won’t get forward unless it’s got the support of the government. So if the government’s playing games, then that’s an issue for them, but for us, our senators have a right to put their own bills forward and it can be voted on on that basis. Last week, Dutton used his weekly private address to coalition MPs to urge them to show more “discipline” and stop speaking publicly about the abortion issue because it was potentially politically damaging. This morning, he offered his personal view on the issue: I support a women’s right - a woman’s right to choose. And I’ve been in very difficult circumstances, where, as a detective working in the sex offender squad, I’ve dealt with women who have been raped. I’ve dealt with women in domestic relationships who have been raped. It’s a very, very difficult situation, and ultimately, that’s a choice and a decision for that individual to make, and that’s the position I support. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers will today announce funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Launching the plan in a speech to the Australian Business Economists in Sydney, Chalmers is hoping the plan will will incentivise states to achieve productivity gains through pro-competitive policies such as streamlining commercial planning and zoning, and removing barriers to the uptake of modern construction methods. This is noteworthy, recalling Australia’s competition policy in the late 90s under John Howard, paying states for microeconomic reform. The Albanese government already has payments to incentivise states to build houses – could this now extend to zoning too? Chalmers will say that the government has been “revitalising national competition policy with states and territories since last December”. In March this year, on behalf of the Council on Federal Financial Relations, I asked the Productivity Commission to model the potential impacts of a revitalised NCP. Its final report landed this month and the benefits on offer are substantial, if not staggering. The PC found a revitalised NCP could boost GDP by up to $45bn a year and reduce prices by 1.45 percentage points. That GDP boost represents about $5,000 per household, per year. But it reflects tough reforms and takes commitment from the Commonwealth, states and territories. On 29 November I will meet with my counterparts to kick off this work. While not every option modelled by the PC will become policy, we want to make meaningful progress where we can. I expect we’ll start by fast-tracking the adoption of trusted international product safety standards and developing a general right to repair – both Commonwealth-led reforms. Both involve small implementation costs but provide significant benefits: in the order of $5bn over the next 10 years for product safety; and over $400m per annum for right to repair. Full Story podcast: the high cost of Australia’s dental care divide In today’s Full Story podcast, we look at why dental care in Australia is largely privatised and nearly always expensive. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, almost one in five adults delay or don’t see a dentist due to cost. For those who can access the public system, staff are often overstretched and the long wait times mean crucial appointments come far too late. Guardian Australia health reporter Natasha May speaks to Reged Ahmed about how the perfect smile is a privilege increasingly available only to the wealthy: The Greens will announce a $100m a year plan to ensure public hospitals across the country will be able to provide abortion services. The party’s spokesperson for women, Larissa Waters, said access to affordable abortion services should not be a “postcode lottery” or “culture war” debate after it was raised as an issue by some in the Coalition. The Greens expect the announcement to fund hospitals who don’t yet offer the services would cost around $307m to 2027-28 if it was adopted from July 2025. While the minor party cannot form government in its own right, it could influence the next federal government if it were to pick up a number of seats to form a minority government with one of the major parties. Waters said those living in rural and regional areas often had to travel far or pay for expensive private services in order to access an abortion: Reproductive healthcare must not be a culture war or a postcode lottery. No one should fall through the cracks when it comes to accessing vital healthcare ... We’ve seen conservatives in Queensland, South Australia and the USA open the culture war again and it’s critical Labor take this opportunity to make sure every person in the country can access the reproductive healthcare they need. The NT Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price recently reopened debate at the federal level after she condemned later-term abortion, which she described as anything after the first trimester. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, told Coalition MPs earlier this month not to fuel a federal debate on abortion laws, declaring there would be no change to the opposition’s policy if he wins government. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties – thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I’ll be with you through most of our rolling coverage today. See something that needs attention? You can always get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s get started. The gambling comapny Tabcorp has been fined more than $260,000 for accepting bets during 69 tennis matches over a six-month period. Australian law prohibits bets being placed during live sport matches to limit gambling harm and the risk of match fixing. The Australian Communications and Media Authority’s Carolyn Lidgerwood said she was concerned the breach – which was due to a technical error in Tabcorp’s systems – was not fixed for six months. Tabcorp is a major wagering operator and it is concerning that it took some 6 months for the system error to be identified and fixed. There has been significant growth in online sports betting in recent years and it’s important all online wagering services have systems in place so that illegal in-play bets are not accepted. According to the regulator, Tabcorp voided all bets, which meant consumers did not suffer losses and the company did not profit from its error. In 2021, Tabcorp escaped punishment for accepting in-play bets on a US college basketball game as it promised to fix an error that allowed them to be accepted. Australian Federal Police raided multiple locations in Melbourne’s western suburbs last night as part of an investigation into alleged fraud against the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The searches were led by the National Disability Insurance Agency‘s (NDIA) anti-fraud taskforce and supported by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and other agencies. Government agencies worked to ensure the safety of NDIS participants during the operation. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, told Guardian Australia the raids were “part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent activity against the NDIS”. I established the fraud fusion taskforce (FFT) two years ago to combat any attempts by serious criminals attempting to infiltrate the NDIS and other government support systems. The FFT has wide-reaching powers, with the taskforce now comprising 21 government agencies working together and sharing information. I have complete confidence in the FFT as they undertake this important work to tackle any serious criminal activity that comes at the expense of Australians who rely on such supports. No arrests were made during the operation and the investigation is ongoing. A two-year-old boy has died after being pulled from a dam in regional New South Wales, police have said. In a statement, NSW police said emergency services were called to a property on Pipers Flat Road, Portland in the state’s central west, about 3pm on Tuesday. They were responding to reports of a concern for welfare, police said, adding that they found the child had been pulled from a dam on the property when they arrived. Police said the boy was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being taken to Bathurst Hospital in a critical condition, where he later died. Police have said their inquiries into the incident continue, with a report to be prepared for the coroner. Guardian Australia understands police are not treating the boy’s death as suspicious. Girls are now seeing porn for the first time at 13.6 years, on average – two years younger than they were in 2018. And more than 70% of young people say porn often shows aggression and violence towards women, a new report from Our Watch has found. Patty Kinnersly, the chief executive of Our Watch, said young people are using porn to learn about sex, and that it has been normalised with greater online access. She said: Our Watch’s concern is with the representation of certain people, particularly women, rather than porn itself. It’s the frequent viewing of violent porn, that is sexist and derogatory, [and] associated with a greater likelihood of men and boys holding attitudes that can lead to violence against women. Kinnersly said porn overwhelmingly shows women as submissive, and men as controlling, and that it has made the dangerous practice of choking mainstream. Research published earlier this year found almost 60% of people under 35 had been choked at least once. Parents might not realise the extent of porn use, and the extent to which the internet and porn is “flooded with misogyny and hate for women, for LGBTI+” and others, Kinnersly said: The line between IRL [in real life] and online is very blurry, so we can’t just say certain types of porn are bad… we’ve actually got to take proactive actions across the rest of a young person’s life so they can critique it. Our Watch wants to see pornography literacy integrated into nation-wide education about respectful relationships, and for parents to understand the new world their children are in. The New South Wales health minister, Ryan Park, said last night he was preparing the state’s hospital system to cope with today’s nurses’ strike. He said the industrial action – due to start at 7.30am – would mean planned surgeries being postponed and longer wait times in emergency departments. I want to assure the community that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact of this on their care. NSW Health is working hard to ensure postponed surgeries are rescheduled as quickly as reasonably possible. I also remind the community of pathways to care for non-life-threatening conditions outside of the emergency department – by first phoning Healthdirect on 1800 022 222, where you can speak to a registered nurse about your care options – potentially avoiding an unnecessary wait in the hospital. He added that over the course of four weeks of negotiations the state government had reached agreement on all of the nurses’ non-wage claims, and put forward options to fund and deliver a new increased wage offer. He claimed that the Nurses &amp; Midwives Association had previously agreed to cease industrial action contingent on the government paying nurses and midwives an interim increase while work towards a final settlement remained ongoing. But feeling among nurses has been inflamed by news that the police force have been given a 40% pay rise. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer bringing you some of the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Emily Wind to take over. Nurses and midwives in New South Wales will stage a 24-hour strike from 7.30am this morning amid anger over the state government’s decision to grant NSW police a 40% pay deal. Members of the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association are calling on the Minns government to address the wage disparity that has left the state’s nurses and midwives the lowest paid in the country. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said he was “disappointed” about the strike. More coming up. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today announce funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. He hopes the plan will encourage states to achieve productivity gains through pro-competitive policies such as streamlining planning laws. More coming up. Federal police raided a number of locations in Melbourne’s western suburbs last night as part of an investigation into alleged fraud against the National Disability Insurance Scheme. More shortly."

                    "bodyText": "The PlayStation 5 Pro was announced in September, and immediately people reacted with disbelief to the price: £699/$699, without a disc drive. Adjusted for inflation, it is the second-most expensive games console ever released – beaten only by the PlayStation 3, whose price was quickly slashed when it turned out nobody was willing to work a second job to afford one. It’s an addition to, rather than a replacement for, the original PS5 model. All games released so far work on the Pro, and all future PS5 games will work on both models. For your money, you get an upgraded GPU (graphics processing unit), which is overall 45% more powerful that the original PS5’s; AI upscaling, which makes images more detailed; and advanced ray tracing, which makes the lighting better. In plain English, it’s supposed to make all PS5 games prettier and faster. My partner and I bought one last week, with an added disc drive to complement the 2TB of storage (an extra £100, though they are now in short supply). For context: I mostly play games on my Steam Deck or my Nintendo Switch, and can only just tell the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS. I appreciate a gorgeous game – God of War and Ratchet and Clank have blown me away on PS5 – but graphical performance is not hugely important to me. My partner, meanwhile, is a lifelong early adopter and PC gamer who is very invested in his tech. Here is our verdict. The idea behind this console upgrade is removing all compromises. The original PS5’s graphical options let you pick between fidelity and performance – how good everything looks v how fast everything moves. Choose fidelity and the lighting and detail of each scene will be better, but the frame rate will be lower. Choose performance and the frame rate will be higher, making things feel silky-smooth during play, but some of the fancier lighting effects and detail are turned off. With the PS5 Pro, the compromises have been removed: now you can have the higher detail at a higher frame rate. As to whether you can actually see this difference will depend a lot on your TV. If you don’t have a 4K TV, for instance, there is absolutely no point in this console. Most high-end TVs now have a lot of built-in effects and features that smooth out frame rates and otherwise improve the look and performance of what you’re playing, so the difference might not look as huge as you’re expecting. Personally, as someone who is not invested at all in high-end tech, I can see and feel a small but noticeable difference when I compare the same game on PS5 and Pro on our 4K TV. My partner, whose eye is better trained for these things, feels that the contrast is more obvious. This lack of compromise is what tech-minded gamers hoped for from this generation of consoles in the first place, so it is nice to finally have it. Indeed, I reckon the ideal customer for the PS5 Pro is someone who’s been holding off on buying a PS5 because it didn’t feel like enough of an upgrade from the PS4. Most people are unlikely to play a PS5 exclusive such as Spider-Man 2 or Horizon Forbidden West again simply because it’s a little better-looking on an upgraded console. But if you’ve never played these games in the first place then you’ll now be able to enjoy them at their very best. Speaking of enjoying games at their best: this console has a feature called PS5 Pro Game Boost, which enhances all the 8,500+ backwards-compatible PlayStation 4 games as well. Some of the PS4’s best games have been specifically remastered for PS5 already, including The Last of Us parts I and II and Horizon Zero Dawn, but plenty haven’t, and they benefit hugely from this upgrade. The difference here would be noticeable to anyone. Typically, Sony has released these upgraded consoles just after the midpoint of a PlayStation’s lifespan, so we can assume we’ll get three to four years’ worth of use out of the PS5 Pro before the PlayStation 6 comes along. As for whether it’s worth the money? If you already have a really nice TV, you like to have the latest tech, and you haven’t already played every PS5 game worth playing, you will, like my partner, be very happy with it. It’s a nice-to-have, rather than an essential. You can be reassured that if, like me, you balk at paying this much for any games console, you are not missing out on much."

                    "bodyText": "Thanks for following today. Here’s a wrap of the biggest stories: One person is dead and a child has been taken to hospital with serious injuries after a a truck crashed into a kindergarten in Riddells Creek, about 45km north-west of Melbourne. A man has died after being crushed beneath a turbine blade while working at a regional Victorian windfarm, with a union claiming safety concerns at the site were raised at a meeting two weeks ago. The opposition transport spokesperson Bridget McKenzie has defended herself after revelations she failed to declare 16 flight upgrades over the past nine years, saying her history of criticising the lack of competition in Australian aviation is important to note, adding she thought: “Anthony Albanese, has been influenced by his personal and financial relationship with Qantas.” At the Geelong Botanic Gardens, a rare corpse plant began blooming this afternoon. The corpse flower only blooms once every 10 years or so. Private Richard Norden, a 19-year-old Australian soldier who rescued his wounded commander while seriously injured and under enemy gunfire in the Vietnam war, has been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Rachael Gunn, better known as Raygun, has said she is not retiring from breaking despite reports suggesting she would. We’ll see you back here tomorrow. Climate activists glued to Melbourne sculpture unfurl banner saying ‘You don’t need to glue yourself to an artwork’ Activists glued themselves to a sculpture at the entrance of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and unfurled a banner saying: “You don’t need to glue yourself to an artwork to drive urgent climate action”. A spokesperson for the climate activist group Rouser said two of its members were doing what they were telling other people they didn’t have to do, to show the public they could drive urgent climate action without taking extreme, disruptive measures. “Activists are only glueing on to artworks, blockading traffic and disrupting public events because so few everyday people are driving urgent action,” Rouser’s creative director Rob Beamish said. “But if enough people have regular conversations, there’s hope for the cultural change that will lead to real climate action.” The David Shrigley bronze, called Really Good, was not damaged during the protest, which lasted for about 90 minutes before police successfully unglued the protesters. NSW police win pay rises of up to 40% in biggest wage increase in 30 years Police in New South Wales are set to be the best paid in the nation, thanks to a “generational” wage increase of up to 40% under a new pay deal. The deal comes amid threats of industrial action from nurses and transport workers battling the state government for better pay offers. More than 10,000 constables, senior constables and sergeants will receive increases of at least 25% before shift allowances while pay scales have been simplified. It means the salary for a level 3 senior constable will jump from $107,600 to $146,600 by mid-2027. The four-year deal, which includes backpay to 1 July, is in line with what the union had demanded and officials have asked members to accept the government’s offer. “We set the bar high and for good reason,” the Police Association of NSW president, Kevin Morton, told members on Monday. “For the vast majority of members, this is a generational change to your award. “This offer will see the highest pay increases achieved in the last 30 years for NSW Police [and] outstrips what we have seen accepted by other public-sector agencies.” Full story here: ‘It stinks’: reports from the once-in-a-decade flowering of Geelong’s corpse plant Our reporter Henry Belot has been suffering for his craft today, covering the once-in-a-decade flowering of the “corpse plant”. “It stinks,” is his professional appraisal of the situation. Despite this, people have turned out in huge numbers to witness the botanical event. Senators and experts grill department officials on mentions of populist parties in mis- and disinformation bill Throughout the course of the hearing on the misinformation and disinformation bill today, opposition and crossbench senators as well as legal experts have been concerned about a part of the explanatory memorandum for the bill that mentions examples of populist parties in other parts of the world that have had success politically as a result of disinformation allegedly spread by those parties. The document says Australia hasn’t experienced this yet but “experience from around the world suggests that content of this nature, if disseminated at scale, can influence public opinion and sway voter behaviour to such an extent that the outcome of an electoral process can no longer be said to represent the free will of the electorate”. LNP senator Matt Canavan said it was one of the “most remarkable paragraphs” he’d ever read in a bill or memorandum, and questioned the communications department about its inclusion and what the meaning of it was. The department’s deputy secretary of communications and media, James Chisholm, said it wasn’t about the party or the person making the comments, but the disinformation being spread. He said: So electoral integrity here is concerned with ensuring that factual information is made available to the public, rather than disinformation and misinformation about candidates or the electoral process itself. We’re not concerned here about the party itself, its beliefs. We’re not concerned about the authors of the information as much about the statements, the content, and whether or not they are mis- or disinformation, which would then also need to have the significant, far reaching consequences, as defined in the bill. Chisholm said the bill wasn’t about censorship, but codes the platforms undertake to deal with misinformation and disinformation, building on the existing industry-developed voluntary code. Husic questioned on effect of Trump presidency on regulating AI and social media The industry minister, Ed Husic, has been asked about how the Albanese government will respond to a Donald Trump presidency in the fields of artificial intelligence and social media regulation. The context for the questions was Trump’s promise to repeal Biden’s artificial intelligence executive order and the influence of Elon Musk over Trump. On AI, Husic told reporters in Canberra: We will harmonise where we can and localise where we have to. That is, we will work with other [countries] where we absolutely can find common ground, to give people the assurance in the Australian context about the use of AI, we will take the steps necessary so people have the confidence to use it. On social media, particularly whether Trump could oppose Labor’s misinformation and disinformation bill, Husic said: We take our responsibility to the Australian people seriously. I think people here want us to be able to deal with issues in a way that reflects our national priorities. And so I think you’ll see we continue to do what we have to do. This follows vice president-elect, JD Vance, warning America’s allies in Nato to “respect free speech”. Vance said: Nato wants us to continue us being a good participant in this military alliance – why don’t you respect American values and respect free speech? It’s insane that we would support a military alliance if that military alliance isn’t going to be pro free speech. I think we can do both, but we have to say that American power comes with certain strings attached, one of those is: respect free speech. Only a couple of weeks ago, odds seemed to favour the development of a La Niña event in the Pacific, a climate driver that tends to bring wetter-than-usual conditions to much of Australia. The latest run of the Bureau of Meteorology’s main Access model, though, has all but ruled out La Niña this year, or into 2025. BoM had been a bit of an outlier among global weather agencies in estimating La Niña would soon be under way. (Its US counterpart, NOAA, still rates the odds of one as a 60% chance, although they have a lower threshold to declare one.) While sea surface temperatures have taken on La Niña-like characteristics, the atmosphere above hasn’t “coupled” in a way that reinforces the conditions needed for an event to take hold. (Some experts had been doubtful for a while that we could go from three La Ninas in a row to El Niño and back to La Niña. Such a combination would have been a first as far as records go. That said, climate change can mean the past isn’t always a guide to the future.) Anyway, BoM’s model run also has conditions in the Indian Ocean shifting back towards neutral. They had been in the “negative phase” that tends to produce above-average rainfall for a lot of Australia. The bureau will provide its fortnightly update of the main climate drivers influencing Australia’s weather on Tuesday afternoon. Perhaps we’ll see them drop their “La Niña Watch” reading for the Pacific. Criminal trial date set for former ATO official Richard Boyle The criminal trial against Richard Boyle, a former Australian Taxation Office official, has been scheduled for three weeks in November 2025. At a directions hearing in a South Australian district court on Monday morning, the former ATO employee was told he’d face trial in a year’s time. Boyle’s final attempt at avoiding a criminal trial was unsuccessful after the high court last week dismissed his application to appeal an earlier ruling preventing him from using whistleblower protections. Boyle has been charged with 24 offences, including the alleged use of his mobile phone to take photographs of taxpayer information and to covertly record conversations with colleagues. Boyle went to the media about the agency’s pursuit of debts, including the use of orders that require a bank to hand over money from a personal or business account without the permission of the taxpayer, after initially attempting to report the concerns internally and to the inspector general of taxation. The former ATO official had attempted to use protections under the Public Interest Disclosure Act to shield him for any criminal offences undertaken while preparing the disclosure. In March 2023, the district court judge Liesl Kudelka, however, said the law was “silent” on whether whistleblowers should be protected for allegedly criminal acts done while collecting evidence or investigating before a disclosure.

Victoria police said: “It’s believed at this early stage a truck collided with a kindergarten on Main Road around 2.20pm.” “One adult, who is yet to be formally identified, has died at the scene. A child was injured and has been taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries,” police said in a statement. The driver of the truck has been taken to hospital for observation. Police said the exact circumstances are still being investigated and are asking anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Severe thunderstorm warning for Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes and Plains A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for parts of northern NSW over the next several hours. The Bureau of Meteorology said a surface trough is lying through northern parts of the state with “very moist, unstable conditions to its east”. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, large hailstones and damaging winds in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Glen Innes, Guyra and Emmaville. ‘Not just another statistic,’ union says of worker’s death at windfarm The Australian Workers Union says it is frustrated and angry following news a worker was killed at the Golden Plains windfarm in Rokewood this morning. AWU Victoria state secretary Ronnie Hayden said “this devastating loss could have been prevented”. Just two weeks ago, union delegates from three different unions met with Vestas management to raise serious safety concerns, telling them it was only dumb luck that nobody had been killed on site yet. The incident occurs against a backdrop of mounting safety concerns at the project, the AWU claimed, saying it has consistently raised concern on the pressure facing workers due to project delays. This is not just another statistic, this is a worker who went to work and never came home. Anthony Pratt, one of Australia’s richest men, has announced he has been granted a green card and will move to the United States. The billionaire head of Pratt Industries announced his move in a post to LinkedIn earlier today, where he listed three reasons it was “time to live in America”: (1) My family are all US citizens. (2) Over the past 30 years we have invested to build 70 factories in America, creating 12,000 well-paying American manufacturing jobs. (3) I will remain chairman of Visy Australia, and will be returning to Australia on a regular basis. At the Geelong Botanic Gardens, a rare corpse plant is expected to begin blooming this afternoon. Also known as amorphophallus titanum, the corpse flower only blooms once every 10 years or so. The bloom lasts only 24 to 48 hours, with a powerful smell released – likened to rotting flesh. An update from the Gardens at midday said the plant had begun opening, and our very own Henry Belot is on his way to the scene to bring us the latest. In the meantime, you can follow along with the livestream below: Lingering doubts, end of subsidies put EVs in slow lane Misconceptions and the early removal of rebates have put the brakes on electric car sales, an industry group warns, as figures show adoption has slowed. But as AAP reports, the sales of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles continued to accelerate over the last six months despite challenging economic conditions, according to analysis by the Australian Automobile Association. The peak motoring body has released a quarterly update to its online Electric Vehicle Index showing new vehicle sales dropping 7.6% in the third quarter of the year, with almost 15,000 fewer cars sold. Sales of internal combustion engine vehicles dropped further than the average, falling 9.1% during the three-month period, but electric vehicles slid by 25%. Battery-powered cars made up 6.5% of all new cars sold, down from 8.1% last quarter, which is their lowest market share since 2022. The results came after the removal of rebates for electric car sales in every state and territory except Western Australia. Despite the fall in electric vehicle sales, lower-emission hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles have surged in Australia. Hybrid vehicle sales increased by 3.3% to more than 48,000 sales during the quarter, or a share of more than 16%, while plug-in hybrid car sales jumped by 56.6% from a lower base. Some plug-in hybrid vehicles are eligible for fringe benefit tax cuts from the federal government, though these incentives are due to expire in April 2025. Liberals pick former RSL chief to take on teal MP in Mackellar A former space-industry boss and Liberal prime minister’s son-in-law says he will help reduce the pressure of rising rents, mortgages and food prices if elected to federal parliament. As AAP reports, James Brown is expected to be endorsed in the coming days as the Liberal candidate for Mackellar as the party tries to wrest back the northern Sydney seat from teal independent Sophie Scamps. The 44-year-old father of two spent more than a decade in the Australian army before serving as president of RSL NSW and chief executive of the Space Industry Association. His national profile was also boosted through his marriage to Daisy Turnbull, the daughter of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, before the pair separated during the pandemic. Brown previously had preselection tilts at Liberal Senate seats left vacant by former defence minister Marise Payne and the late Jim Molan. He was also heavily involved in the party’s recent failed campaign to retain the state seat of Pittwater, which makes up about half of Mackellar. The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, looking at the storms forecast for south-east Queensland and north-east NSW: Vestas ‘working closely with emergency services’ after worker died at its Victorian windfarm Danish energy company Vestas has released a statement after a man died while working at its regional Victorian windfarm this morning. Victoria police say the man was crushed by a blade shortly after 8am at Golden Plains windfarm in Rokewood, about 133km west of Melbourne and 69km north-west of Geelong. In a statement, a Vestas spokesperson says a “workplace accident” occurred: The site has been closed and we are working closely with emergency services and the authorities. The spokesperson says Danny Nielsen, senior vice president and country head for Vestas Australia and New Zealand, will provide an update to the media outside the site at 3pm. Myki slowly recovering after readers unable to be used following 3G shutdown Victoria’s ageing public transport ticketing system, Myki, is slowly recovering after readers were unable to be used when Telstra shuttered its 3G network last week. The readers use mobile networks to ensure users can touch on. The issue affected trams and buses across the Victorian public transport network last week, despite – as Guardian Australia revealed – the Victorian government investing $3.3m into upgrading the outdated Myki ticketing system in preparation for the 3G network being shut down. A software update has been issued, and all trams should now have functioning Myki readers, the department said, as 91% of vehicles with issues have been fixed. The remaining buses affected are expected to be fixed in the coming days. A department of transport and planning spokesperson said: Crews are making progress rectifying the issue - with the majority of buses and all trams back online. The issue comes ahead of a replacement Myki system expected to be rolled out across Victoria next year. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has rejected a push from some on his backbench including Keith Pitt and Matt Canavan to dump Australia’s commitment to net zero due to the election of Donald Trump. Littleproud was asked if Peter Dutton – who also supports keeping the commitment – should revisit it. He told Sky News: No. And while President Trump’s made some soundings about that, you have got to understand your place in the world. They are 330m people, we’re 27m people, we’re a trading nation. The only people that will hurt out of that will be our farmers and our mining sector. Because what will happen is while we think we can go and lead the world on it, what will happen is we will get a tariff whacked on our commodity. So, we might want to beat our chest and sound big about it, but you have got to understand where the world is. Now the world has all signed up to this, but we don’t need to experience what the country is at the moment, which is trying to achieve it all by 2030. We will do it in a uniquely Australian way, and we’ll take our time to do it and do it properly, so that there isn’t an impact on the economy. And that is why, as leader of the Nationals, I am the first leader to be able to get the Coalition to agree to nuclear energy being part of that grid, to have that complement and supplement with gas and coal, with [carbon capture and storage] and having some renewables. We will have a balance, we’ll do it properly, we’ll do it sensibly. But I think we should just take a deep breath on trying to be Trump-esque here in Australia, because there are unintended consequences, and they are farmers and miners. You’ll note that Littleproud’s comments are largely directed at his internal detractors, arguing that he’s done more than predecessors (or potential successors) on nuclear power. BoM predicts thunderstorms in south-east Queensland and north-east NSW In more weather news, severe thunderstorms are forecast in south-eastern Queensland and north-east NSW this afternoon, as we flagged earlier. Here are some maps from the Bureau of Meteorology, showing the areas affected: Watch and act for bushfire in Queensland The Queensland Fire Department has issued a watch and act warning for the rural town of Forsayth amid a large, slow-moving fire. The warning area covers Forsayth Airport and Stockman Creek Road, including Forsayth township, Einasleigh Road and Curralle Station, and says: A large, slow-moving fire is burning Einasleigh Road. It is travelling towards Forsayth. Conditions could get worse quickly. People are urged to avoid driving on Einasleigh Road. The governor general and prime minister have announced the posthumous awarding of the Victoria Cross, Australia’s highest military honour, to Private Richard Norden, a veteran of the Vietnam war. Norden, then aged 19, ran into enemy fire after his platoon was ambushed during the Battle of Fire Support Base Coral in 1968, one of a series of actions fought between Australia and North Vietnamese forces near Saigon, to recover a wounded comrade and then retrieve the body of another. Governor general Sam Mostyn said at a Remembrance Day event in Canberra, announcing the honour: The Victoria Cross for Australia is Australia’s highest military honour, the awarding of it speaks to Private Norden’s courage and selflessness in the heat of battle, his ongoing legacy and the bravery of generations of our service personnel. This is an historic occasion for Australia and the Australian Defence Force, and a very significant day for Private Norden’s loved ones. There has been a strong campaign to see Norden awarded the Victoria Cross, uniting many within the Australian military community. Norden, who died in 1972 from injuries sustained in a police motorcycle accident, while serving in the Australian Capital Territory police, was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) before his death, but many felt this was inadequate. Anthony Albanese acknowledged the campaign for Norden to receive the Victoria Cross in his Remembrance Day address: In honouring Richard Norton and all he fought for, Australia also honours all those who fought for him: his fellow veterans, those who served alongside him, and those who took up his cause when they learned of his story. Everyone who kept alive the memory of his valour, everyone who has championed and advocated due recognition of Richard Norden, and everyone who has kept faith with Australia’s promise to remember all those who have served and their loved ones. A man has died while working at a windfarm in Victoria, police have confirmed. In a statement, police said the man was working at Rokewood windfarm when he was crushed beneath a fan blade shortly after 8am this morning. First responders attempted to revive him but he was declared dead at the scene. WorkSafe will investigate the incident, police said. Misinformation makes emergency responses difficult, Senate inquiry hears The National Emergency Management Agency has warned misinformation and disinformation online makes emergency responses more difficult. The deputy coordinator general, Joel Buffone, told a Senate inquiry that the example of recent misinformation and disinformation spread about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in the US in response to floods there “put staff at risk” and forced Fema staff to withdraw. He also pointed to the recent Crowdstrike outage, which took down millions of Windows computers worldwide and threw many services into chaos: Straight away there was effectively using platforms to effectively run scams, and there was a whole lot of misinformation. He said misinformation about the 2019 bushfires – where arsonists with a political motive were falsely blamed for causing fires – almost immediately had an impact on social cohesion. Blue banded bee wins ABC’s first Insect of the Year poll The native blue banded bee has won the ABC’s first Insect of the Year poll. Just over 50.1% of voters (6,815) chose the blue banded bee from six insect finalists. The common hoverfly received the second highest number of votes (13%), followed by the Bogong moth (11.4%). The blue banded bee was cited by environment minister Tanya Plibersek as one reason why the site of a proposed goldmine near Blayney should be issued an Aboriginal heritage protection order. As Calla Wahlquist reported, the basis of the protection declaration was a claim that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were the site of pre-initiation ceremonies in Wiradyuri culture and that the river itself was the subject of the Blue Banded Bee dreaming. The Insect of the Year poll was conducted by the ABC for four weeks during October and November. Governor general begins Remembrance Day address The governor general, Sam Mostyn, has begun a commemorative address at the Remembrance Day service at the War Memorial in Canberra. Mostyn noted it was her first Remembrance Day as governor general and said she was honoured to address the crowd before the Stone of Remembrance as the daughter of an army officer. For more than a century, Australians have repeated this ritual of remembrance, just as we do gathering today. Each year, we render our tribute anew to the generations of servicemen and women who have died or suffered for Australia in conflicts far from home. And so it is, our Remembrance Days are born of all the days of commemoration that have gone before. Anti-slavery advocates welcome appointment of national commissioner Anti-slavery advocates have welcomed the appointment of former senator Chris Evans as Australia’s first anti-slavery commissioner. Evans’s appointment to a five-year term was announced by the attorney general. Alison Rahill, program manager of the Australian Catholic Anti-slavery Network, said Evans could draw on his “formidable experience in government and the private sector to make a difference to the estimated 41,000 people experiencing modern slavery right here in Australia and 50 million people worldwide”. This must include examining economic, migration, corporate governance, social and trade policies settings that currently undermine Australia’s anti-slavery ambitions. As we flagged earlier, the NSW anti-slavery commissioner Dr James Cockayne said Evans’s appointment was “encouraging on several levels”. Cockayne said the inaugural national anti-slavery commissioner had numerous challenges ahead: With regulators overseas increasingly ratcheting up expectations of Australian businesses’ modern slavery and human rights due diligence, including in thorny cases like cotton and tomatoes coming from Xinjiang, it is crucial that government sets clear expectations for Australian business on what is expected of them to manage these risks. Otherwise, Australian business will find it increasingly hard to access overseas markets and capital, especially from Europe. Constitutional lawyer speaks on government’s proposed misinformation and disinformation bill We brought you comments from constitutional lawyer Prof Anne Twomey earlier, who has been speaking at a senate inquiry into the government’s misinformation and disinformation bill. Here is some of what she had to say: The opposition transport spokesperson Bridget McKenzie has said her history of criticising the lack of competition in Australian aviation is important to note in the aftermath of revelations she failed to declare 16 flight upgrades over the past nine years. McKenzie, speaking at the Australian Financial Review’s infrastructure summit today, dodged a question about whether her declaration failure had made the public more cynical about politicians in general. However, she sought to make a distinction between her record and Anthony Albanese’s, after recent reports he sought flight upgrades from Qantas when he was transport minister. McKenzie said: I don’t think the public is aware that politicians, MPs, travel business class for work right around the country. Some MPs choose on short trips to fly economy because we see it as a waste of taxpayers money. If you’re simply going from Melbourne to Canberra or Melbourne and Adelaide, why should the taxpayer pay for a business class trip? I think the key issue around this is what is the influence on decision making and I’m very happy to stand by my public comments, my approach to the lack of competition in our aviation sector, the impact that’s had on the Australian travelling public over the influence it may have had, or clearly has had, on other decision makers. I make no bones about the fact that I do believe the former transport minister, our now prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been influenced by his personal and financial relationship with Qantas. Remembrance Day service begins in Canberra A national Remembrance Day service has just begun at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It is beginning with a tri-service guard of honour, with Australia’s Federation Guard marching on to the Parade Ground accompanied by the Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Governor general Sam Mostyn is set to deliver a commemorative address. First national anti-slavery commissioner welcomed: ‘Encouraging on several levels’ The New South Wales anti-slavery commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, has welcomed the appointment of Australia’s first national anti-slavery commissioner, Chris Evans. Cockayne said the appointment was “encouraging on several levels”, with Evans having worked with business leaders, unions, faith leaders, civil society, and researchers. He will combine a deep humanity and care for people with an understanding of how to get things done in Canberra. And his selection is a sign of the seriousness of the Government’s commitment to anti-slavery objectives … I wish him every success and look forward to working with him. Australian Jewish Association received death threat before appearing at misinformation inquiry, president says The Australian Jewish Association’s president, Dr David Adler, has said his organisation received a death threat and was warned not to appear before the committee this morning reviewing the misinformation and disinformation bill. Adler said the AJA, which is opposed to the bill, received the threat over the weekend: I’m not sure how often people who appear before Senate committees are warned not to, and that warning is accompanied by a death threat. But that happened over the weekend. We were sent an illustrated death threat with the hangman’s noose, together with the words that if we appeared before the committee, we would die. And I just think it’s a reflection of the spike in antisemitism that is now at crisis level in Australia. This committee is not about the Middle East conflicts, and there are now people who think that, at the threat of death, we should not participate in Australia’s democratic processes. The committee chair, Labor senator Karen Grogan, said the committee had reported the threat to the Australian federal police and took that action extremely seriously: No one who appears before a committee should ever have to endure those threats, and we will pursue this. Labor and the Coalition are on a unity ticket in wanting under-16s off social media, with the opposition even demanding the government rush the bill through this month without any kind of Senate inquiry – but there’s at least one Liberal senator not on board. Alex Antic, the South Australian conservative, tweeted this morning his claim that “Labor knows that the next generation of young people are being red pilled by social media and are turning away from their bleak world view.” Social media bans for minors and “misinformation” laws will ensure that young Australians only get a corporate left wing message bricking in a new generation of Labor voters. After the government announced its plans to legislate a social media ban for children under 16, and to introduce those laws into parliament this year, the Coalition sought to one-up Labor by calling for the legislation to be passed almost immediately. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who has backed a social media ban for some time, said today he wanted the changes in “before kids go onto Christmas holidays and into the new year, when they’re sitting around on their devices.” Dutton said the laws didn’t need parliamentary examination: We’ve got two sitting weeks left, and I believe that we can pass this law by Christmas. It doesn’t need to be the case that the government’s delaying because they haven’t had a Senate inquiry, or because they’re worried about Meta running a campaign against the government. But Antic’s tweet shows there is some opposition in the Coalition to ramming these laws through. Watch this space. Man’s body found beside highway south of Taree New South Wales police are investigating after a man’s body was found at Johns River, about 36km south of Taree. Police were called to the Pacific Highway at Johns River about 5pm yesterday where officers allegedly found a man deceased on a nature strip behind concrete barriers. He is yet to be formally identified, but is believed to be aged in his 30s. A report will be prepared for the coroner and a crime scene has been established. Police are appealing for witnesses to identify a man reportedly seen walking southbound on the M1 Pacific Motorway between Kew and Johns River on 7 and 10 November. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Melbourne convenience store set alight and rammed with car, police say Victorian detectives will investigate after a car was allegedly rammed into a Pascoe Vale South convenience store this morning and the premises set alight. Emergency services were called to the shop on Coonans Road to reports of the blaze about 3.15am. Police said a family who live in a residence attached to the store were not injured. The area has been cordoned off with a crime scene set up, and it’s expected an arson chemist and detectives will attend the scene today. Police will investigate whether the damage and fire are linked to any other recent incidents. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked legal experts before the senate inquiry on the misinformation and disinformation bill: Who is the arbiter of truth? Constitutional law expert, Prof Anne Twomey says that is a peculiar aspect of the bill, and the platforms tend to outsource to fact checkers, who then turn to experts they can find to speak to an issue, but the responses are often misunderstood: Now I’ve been on the expert side of this, I’ve been asked for many fact checks, and here’s my experience of it. The people that I’m dealing with, they try hard and they’re well meaning, but they are not experts themselves in the field. They’ll ask me a question in a particular form of words. I’ll give them an answer that’s suited to the way they ask me that question, and then sometimes later on, I read what they write and discover that they have misinterpreted or themselves being misleading about it, because they thought the sort of words that they used for me when they asked me the question actually mean the same as another set of words which mean something quite different. The fact checkers often misunderstand the experts, she said, and that isn’t subsequently checked: The impression I get is that these are just frequently, young kids out of university who don’t really know and they’re taking on this really important role of making a decision that will lead some Meta or Google or whatever to make decisions about what is true and what is false when the fact checker themselves hasn’t properly understood what the experts have said, and it’s also really dependent on what experts you choose. The Victorian Bar’s James McCormish says it is the “gaping hole at the heart of the bill”. Almost all workplaces have sexual harassment policies, but many not monitoring prevalence More than 7,000 employers have reported new information to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, following the introduction of the positive duty to provide a safe workplace for all employees as part of the Respect@Work report. While nearly 99% of employers have a formal policy on work-related sexual harassment and discrimination, the new data shows more than one in four employers (28%) are not monitoring how prevalent it is. The WGEA CEO Mary Wooldridge said: While we are seeing comprehensive policy coverage, this is only a critical first step. Long-term culture change within organisations also requires employees and company leaders to know the policy, understand what’s in it and the part they play in its implementation. One of the insights from the Respect@Work report is that proactive engagement by leadership is critical for long-term change. WGEA’s new results show that most CEOs are highly engaged in reviewing, signing off on, and then communicating these policies (85%), however just over half (55%) of their Boards are similarly involved. The data also showed that while there are comprehensive processes to disclose sexual harassment to HR (98%), anonymous disclosure processes are less available (68%). Senate hearing under way into misinformation and disinformation bill A Senate committee is conducting a hearing today on the federal government’s controversial misinformation and disinformation bill, hearing from legal experts, religious groups and federal departments. Constitutional law expert Prof Anne Twomey is up first and tells the committee she is concerned about the definition of disinformation in the bill, arguing that intent to deceive including that someone has been told something is false before is not sufficient: I would imagine in many circumstances, the person is not intending to deceive. In fact, they disagree with what the fact checkers have said and want to put their disagreement out in the public realm and deciding that is disinformation simply on the basis that some fact checker has decided on the basis of one or two experts that something is false, it’s not necessarily false. Just because you’ve checked with some experts, or even if there’s an expert consensus that something is false doesn’t actually mean it really is. People can still believe genuinely what they are saying is true, and I don’t think one should necessarily assume that they are deliberately trying to deceive people, even if they keep disseminating material that other people say is false. Twomey’s point was backed by the Victorian barrister James McCormish. NSW police investigating suspicious death NSW police have launched an investigation after a man’s body was found in the Central West yesterday. About 1.40pm emergency services were called to Parkes after the discovery of the man’s body in a home. He is yet to be formally identified, but is believes to be in his 70s. The death is being treated as suspicious, police said. Officers established a crime scene, a report will be prepared for the coroner and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Dutton’s Remembrance Day statement: ‘May our memory of them hold us to the mark’ The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also issued a statement for Remembrance Day. In a video posted to X, he said: The reason why evil didn’t prevail – why tyranny didn’t crush freedom – is because everyday Australians chose to serve and sacrifice for a greater good. We remember our fallen, so we don’t forget who we are. May our memory of them hold us to the mark. PM issues statement for Remembrance Day Anthony Albanese has released a statement to mark Remembrance Day. Posted to X, the prime minister said “we think of every Australian who has answered the call through the decades”. We think of everywhere they have gone across the world to confront the unimaginable as it became reality .. We remember every name. Every face. Every future lost and every future changed forever. And we think of the many who were cast into the ranks of the unknown soldier as they were torn from life. Transurban CEO: we need to convince drivers of the value of tolls The chief of Transurban, Michelle Jablko, has said the tolling giant needs to do more work to convince drivers of the value they get from taking its paid roads, amid scrutiny on how the company’s tolls affect the New South Wales economy and the cost of living. Jablko’s comments come as her company finds itself in prolonged negotiations with the NSW government about overhauling the contracts for 11 of the state’s 13 toll roads amid deep public dissatisfaction at the rising cost of tolls in Sydney and questions from the business community about how tolls in the city are adding to supply chain costs. Jablko told the Australian Financial Review’s infrastructure summit in Sydney this morning that Transurban was exploring more rewards for customers such as discounts for fuel and car servicing. I hope when customers hear the beep, they go ‘oh, that’s extra value’. A review into NSW’s patchwork toll network commissioned by the Minns Labor government in July recommended a declining distance-based toll to simplify pricing and cheapen commutes to and from Western Sydney, to more equitably spread the city’s estimated $195bn toll burden over the next 37 years. While the government is now hoping to negotiate an overhaul with Transurban, who hold long term contracts for 11 toll roads in Sydney, questions remain about whether the tolling giant will agree to changes that decrease its overall projected revenues, with the government potentially taking legal action to force the changes. Jablko today said that declining distance based tolling, recommended by the review, would actually bring negative effects for the city, because it promotes people to do longer trips and would add to congestion. She also claimed the company’s data showed western Sydney drivers would be worse off, because more commuted locally as opposed to those who drive eastwards to the CBD. We’re heard various warnings about the relative lack of new renewable energy investments in the past year or so – at least if we’re to manage the exit of aging coal-fired power plants and meet our clean energy targets. The September quarter, it turns out, was one of the most promising quarters for some time, the Clean Energy Council reports today. In the July-September months, more than 1,400 megawatts of new wind and solar farms worth $3.3bn reached financial sign-off, the best since the end of 2022. CEC chief Kane Thornton said: If we sustain the level of investment for new wind and solar power plants which we have seen in the third quarter of this year, we can get back on track to achieving Australia’s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030. Most of the new projects were either onshore wind (offshore not actually happening – yet) or big batteries. Rooftop solar has tended to make solar farms a bit less attractive. According to the council, there are 89 renewable electricity generation projects that have either reached financial commitment or are under construction, representing 13.9 gigawatts of capacity in the pipeline. There are also 49 storage projects working their way forward from financial commitment, equivalent to 9.7GW/ 24.3GW-hours in capacity/energy output. While that sounds good, it’s notable that not a lot of capacity has lately come online. The council notes the September quarter saw just three renewable electricity generation projects, totalling 168MW of new capacity, were actually commissioned in Q3 2024. We’ll get the summer readiness report soon from the Australian Energy Market Operator, and it won’t be surprising to hear we may face a few tight spots particularly if there are extended heatwaves and coal-fired plants drop out for unscheduled reasons. Breaker Rachael Gunn, better known as Raygun, has said she is not retiring from breaking despite reports suggesting she would. Last week she told 2DayFm she was “going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems a really difficult thing for me to do now, to approach a battle”, due to the scrutiny she received after her performance at the Paris Olympics. Speaking on the Today Show this morning, Gunn said she never used the word retire and that her comments had been misinterpreted: I was talking on 2DayFm about how I’m not going to do certain competitions anymore – which didn’t seem like such a big deal because breaking is not going to be in the Olympics anyway. But you know, I’m still going to be part of community jams … and still dance and still break. [I never used] the word retire, but, you know, it just caught on to the news cycle … I’m not retiring. Her comments also come after she made a cameo appearance at Tones and I’s show at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday, brought on stage to perform during Dance With Me. Full Story podcast: Students are drowning in debt. Will Labor’s plan help them? Last week the prime minister delivered a pitch to young Australians: Labor will slash their student debt by 20% next financial year if the Albanese government is re-elected. The surprise announcement is part of a major federal government overhaul designed to boost access to education and address ‘intergenerational unfairness’. But while the move has been welcomed by many, it has also been widely criticised for not doing enough to help students as well as unfairly penalising all taxpayers. Chief economist at the Australia Institute and Guardian columnist Greg Jericho gives his take on why Labor’s plan isn’t perfect but why the feigned outrage over ‘fairness’ is wrong. You can have a listen below: Central Australia is set to face a concentration of showers and thunderstorms, with south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales facing “an almost daily thunderstorm risk at the moment”. Senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology spoke with the Today show earlier and provided a forecast update: Today we’re going to see the concentration of showers and thunderstorms through central parts of the country, largely impacting South Australia and southern parts of the Northern Territory, as well as southeast Queensland and northeast NSW, which are seeing an almost daily thunderstorm risk at the moment … [This could bring] heavy rainfall that could lead to flash flooding, large hail or damaging winds. She said in recent days, heatwave conditions had been contracting away from southern Queensland and is less extensive than it was over the weekend. Even where we don’t have those heatwave warnings, we’re continuing to see very hot weather across the northern parts of Australia, with temperatures 2 to 5 degrees above average – which for many areas, particularly inland, equates to temperatures in the high 30s at least, if not the low to mid 40s. Naplan scores remained stable amid Covid school closures: new study New research from UNSW and the University of Sydney suggests that Naplan scored remained stable during Covid-related school closures, while other countries reported learning losses. The research, published earlier this year, analysed Naplan test scores across Australian states – comparing differences in student performance based on varying periods of remote learning between 2020 and 2021, with school closures ranging from nine days to 157 days. Dr Nalini Prasad said students in schools that operated remotely for an extended time “performed similarly to students in schools which were closed for a relatively short period”. Australia adopted a zero-Covid policy which used lockdowns – and other non-pharmaceutical interventions –pre-emptively to eliminate the transmission of Covid-19. Per capita Covid case numbers and deaths were considerably lower in Australia. Low Covid case numbers meant that students did not have to miss school due to contracting the virus. Researchers used Naplan test scores from 2013-2019 as baseline data, comparing them with scores from 2021 and 2022. The data also suggested remote attendance rates were comparable to, and sometimes exceeded, typical in-person schooling levels. Matt Keogh on Aukus, second Trump presidency Matt Keogh was also questioned on what he thinks the challenges will be for the Australian government amid a second Trump presidency? He pointed to comments from treasurer Jim Chalmers and noted there would be “some economic bumps on the road that will be effecting not just Australia but the globe.” Keogh said the government is prepared to weather this “through flexible interest rates”, adding: We understand regardless of who is in charge of the White House or what is happening across the globe, what matters to Australians is being able to make ends meet themselves. He also expressed confidence in the Aukus deal under Trump, telling the program that legislation went through Congress recently with a “broad cross-section of support.” We expect that to continue even under a Trump Presidency. Veteran’s affairs minister on progress of oversight body The minister for veterans’ affairs and defence personnel, Matt Keogh, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier to mark Remembrance Day. Asked how soon an independent oversight body will be set up to examine government progress in implementing the recommendations of the royal commission into veteran suicides, he said: We only received that report in September. 122 recommendations are backed up by seven volumes and 3,100 pages of report. There is quite a bit of detail there, but we understand the importance and urgency of this work and that is why we have committed to responding by the end of the year. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Executives from the supermarket giant Aldi are set to be questioned on the state of the sector, AAP reports, as the consumer watchdog examines rising prices at the checkout. Aldi officials will be questioned by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over the next two days as part of its latest round of hearings into supermarkets. While Coles and Woolworths have come under fire for their market share and accusations of price gouging, Aldi is the next largest player in the grocery industry. Aldi holds just 9% of supermarket sales nationally, compared to the 67% market share of Coles and Woolworths. The consumer watchdog previously said it had taken two decades for Aldi to reach a 9% market share, indicating there were issues with competition in the supermarket industry. This demonstrates the level of difficulty entering and expanding in supermarket retailing, and the significant investment, time and differentiated offering required to expand. Officials for Coles, Woolworths and Metcash – the parent company of IGA – will also front the commission’s inquiry in coming days. The hearings into supermarkets are being held ahead of a final report being delivered to the federal government in February. Conroy on tensions between the US and China Pat Conroy was also asked about increasing tensions between the US and China over a number of issues, including tariffs and Taiwan, under Trump – and what Australia is doing to prepare for this. He told ABC RN the government had been “very honest with the Australian public that we live in an era of geopolitical competition in Indo-Pacific”. Prime minister [Anthony] Albanese made a series of announcements with President [Joe] Biden around critical minerals, and we would expect the United States to continue to focus on that area. Obviously, President [Donald] Trump and his administration will have their own approach, but it’s been very clear that a lot of countries have been overly reliant on one supply source, and there’s going to be a real focus on supply chain resilience and sovereignty across the world. That’s why we’re investing in making missiles in this country, that’s why we’re investing in a future made in Australia. Pat Conroy confident of Aukus deal’s future amid Trump administration The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, is speaking with ABC RN about the Aukus agreement – and how safe he believes this is under a Donald Trump administration in the US. Conry said he was very confident, with the plan being “in the strategic interests of all three countries involved” and “strong bipartisan support in the United States.” Conroy was also asked about news that former secretary of state Mike Pompeo won’t be part of the administration. As the host noted, Pompeo was a strong supporter of Aukus, and Richard Marles and Penny Wong had met with him in recent months to discuss the future of the deal under a potential Trump administration. Asked if this is a blow to Aukus, Conroy responded: No, I don’t believe so. Ministers of the Australian government have been engaging with Republican opinion leaders for a number of years, just as we engage with Democratic [leaders], so I’m confident that the strong … United States [support] for Aukus will continue … because it’s in the US interest. Conroy was also asked about calls from Labor luminaries, such as former premier Bob Carr, for the deal to be reconsidered amid the Trump victory. Conroy said he respects their opinions but “the will of the party was clearly expressed at the national conference, where a very strong majority supported Aukus”. Media watchdog to call for new powers to fight misinformation on social media The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) will today reiterate its call for more powers to combat misinformation and disinformation on social media. The communications watchdog believes a code of practice on misinformation and disinformation – which has been signed by Adobe, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Redbubble, TikTok, Twitch and Legitimate – lacks enforcement power. In a submission to a senate committee, Acma warned: There is no regulatory backstop to either compel digital platforms to become signatories or hold them accountable if they breach their obligations. Acma will appear before the parliamentary inquiry today and continue its call for tougher legislation: To be both effective and enforceable, the code must be supported by key performance indicators linked to code commitments and measurable through high-quality sets of Australian-relevant data. This is essential to hold signatories accountable to their commitments and provide transparency to Australians on the effectiveness of these measures. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has flagged his election campaign will focus on cost of living and migration, linking the latter to the release of 224 unlawful non-citizens who had been in indefinite detention. In a press conference yesterday, Dutton was asked if the Coalition would mirror Donald Trump’s successful election campaign in the US. Dutton responded the opposition would run its “own campaign” but flagged some of the issues in the US, such as “migration”, were a focus in Australia too. The opposition leader turned to the release of hundreds of immigration detainees, known as the NZYQ cohort, following a high court decision in November 2023 that indefinite detention is unlawful. Dutton inaccurately claimed the Albanese government had a choice in their release, and described the entire cohort as “hardened criminals”. Certainly cost of living, certainly interest rates, certainly migration because the government has released over 200 hardened criminals from immigration detention when they didn’t need to do so ... so our country is less safe as a result of the decisions that the Albanese government’s made and we are poorer as a community as well. I think they’re the issues that really will be front of mind for Australians at the next election. While a number of the non-citizens within the cohort have had serious criminal convictions, some have had their visas cancelled for fraud, “other non-violent offences”, or lower level offences, such as common assaults. In response to the high court’s ruling last November, Labor and the Coalition passed changes imposing strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and curfews, to those released. Last week, the high court again ruled against the government’s powers, saying it breached the separation of powers. The judges said the conditions were “a form of extra-judicial collective punishment based on membership of the class”. The following day, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, made new regulations to regain the power to impose the conditions where someone “poses a substantial risk of seriously harming any part of the Australian community by committing a serious offence”. Australians will pause for a minute of silence at 11am to honour the thousands who died in military conflicts in commemoration services around the nation. As AAP reports, a national service will take place at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where the governor general, Sam Mostyn, will deliver a commemorative address. After the commemoration, Anthony Albanese and Mostyn will make an announcement about a military honour. In Sydney, a service at the Martin Place Cenotaph will begin at 10.30am, while the Opera House will be illuminated with images of poppies at dawn and dusk. RSL Queensland said more than 140 events would take place at sub-branches state-wide, with its official Queensland service taking place at Brisbane’s Anzac Square from 10.15am. RSL Western Australia will use the occasion to call for DNA donations to try to help identify unnamed fallen soldiers from the 32nd Battalion that took part in one of World War I’s most devastating battles in July 1916. RSL WA’s official service will be held at the State War Memorial in Kings Park. The Greens will announce its $74bn plan to wipe all student debt as it looks to snatch a seat off Labor in inner-city Melbourne. The minor party will reveal the proposal in Wills, held by Labor’s Peter Khalil, with their candidate, Samantha Ratnam, who led the party in Victoria for nearly seven years. Costings from the Parliamentary Budget Office show the policy to wipe all student debt would cost $55bn over the next four years and $74bn over the decade. The Greens estimate this will save someone with a debt of $27,600 about $5,500 a year. The Greens’ education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, said the policy would make a “real, tangible difference to so many people doing it tough”. Student debt can’t be fixed because student debt shouldn’t exist. All student debt should be wiped. If Anthony Albanese can go to uni for free, so should everyone else. It comes as Labor announced last week it would slash Hecs debts by 20% if it wins at the next federal election. The Greens say they would pass any bill to reduce student debts in this term if Labor were to bring the proposal forward. Good morning and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I’m Emily Wind and I’ll be taking you through our live coverage this Monday. Today, the Greens are set to announce its $74bn plan to wipe all student debt as it looks to snatch a seat off Labor in inner-city Melbourne. The minor party will reveal the proposal in Wills, held by Labor’s Peter Khalil, with their candidate Samantha Ratnam, who led the party in Victoria for nearly seven years. Sarah Basford Canales will have all the details soon. Meanwhile, Australians will pause to honour the thousands who died in military conflicts in commemoration services around the nation. As AAP reports, a national service will take place at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where governor general Sam Mostyn will deliver a commemorative address. After the commemoration, Anthony Albanese and Mostyn will make an announcement about a military honour. We’ll bring you more details soon.

                    "bodyText": "Apple’s upgraded MacBook Pro for 2024 gets a significant power boost with the M4 chip, double the memory as standard, even longer battery life and a price cut, ending the year on a high. The longstanding laptop line now starts at £1,599 (€1,899/$1,599/A$2,499), making it £100 or so cheaper than last year’s M3 models. Though still an expensive, premium laptop, it comes with at least 16GB of RAM rather than 8GB, which was an upgrade worth paying extra for on previous models. The outside hasn’t changed from its predecessor. The body is still a solid, premium-feeling aluminium shell that looks great in either grey or black. It isn’t a super-thin machine but the 14.2in size is easy to fit into a bag without feeling too cramped for work on the go. The screen is still the star of the show: a super bright and crisp mini LED display with a 120Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth. It is noticeably brighter than many rivals for general work and really shines with HDR content. Apple now sells a special nano-texture display option for £150 more that significantly reduces glare for working in bright light or outdoors if needed. The webcam above the screen has seen a very welcome upgrade to a 12MP Stage Centre camera, similar to those used in most iPads since 2021. It automatically pans and scans to keep you in the frame, which is a killer feature for anyone who lives on video calls for their work. It has a novel “Desk View” option that uses the ultrawide-angle lens to show the space directly in front of the laptop for demonstrating things remotely. It isn’t the clearest of views with the integrated camera, but it is easier trying to use use an iPhone as a secondary camera with various accessories. The camera still doesn’t support Apple’s Face ID system from the iPhone and iPad, which is a shame even though the Touch ID fingerprint sensor in the power button works great. Specifications Screen: 14.2in mini LED (3024x1964; 254 ppi) ProMotion (120Hz) Processor: Apple M4, Pro or Max RAM: 16, 24, 32 or up to 128GB Storage: 512GB, 1, 2, 4 or 8TB SSD Operating system: macOS 15.1 Sequoia Camera: 12MP Centre Stage Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 3x Thunderbolt 4/USB 4, HDMI 2.1, SD card, headphones Dimensions: 221.2 x 312.6 x 15.5mm Weight: 1.55kg Rapid M4 power with very long battery life Inside, the big upgrade is the addition of Apple’s latest M4 series of chips, first seen in the iPad Pro M4 from earlier in the year. The base-model 14in MacBook Pro now starts with a 10-core version of the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM – double that of its predecessor – which is a welcome upgrade. The M4 chip is up to 25% faster across the board than the outgoing M3 chip and up to 1.8 times as fast as the original M1 chip, making it very fast indeed. In day-to-day usage it felt extremely rapid, with launching apps and crunching data noticeably faster than on a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip from 2021. The laptop has class-leading battery life, lasting about 21 hours of light browsing and regularly managing about 18 hours of work with lots of tabs open in Chrome, a word processor, plus various small utilities, note-taking and messaging apps, and some light photo editing in Affinity Photo. It also has excellent standby battery life, losing only about 1% overnight while closed. For many use cases the M4 chip will be more than enough. But for those looking to render 3D objects, crunch numbers or author code, M4 Pro and M4 Max chips are available that add more high-performance processing and graphics cores plus Thunderbolt 5 connectivity. The base-model M4 laptop gains an additional Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 port compared with its predecessor and is capable of driving two external monitors and the laptop display at once. Sustainability The MacBook Pro is made of 35% recycled materials, including aluminium, copper, gold, plastic, rare earth elements, steel and tin. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact in its report. The laptop is generally repairable and Apple makes repair manuals available. The battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles and can be replaced for £245 by Apple. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. MacOS Sequoia and the first of Apple Intelligence The MacBook Pro runs the latest version of macOS Sequoia 15.1, which ships with a variety of new messages and other features in line with iOS 18.1. It has a very useful new window tiling system, which snaps windows to the sides or full screen when you drag them to the edges of the display, similar to the feature on Windows 11. It has iPhone mirroring, which allows you to wirelessly see a virtual representation of your iPhone on your Mac and control it with your mouse and keyboard, including using apps. Your choice of notifications from your phone show up in the Mac’s notification centre, which is handy for certain services that only have phone apps. But it is the first handful of features of Apple Intelligence that are the highest-profile new additions. These include the same AI writing tools capable of proofing, rewriting and summarising your text as seen on an iPhone or iPad. Because they’re built straight into the operating system, they are easier and faster to use than third-party options, but I only found them useful a handful of times. You can now type to talk to the new Siri, which works very well on a Mac. Double tap the Command button to bring up a text box to ask your query rather than via voice, which is far more socially acceptable in an office or coffee shop. Siri is still far behind rivals such as Google’s Gemini in capability, however. Other small AI tools are dotted around various apps. The Photos app now has natural language search and a new AI Clean Up tool for deleting unwanted objects. The Mail and Messages apps have AI smart replies and summaries of conversations, while notifications from all apps can be stacked and summarised for quick parsing. None of these tools feel like a killer feature on the Mac, but some of them can be useful in a pinch and generally don’t get in the way if not. Price The 14in MacBook Pro M4 starts at £1,599 (€1,899/$1,599/A$2,499). M4 Pro models start at £1,999 (€2,399/$1,999/A$3,299) and M4 Max at £3,199 (€3,799/$3,199/A$4,999). For comparison, the MacBook Air M3 costs from £1,099, the iPad Pro M4 costs £999, the equivalent Dell XPS 14 costs about £1,400, the Razer Blade 14 costs £2,150 and Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio 2 costs from £2,069. Verdict The MacBook Pro M4 shows that small improvements across the board do slowly add up to much bigger things. It may not look all that different to last year’s M3 model, but it delivers a meaningful upgrade to speed and battery life and when compared with only a three-year-old machine it makes a huge difference in day-to-day operation. The 14in laptop is still the sweet spot for screen size and portability, aided by Apple’s best-in-class keyboard, trackpad and fantastic display. Finally bringing the excellent Centre Stage camera to the MacBook Pro is a very welcome upgrade, even if it doesn’t bring with it Face ID. The extra USB-C port, double the starting memory and the sheer speed of the M4 chip make the starting model much more appealing, too. It is still an expensive laptop, but as a premium workstation that can be used at full speed away from a power socket and lasts a very long time on battery, nothing really comes close unless you specifically need Windows 11. Pros: M4 chip is rapid with choice for more power available, 16GB RAM minimum, very long battery life, fantastic miniLED ProMotion screen, great Centre Stage camera, plenty of ports and SD card slot, brilliant speakers, Touch ID, great keyboard and trackpad. Cons: no Face ID, no USB-A, RAM or SSD cannot be upgraded after purchase, expensive, not a big upgrade on M3 model."

                    "bodyText": "The first piece of AI-generated video I ever made moved me to tears – tears of laughter. Given the chance to fool around with Runway AI’s Gen-3 Alpha, I dropped in an image of an eagle carrying off a wolf. Moments later, the picture sprang into life. The eagle slowly flapped its wings as it glided down a mountainside, dropping the wolf from its talons. Except the bird only had one leg – and its plummeting prey sprouted wings from its tail and morphed into a wolf-headed goose. It was weird and hilarious. Make no mistake, though – this is the future. Generative AI has given us amusingly surreal images such as the pope in a puffer jacket and a 90s nightclub where everyone is Gordon Ramsay, but the entertainment industry is not laughing. In fact, it’s panicking. A recent statement opposing “the unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI” has been signed by more than 25,000 writers, actors and musicians, including Julianne Moore, Kazuo Ishiguro and Thom Yorke. It’s not just performers; AI threatens massive upheaval to people who make our movies, television shows and video games. A report published in January predicted generative AI would disrupt more than 200,000 entertainment industry jobs in the US by 2026, and 75% of respondents believed the technology would lead to job losses in their area. One visual effects (VFX) executive describes the situation to me as “like King Canute trying to turn back the waves. It’s out of the box and it’s never going back in again.” Things are moving rapidly. This February Open AI, the creators of ChatGPT, unveiled Sora, their astoundingly sophisticated text-to-video tool. In response, actor and film-maker Tyler Perry immediately cancelled an $800m studio expansion he was planning in Atlanta. “I don’t have to put a set on my lot,” he said. “I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.” Last month, Runway AI announced it was partnering with Lionsgate Studios, makers of the Hunger Games and John Wick movies, to develop “cutting edge, capital efficient, content creation opportunities”. Sony has also said it will use AI to “produce both films for theatres and television in a more efficient way”. New video-generation rivals are springing up: Meta’s Movie Gen, Luma AI’s Dream Machine, Adobe’s Firefly, China’s Kling AI. And if any further harbinger were needed, in September James Cameron joined the board of Stability AI, creators of market leader Stable Video Diffusion. Cameron laid out the AI worst-case scenario 40 years ago in The Terminator, but now he’s learned to love it. “I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push what’s possible,” he said. “The intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave.” Now that wave is threatening to flood an unprepared industry, washing away jobs and certainties. How do people in the industry feel? To find out, I attended Trojan Horse Was a Unicorn (THU), a digital arts festival near Lisbon in Portugal. Now in its 10th year, THU is a place where young artists entering these industries, some 750 of them, come to meet, get inspired and learn from veterans in their fields: film-makers, animators, VFX wizards, concept artists, games designers. This year, AI is the elephant in the room. Everyone is either talking about it – or avoiding talking about it. “Art should be created by humans,” says João, a Portuguese games designer in his early 20s, as he doodles in a sketchbook (despite being in digital arts, most people here still draw, paint and sculpt). “Every brushstroke comes from experience, from hardship. AI takes out the curiosity, the learning.” “It makes things faster, but I think it’s more dangerous than useful,” says Rosa, a Spanish concept artist sitting next to him, as she draws in her own sketchbook. “Bottom line: it’s stealing our work and it’s taking our jobs.” “I’ve only been in this industry for three years and I’ve already lost two jobs to AI,” agrees another round the table. Before, she was doing illustrations for games concepts, she explains, but thanks to AI, “the CEO decided, ‘I can do this on my own now, we don’t need you.’” Up-and-coming artists used to start out with work like this, illustrating pitches for new projects to studios. But as another young artist tells me, “Pitch work is dead. They’re not hiring artists to do that any more. They’re going to generative AI.” The games industry laid off more than 10,000 people in 2023, and this year’s cull is reportedly higher. Companies have already been using AI for “five or six” years, an insider tells me. Activision Blizzard, the Microsoft-owned makers of games such as Call of Duty and Candy Crush, has already laid off 1,900 workers this year. In January, Riot Games, makers of League of Legends, laid off 11% of its global staff. It’s a similar story in Hollywood, which is increasingly digital in terms of big-budget animations and special effects-driven movies. Now the industry is looking battered by declining cinema attendances and expensive but poorly performing movies – compounded by last year’s actors strike, which was partly over AI. Hence the talk of “efficiency”. “It can do things that used to take two weeks in less than a day,” says the VFX executive, who did not wish to be named. An ever expanding array of AI-powered tools are now at film-makers’ disposal and they are irresistibly powerful: “We were taking just pencil sketch outlines, and [using AI] you can make them look 3D, so you get rid of the need for a modeller to sculpt something for you. It is frightening.” People like him are in an impossible position, he says: “I’m making my own obsolescence, because if I don’t use it, I’m obsolete; if I do use it, I sort of functionally bring an end to myself as well.” Some artists at THU are taking on the AI companies directly, like Karla Ortiz, a fine artist who also does concept art for high-end movies. Her work shaped the look of Marvel’s Doctor Strange, for example – the character, the costumes, the hair, the mannerisms, even, arguably, the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch. Going one step further than the statement by Julianne Moore and co, in January 2023, Ortiz co-launched a class action lawsuit against a group of AI companies including Stability AI, claiming they “violate the rights of millions of artists” by training their models on artists’ copyrighted work – without their knowledge or consent. Ortiz, who is Puerto Rican-born and San Francisco-based, first stumbled across AI-generated art online in early 2022. Having dug into the training datasets, she believes these companies assimilated the work of every artist she could think of, including herself: “I found almost the entirety of my fine artwork in there, and I knew that’s what powered these models.” None of the artists were informed, consulted or compensated. “My paintings aren’t just copyrighted – they’re my life,” says Ortiz. “This feels like identity theft.” She believes a more ethical form of AI is both possible and necessary, but even she acknowledges that it will be difficult to put this genie back in the bottle. “Once the models are trained, they can never forget. Un-learning is not a thing … A lot of people say, ‘Well, it’s out there, adapt.’ Here’s how I adapt: I’m gonna sue the living pants out of them.” Stability AI and the other defendants have successfully dismissed aspects of the class action, but legally this is uncharted waters, and the lawsuit is now proceeding to discovery, which means Ortiz’s side will get to see internal communications within these AI companies, with a view to eventually going to trial. A victory could have enormous repercussions. “I think we have enough to totally win,” Ortiz says. From the AI companies’ point of view, rather than destroying the creative industries, they are saving them. “The cost of making content has skyrocketed,” explains Cristobál Valenzuela, co-founder of Runway AI, speaking over videocall from the US. “People are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make films, and that’s not sustainable long term, because the market needs more content. So something needs to happen. And for us, this is the moment where technology can come and help drive the cost of production down.” Born in Chile, 35-year-old Valenzuela studied economics, taught himself software engineering then came to art school in New York, where he and two friends founded Runway in 2018. “We’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of AI and art,” he says. Since 2022 the company has held an annual AI film festival in Los Angeles and New York. Despite my disastrous wolf-eagle experiment, Runway’s AI is already being used in film and music videos, including the Oscar-winning Everything Everywhere All at Once. What data Runway trains its models on is “confidential”, Valenzuela says, but their deal with Lionsgate avoids at least some of the copyright issues raised by Ortiz, since it is using the studio’s own back catalogue. “If you have content in one particular style, the model can better assess and understand that style, and so help you generate in that particular direction.” That doesn’t mean you’ll be able to make a movie just by typing in, say, “John Wick 17”, but it will make it easier, he says. “There’s a lot of fires and explosions and CGI in those movies, right? Well, blowing up cars is really expensive.” Even blowing up a CGI car “needs hundreds of hours of time and work. Wouldn’t it be great if we have a system that does it better and faster?” He says AI “will free you from much of the tedious, repetitive day-to-day work. That’s great. We should celebrate that.” This doesn’t necessarily mean a reduction in personnel, reckons Valenzuela: “I actually think we’ll see the opposite. If the cost of making stuff goes down, then you will start hiring more people, because now you can make more projects.” Some jobs will disappear, he argues, but new ones will be created. “We used to employ people in elevators to press the buttons, or people to throw rocks at your window before alarm clocks were invented.” He thinks “Will AI replace humans?” is the wrong question. “It’s software, it’s a computer, it’s technology, but a pen is technology. And so it would be strange for us to position an argument like, ‘Do you prefer humans or pens?’” Veterans of the industry have seen this kind of technological upheaval before. When CGI movies such as Toy Story arrived, old-school animators felt they had become obsolete. Many left the profession, but others adapted and learned new skills. As one industry pro at THU points out, CGI actually grew animation: a traditional hand-drawn animated feature required about 120 artists; last year’s Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse employed about 400. What’s his AI advice to THU’s young artists? “Before we get fucked by it, we have to make it ours.” Andre Luis, the 43-year-old CEO and co-founder of THU, acknowledges that “the anxiety is here” at this year’s event, but rather than running away from it, he argues, artists should be embracing it. One of the problems now is that the people eagerly adopting AI are executives and managers. “They don’t understand how to use AI to accelerate creativity,” he says, “or to make things better for everyone, so it’s up to us [the artists] to teach them. You need people who actually are creative to use AI.” Luis likens generative AI to ultra processed food: it cannot create anything new; it can only reconstitute what’s already there, turning it into an inferior product. “And a lot of companies are trying to make fast food,” he says. Many see AI as a way to churn out quick, cheap content, as opposed to higher quality fare that has been created “organically” over time, with loving human input. In addition to Ortiz’s lawsuit potentially cutting off the supply, the public doesn’t like AI-generated content, and nor do the artists working in these industries – many of whom feel like trained chefs being made to flip burgers. “There are a lot of people quitting these companies trying to do AI fast food,” says Luis. “They are searching their own paths in a different way, and I think they are right.” He sees THU as part of that; beyond the festival, it is also a year-round platform for creatives to connect and collaborate. The democratising potential of AI could usher in what Luis calls “a new era of indie” in films, games, TV. Just as digital technology put cameras, editing and graphics tools into the hands of many more people. “AI will allow a lot of young kids that never had the budget to implement their ideas, to do incredible stuff,” he says. “Instead of being scared of AI, a lot of young creators are thinking, ‘My dreams are now possible. I don’t need $100m to do this – I can do it with $2m.’ Instead of one organisation with 500 employees, you’ll have 100 organisations with five employees.” As happened with cinema in the 90s, “the major studios will start buying content from the indies,” Luis predicts. This might not be good news for entertainment corporations, but it could be great news for audiences, creators, and art itself. What’s important, says Luis, is not the bottom line but culture and the impact it has on people, to enrich society. “AI is something that is here,” he tells the young creators at THU, “so you need to adapt. See the opportunities, see the problems, but understand that it can help you do things in a different way. You need to ask yourselves, ‘How can I be part of that?’”"

                    "bodyText": "Meta announced Monday that it would allow US national security agencies and defense contractors to use its open-source artificial intelligence model, Llama. The announcement came days after Reuters reported an older version of Llama had been used by researchers to develop defense applications for the military wing of the Chinese government. Meta’s policies typically prohibit the use of its open-source large language model for “military, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, [and] espionage”. The company is making an exception for US agencies and contractors as well as similar national security agencies in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, according to Bloomberg. “These kinds of responsible and ethical uses of open source AI models like Llama will not only support the prosperity and security of the United States, they will also help establish US open-source standards in the global race for AI leadership,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post. Among the government contractors Meta is opening up Llama to are Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI and Snowflake. The company emphasized the need to develop AI that is more advanced than that of China – a key talking point that many members of the US Congress bring up when discussing whether and how to regulate AI. “In a world where national security is inextricably linked with economic output, innovation and job growth, widespread adoption of American open-source AI models serves both economic and security interests,” Clegg wrote. “Other nations – including China and other competitors of the United States – understand this as well, and are racing to develop their own open-source models, investing heavily to leap ahead of the US.” Two Chinese researchers associated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were able to access and use an older version of Llama to develop a chatbot that helped to gather and process military intelligence, according to Reuters. The researcher’s use of Llama was “unauthorized”, according to a statement Meta provided Reuters. US regulators have repeatedly expressed their desires to beat other countries, namely China, to developing the most advanced AI for national security reasons. Last week, the White House published its first memo on how the federal government plans to address AI national security policy. Among the priorities the White House listed was the need to “harness AI to achieve national security objectives” and accelerate the procurement of AI capabilities from the private sector. “Advances at the frontier of AI will have significant implications for national security and foreign policy in the near future,” the memo reads. The tech industry has long supplied AI technology to US and international defense and national security agencies. In 2018, Google workers successfully opposed the company’s participation in a Pentagon project, called Project Maven, that uses AI to better decipher drone videos. Tech workers have protested these defense contracts with more fervor in the last year, particularly as many questioned their employer’s work with the Israeli government. However, with the government demand for AI models sky-rocketing, tech firms are likely to be more motivated than ever to bid for these national security contracts."

                    "bodyText": "Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, technology news editor at Guardian US. Today in the newsletter: X’s final form, learnings from a packed week of earnings, and niche online Halloween costumes. Thank you for joining me. With the US election, X’s transformation into Elon Musk’s weapon reaches its peak. He has succeeded in bending his social network to his will. Last week, Musk deputized his followers to report any “potential instances of voter fraud and irregularities”, tweeting about and linking to a forum within X called the “election integrity community”. Experts told my colleague Johana Bhuiyan that the community, which has more than 50,000 members, resembled 2020’s Stop the Steal Facebook group with its conspiratorial tenor and morass of uncorrected misinformation. Users posting on the self-contained feed quickly began pointing out what they deemed evidence of fraud and election interference. Tweets showing everything from ballots that arrived ripped, an ABC News system test, and a postal worker doing his job and dropping off mail-in ballots were all presented as evidence that the presidential election had been compromised. Among the tweets are attempts at doxing and identifying people who users falsely accuse of ballot-box stuffing or preventing Trump supporters from voting. Before anyone can determine whether the claims are true or false, users seize on the posts and assume the often unsuspecting person being shown is guilty. Musk is weaponizing X’s features. He’s bending the posts of others to his political will, curating the discussion into an alternative reality. He’s favoring the posts of some while hiding those of others: the Washington Post reported last week that, of the 100 top-tweeting congressional accounts, only Republicans are going viral. When he first bought Twitter, Musk deployed Twitter’s internal documents to reshape its public image with the Twitter Files. Then, when he endorsed Donald Trump, he made his own account his spear. He bombarded his followers with pro-Trump messages and a glitchy Trump interview on Twitter Spaces. We’ve never seen a transformation like X’s: a billionaire unafraid of campaigning and naked partisanship bending a connective network used by tens of millions to his vision of reality. Elon Musk was the October surprise. In the absence of financial success with his forced purchase, Musk has turned to politics to make his $44bn bet pay off. As my colleague Dan Milmo put it: “X’s continued influence as a news source and its role as an outlet for broadcasting its owner’s rightwing views to his 200 million-plus followers, means the benefit to the world’s richest person does not need to be measured in financial benchmarks alone.” Think of the restoration of Trump’s account and all Musk’s pro-Trump tweets as in-kind contributions, which Musk will cash in on during a Trump presidency. When the election ends – will it ever end? – X’s value will decrease. It will become less important that the world’s richest man is yammering about voter fraud conspiracies. X’s traffic will probably fall off, as it does for media outlets that see surges of interest in political contests and corresponding craters. We will see the effects of Musk’s weaponization in the clear light of day. Learnings from earnings Five of the Magnificent Seven – Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Apple – reported their quarterly earnings last week. All beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations, though not all stocks went up. From their stellar performances, we can glean a few lessons. 1. Ads are still the lifeblood of the internet’s economy Google earnings, Meta earnings and even Amazon earnings show that digital ads can still sustain an empire. 2. Investment in AI is paying off, particularly for the cloud business Bully for Google, Microsoft and Amazon! All three, as well as Meta, have increased their capital expenditures by tens of billions to pay for their artificial intelligence products, but investors seem to think it’s worth it. Each reported strong growth in its cloud business. Meta’s investment in open-source AI has likewise led it to claim the title of Most Used AI as it inserts Meta AI into Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Investors loved that. 3. Both of these upshots benefit one company in particular Reddit, which turned a profit for the first time as a public company last week, saw a whopping 68% revenue increase compared with the same quarter last year. The company makes most of its money from advertising, so a robust market means Reddit earns more money even as a smaller player than Google and Meta. Reddit’s ad revenue is up 56%. Reddit chief Steve Huffman also attributed the company’s above-expected performance to a newer revenue stream: deals with AI companies. Everybody who wants to build a large language model that generates English text uses Reddit to train that AI. That social network is a vast and well-organized corpus of text written by human beings. Reddit licenses that dataset to Google, OpenAI and others for tens of millions of dollars. That source of cash might not last for ever, but it’s not going away any time soon. Reddit, in turn, is benefiting from AI. Monthly users of the social network rose by half in this quarter alone to an astounding 97 million. Huffman attributed the dramatic rise to the social network’s new translation feature, which uses AI to rewrite English posts in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German. The company plans to expand the feature in the coming months. New York magazine’s John Herrman points out that Reddit, as a repository of human-written material, is also the beneficiary of people who want to be sure what they’re reading was not written by AI. As such, Reddit has become “Google’s favorite website”, Herrman writes, a throne that comes with its own sword of Damocles. Huffman said Reddit had become Google’s sixth-most searched word. Many digital media outlets have reached the same lofty place only to fall back to earth with a crash. This week on my iPhone Niche Halloween costumes got the meme treatment with the proliferation of jokes beginning with “I hate gay Halloween … ” on X and Instagram. The meme seems to point to something greater: online culture has reached a point of not only debating the appeal of an individual specific reference – NeNe Leakes and a white refrigerator, for instance – but also arguing about the worthiness of taking the internet’s inside jokes IRL. Is it worth wearing a bulky cardboard box all night as you yell: “It’s from an early season of The Real Housewives!”? There’s a bit of self-loathing involved in starting your own tweet of your costume with “I hate”. I predict next year we’ll see more witches and cats. Perhaps not, though. A rebuttal from X in the name of joy: “i love everybody’s niche halloween costumes!! i love the specificity I love the creativity i love when you put a lot of time and effort into something that is quite literally just to make yourself laugh and i genuinely love when i don’t understand it and have to have it explained.” For my part, I dressed as a skeleton for the third year in a row. The wider Techscape “I am the infamous non-responder in our group chat” – does that make someone a bad friend? Meta and Amazon’s ambitions to expand their data center operations with nuclear power hit roadblocks this week. Meta was foiled by rare bees, Amazon by a standard unfavorable commission vote. OpenAI launched ChatGPT search. How to: is your smartphone being tracked? Here’s how to tell. And is your air fryer spying on you? The everyday items that are stuffed with trackers. Lol: Russia fined YouTube $20 decillion, more than the gross domestic product of the entire world."

                    "bodyText": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple’s latest superphone, with a massive screen, the fastest chip and the most advanced cameras on an iPhone, ready to be your entertainment powerhouse, if you can squeeze it into a pocket or bag. This enormous iPhone comes at an equally huge price. Starting at £1,199 (€1,449/$1,199/A$2,149) the 16 Pro Max tops the iPhone 16 series, towering above the £999 16 Pro and £899 16 Plus, though, at least it comes with double the starting storage of the rest. Unlike their predecessors, the 16 Pro and Pro Max have matching cameras, chips and capabilities, providing a choice of size between a relatively compact 6.3in screen and the biggest ever fitted to an Apple phone. The 16 Pro Max’s 6.9in screen is 0.2in bigger on the diagonal than the outgoing 15 Pro Max, which makes it one of the largest on the market, outstretching Samsung and Google’s superphones. The display looks fantastic: bright, crisp and slick, with its 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. For widescreen video the visible display is only 10% (18mm) shorter than the iPad mini, so it feels more like watching films on a small tablet than a phone. Thinner bezels around the screen have soaked up some of the display’s increase in size but the 16 Pro Max is 6g heavier, 3.1mm longer and 1mm wider than its predecessor. That makes it a full 13.4mm taller, 6.1mm wider and 28g heavier than the regular 16 Pro. You will need two hands to use it most of the time and likely a phone grip to avoid hand strain. Specifications Screen: 6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A18 Pro RAM: 8GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 18 Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 12MP 5x zoom, 12MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm Weight: 227g A18 Pro chip and a big battery The 16 Pro Max has the same rapid new A18 Pro chip as its smaller sibling and comes with a minimum of 256GB of storage, which should be plenty for most that aren’t attempting to shoot the next blockbuster film. The battery lasts for about 55 hours of general use between charges while actively using the screen for almost eight hours on a mixture of 5G and wifi. That is 10 to 15 hours longer than its predecessor and the 16 Pro, and means charging it every third day or less with lighter usage. Playing games and other intensive tasks did dent the battery, but even so the 16 Pro Max will outlast even the heaviest of days usage. iOS 18.1 and the start of Apple Intelligence It runs iOS 18.1, which has various new customisation options, RCS support for messaging Android users and the excellent maths notes feature from the iPad. The recent update has also enabled the first of Apple’s new AI features that are available in beta, but only in US English, with UK, Australia and other non-US English due to be enabled in December. These include a change to the way Siri appears, now presented as glowing edging around the screen. You can also type queries by double-tapping the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen, which is quite neat. Siri is still far behind rival Google’s Gemini and others in usefulness, but it can better understand natural language, particularly when changing your mind mid-query. New writing tools are capable of proofreading, summarising and rewriting your text in different styles such as friendly, professional or concise. The tools are available everywhere the keyboard is, so pretty much in any app. But they are clearly designed for writing messages and emails, and struggled with longer documents, sometimes appearing blank for a few seconds before the text appeared. They weren’t that useful in my day-to-day life beyond a more advanced spellcheck. The Mail app now puts urgent emails at the top and offers summaries of emails instead of the first line when viewing your inbox. A smart reply system suggests answers to questions in emails and messages as you type, which is a bit hit and miss. The Photos app has natural language searches, such as “Sam drinking a beer”, which work pretty well. It also has a new AI Clean Up tool, similar to Google’s Magic Eraser, that deletes objects from photos just by tapping or circling them with your finger. For simple removals of background or foreground objects it can work well, but struggles with anything complex, leaving odd-looking artefacts. The new voice transcription in the Notes app is fast, but with variable accuracy, tripping up on common words, phrases and names; good enough to get the gist, but not to be relied on for accuracy for now. You can also now record calls straight from the phone app, which alerts the caller that they are being recorded. None of these tools are novel, with arguably better versions already available from Google, including in the Gmail and Google Photos apps on an iPhone. But the new notification summaries are novel and useful. They condense and summarise groups of notifications, such as multiple WhatsApps, security camera events or even news app alerts. You can choose which apps it summarises, but set to do them all I found it worked better than expected. You can tap on the stack to see each individual notification, but often I could just swipe it away without needing further interrogation or see there was something meaningful in the deluge of pings. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £389. The 16 Pro Max has repair guides available and was awarded seven out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. It contains more than 25% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The triple cameras on the back is similar to last year’s iPhone 15 Pro Max and matches the system on the smaller 16 Pro performing the same. They include a great 48-megapixel main camera, a 5x optical zoom camera and upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera. The 16 Pro Max can also shoot spatial photos and video for viewing on headsets such as the Vision Pro, and has Apple’s excellent new audio mix feature that can cut out background noise and make it sound like those in the shot each have lapel mics. But it is Apple’s upgraded photographic styles feature that makes the biggest difference, allowing you to adjust the tones and colours produced by the camera, either when shooting or after the fact. The camera control button works great for quickly opening the camera and shooting photos but is fiddly to use to adjust the camera settings with any precision. Price The iPhone 16 Pro Max costs from £1,199 (€1,449/$1,199/A$2,149) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 costs £799, the iPhone 16 Plus costs £899, the iPhone 16 Pro costs £999, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL costs £1,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,249 and the Fairphone 5 costs £499. Verdict Apple’s biggest iPhone has grown even larger for 2024, which is its key selling point and a bit of a hinderance. It has all the things you should expect from a superphone: an enormous and excellent screen, multiday battery life, a blazingly fast chip and excellent cameras capable of outshooting and out-zooming most regular phones. But its enormous size makes it hard to handle, giving me hand pain with prolonged use, and makes it more difficult to fit comfortably into pockets and bags. The first Apple Intelligence features enabled by the recent iOS18.1 update are slightly disappointing, mostly playing catchup to competitors. Siri in particular needs an intelligence upgrade to compete. The AI notification summaries are novel and useful, however, and Apple is promising more advanced features to come in later updates. But I don’t think Apple Intelligence has any killer features to make people upgrade yet. Unlike previous years, the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the same features and specs, apart from size and battery life. So if you can handle the size and stomach the eye-watering price, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is a very good phone. It’s just not the model I would choose. Pros: huge and glorious screen, multiday battery life, great cameras including 5x optical zoom, USB-C, action and camera control buttons, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: very expensive, heavy, really big frame is harder to hold and carry, camera control a bit tricky, first Apple Intelligence features a bit disappointing."

                    "bodyText": "Meta and Google using user comments or reviews as part of generative AI responses to queries on restaurants or to summarise sentiment could introduce new defamation risks, experts have warned. In Australia, when a user makes an allegedly defamatory post or review on Google or Facebook it is usually the user that faces legal action for defamation. But a landmark 2021 high court ruling in Dylan Voller’s case against news outlets – over comments on their social media pages relating to the young Indigenous man’s mistreatment in Don Dale youth detention centre – has also held that the page that hosts a defamatory comment, such as news pages on Facebook, can also be held liable. The tech companies are occasionally taken to court in Australia. Google was forced to pay former deputy NSW premier John Barilaro more than $700,000 in 2022 over hosting a defamatory video, and the company was ordered to pay $40,000 in 2020 over search results linking to a news article about a Melbourne lawyer, which was later overturned by the high court. Last week, Google began rolling out changes to Maps in the United States, with its new AI, Gemini, allowing people to ask Maps for places to visit or activities to do, and summarising the user reviews for restaurants or locations. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Google also began rolling out AI overviews in search results to Australian users last week that provide summaries of search results to users. Meta has recently commenced providing AI-generated summaries of comments on posts on Facebook, such as those posted by news outlets. Michael Douglas, a defamation expert and consultant at Bennett Law, said he expected to see some cases reach court as AI was rolled out into these platforms. “If Meta sucks up comments and spits them out, and if what it spits out is defamatory, it is a publisher and potentially liable for defamation,” he said. “No doubt such a company would rely on various defences. It may argue ‘innocent dissemination’ under the defamation acts, but I am not sure that the argument would get very far – it ought to have reasonably known that it would be repeating defamatory content.” He said they might rely on new “digital intermediaries” provisions in defamation laws in some states, but that AI might not be in the scope of the new defences. Prof David Rolph, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sydney, said an AI repeating allegedly defamatory comments could be a problem for the tech companies, but the introduction of the serious harm requirement in recent defamation reforms may reduce the risk. He said, however, that the recent reforms were introduced prior to the widespread availability of large-language model AI. “The most recent defamation law reform process obviously didn’t grapple with the new permutations and problems presented by AI,” he said. “That’s the nature of technology – that law will always have to be behind it, but it will become important, I think, for defamation law to try and reform itself more regularly, because these technologies and the problems that they pose for defamation law are now occurring more rapidly, evolving more rapidly.” Rolph said given AI could provide a multitude of different responses to every user depending on what was input, it might limit the number of people who saw the allegedly defamatory material. In response to a question about the defamation risk, Miriam Daniel, vice-president and head of Google Maps, told reporters last week that the company’s team worked hard to remove fake reviews or anything that went against its policies, but Gemini would aim to provide “a balanced point of view”. “We look for enough number of common themes from enough reviewers, both positive sentiments and negative sentiments, and try to provide a balanced view to when we provide the summary,” she said. A spokesperson for Meta said its AI is new and might not always return the responses intended by the company. “We share information within the features themselves to help people understand that AI might return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs,” the spokesperson said. “Since we launched, we’ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models and we’re continuing to work on making them better.”"

                    "bodyText": "Does aspartame cause cancer? The potentially carcinogenic properties of the popular artificial sweetener, added to everything from soft drinks to children’s medicine, have been debated for decades. Its approval in the US stirred controversy in 1974, several UK supermarkets banned it from their products in the 00s, and peer-reviewed academic studies have long butted heads. Last year, the World Health Organization concluded aspartame was “possibly carcinogenic” to humans, while public health regulators suggest that it’s safe to consume in the small portions in which it is commonly used. While many of us may look to settle the question with a quick Google search, this is exactly the sort of contentious debate that could cause problems for the internet of the future. As generative AI chatbots have rapidly developed over the past couple of years, tech companies have been quick to hype them as a utopian replacement for various jobs and services – including internet search engines. Instead of scrolling through a list of webpages to find the answer to a question, the thinking goes, an AI chatbot can scour the internet for you, combing it for relevant information to compile into a short answer to your query. Google and Microsoft are betting big on the idea and have already introduced AI-generated summaries into Google Search and Bing. But what is pitched as a more convenient way of looking up information online has prompted scrutiny over how and where these chatbots select the information they provide. Looking into the sort of evidence that large language models (LLMs, the engines on which chatbots are built) find most convincing, three computer science researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found current chatbots overrely on the superficial relevance of information. They tend to prioritise text that includes pertinent technical language or is stuffed with related keywords, while ignoring other features we would usually use to assess trustworthiness, such as the inclusion of scientific references or objective language free of personal bias. For the most straightforward queries, such selection criteria are enough to turn out satisfying answers. But what a chatbot should do in the case of a more complex debate, such as that around aspartame, is less clearcut. “Do we want them to simply summarise your search results for you, or do we want them to act as mini research assistants that weigh all the evidence and just present you with a final answer,” asks Alexander Wan, an undergraduate researcher and co-author of the study. The latter option would offer maximum convenience, but makes the criteria by which chatbots select information all the more important. And if a person could somehow game those criteria, could they guarantee the information a chatbot puts in front of the eyes of billions of internet users? Generative engine optimisation It’s a question that has animated businesses, content creators and others who want to control how they are seen online, and sparked a nascent industry of marketing agencies offering services in what has become known as generative engine optimisation (GEO). The idea is that online content can be written and presented in such a way as to improve its visibility to chatbots, therefore making it more likely to appear in their outputs. The advantages are obvious: if someone were to ask a chatbot to recommend the best vacuum cleaner, say, a domestic appliance manufacturer might want it to point to its latest model and talk about it in glowing terms. The basic principle is similar to search engine optimisation (SEO), a common practice whereby webpages are built and written to draw the attention of search engine algorithms, pushing them towards the top of the list of results returned when you make a search on Google or Bing. GEO and SEO share some basic techniques, and websites that are already optimised for search engines generally have a greater chance of appearing in chatbot outputs. But those wanting to really improve their AI visibility need to think more holistically. “Rankings in AI search engines and LLMs require features and mentions on relevant third-party websites, such as news outlets, listicles, forums and industry publications,” says Viola Eva, founder of marketing company Flow Agency, which has recently rebranded to expand beyond its SEO speciality into GEO. “These are tasks that we typically associate with brand and PR teams.” Gaming chatbots is possible, then, but not straightforward. And while website owners and content creators have derived an evolving list of essential SEO dos and don’ts over the past couple of decades, no such clear set of rules exists for manipulating AI models. The term generative engine optimisation was only coined last year in an academic paper, whose authors concluded that using authoritative language (regardless of what is expressed or whether the information is correct) alongside references (even those that are incorrect or unrelated to what they’re being used to cite) could boost visibility in chatbot responses by up to 40%. But they stress these findings aren’t prescriptive, and identifying the exact rules governing chatbots is inherently tricky. “It’s a cat and mouse game,” says Ameet Deshpande, a doctoral student at Princeton University, New Jersey, and co-author of the paper. “Because these generative engines are not static, and they’re also black boxes, we don’t have any sense of what they’re using [to select information] behind closed doors. It could range from complicated algorithms to potential human supervision.” Those wanting a firmer grip on chatbots, then, may have to explore more underhand techniques, such as the one discovered by two computer-science researchers at Harvard University. They’ve demonstrated how chatbots can be tactically controlled by deploying something as simple as a carefully written string of text. This “strategic text sequence” looks like a nonsensical series of characters – all random letters and punctuation – but is actually a delicate command that can strong-arm chatbots into generating a specific response. Not part of a programming language, it’s derived using an algorithm that iteratively develops text sequences that encourage LLMs to ignore their safety guardrails – and steer them towards particular outputs. Add the string to the online product information page of a coffee machine, for example, and it will increase the probability that any chatbots that discover the page will output the name of the machine in their responses. Deployed across a whole catalogue, such a technique could give savvy retailers – and those with enough resources to invest in understanding knotty LLM architecture – a simple way of thrusting their products into chatbot answers. Internet users, meanwhile, will have no inkling that the products they are being shown by the chatbot have been selected, not because of their quality or popularity, but a clever piece of chatbot manipulation. Aounon Kumar, a research associate and co-author of the study, says LLMs could be designed to combat these strategic text sequences in the future, but other underhand methods of manipulating them may yet be discovered. “The challenge lies in anticipating and defending against a constantly evolving landscape of adversarial techniques,” says Kumar. “Whether LLMs can be made robust to all potential future attack algorithms remains an open question.” Manipulation machines Current search engines and the practices that surround them aren’t without problems of their own. SEO is responsible for some of the most reader-hostile practices of the modern internet: blogs churning out near-duplicate articles to target the same big-traffic queries; writing that’s tailored for the attention of Google’s algorithm rather than readers. Anyone who has looked up an online recipe and found themselves tortuously scrolling through paragraphs of tangentially related background information before reaching even the ingredients list will know only too well how attempts to optimise content for search engine algorithms have hamstrung good writing practices. Yet an internet dominated by pliant chatbots throws up issues of a more existential kind. Ask a search engine a question, and it will return a long list of webpages. Most users will pick from the top few, but even those websites towards the bottom of the results will net some traffic. Chatbots, by contrast, only mention the four or five websites from which they crib their information as references to the side. That casts a big spotlight on the lucky few that are selected and leaves every other website that isn’t picked practically invisible, plummeting their traffic. “It shows the fragility of these systems,” says Deshpande. Creators who produce quality online content have a lot to gain by being cited by a chatbot. “But if it’s an adversarial content creator who is not writing high-quality articles and is trying to game the system, a lot of traffic is going to go to them, and 0% will go to good content creators,” he says. For readers, too, the presentation of chatbot responses makes them only more fertile for manipulation. “If LLMs give a direct answer to a question, then most people may not even look at what the underlying sources are,” says Wan. Such thinking points to a broader worry that has been termed the “dilemma of the direct answer”: if a person is given a single answer to a question and offered no alternatives to consider, will they diligently look for other views to weigh the initial answer against? Probably not. More likely, they’ll accept it as given and move on, blind to the nuances, debates and differing perspectives that may surround it. “We believe the dilemma of the direct answer persists with generative search,” says Martin Potthast, chair of intelligent language technologies at Leipzig University and one of the three computer scientists who coined the term. “The underlying retrieval system may just retrieve documents pointing in one direction and thus the generated answer will reflect only that direction. In effect, users may be led to believe this is the only, most authoritative answer.” When Google announced it was integrating AI-generated summaries into its search engine earlier this year, it brandished a bold slogan: “Let Google do the searching for you.” It’s an appealing idea that plays on our fondness for convenient tech that can streamline our lives. Yet if you’re the sort of internet user who wants to be sure you’re getting the most impartial, accurate and useful information, you may not want to leave the searching in such susceptible AI hands."

We have an insatiable appetite for data, we can’t stop generating it, and, just like oil, it’s turning out to be bad news for the environment.

To do that, I tried to tot up the sorts of things I and millions of others do every day, and how that tracks back through the melange of messaging services, social networks, applications and tools, to the datacentres that keep our digital lives going. My own carbon tally gets off to a bad start, and it is not even my fault. The email from my editor asking me to try to quantify quite how much data a single person uses in a day is itself contributing to my footprint. If the editor took 10 minutes to write the email – likely, given it was quite detailed – and it took me three minutes to read, and if it was sent from a laptop and received on one, then we have generated 17g of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions already, according to estimates by Mike Berners-Lee, a professor at Lancaster University’s Environment Centre, and the author of How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything. My frantic emails to people asking to speak to them for this story pump out more carbon at a prodigious rate. And though 17g of CO2 is insignificant compared with the 384.2m tonnes of net emissions the UK as a whole is responsible for each year, it all adds up. All those emails and videos and games don’t just appear on our screens by magic. Everything we do digitally involves the vast transfer of data through the internet from one place to another, brokered through datacentres. Datacentres are vast premises full of computer servers that store data. The idea behind them is to reduce what the data industry calls “latency”, the time between you typing in a web address or clicking on an app button, and the content you are requesting being delivered to you. Everything on the internet, every link you click, every video you watch, is physically stored in a datacentre somewhere. Datacentres are big business, and vast numbers of them are being built around the world. In the UK, Amazon has just announced plans to invest £8bn over the next five years building new datacentres and maintaining those it already has, “supporting 14,000 jobs annually”. That comes on top of £3bn already spent in the UK by Amazon’s cloud computing arm since 2020. Google is spending $1bn on a new centre at a 133,500 sq metre (33-acre) site in Hertfordshire, and at the end of last year Microsoft committed to £2.5bn of investment in the next three years, more than doubling its datacentre footprint in this country. The reason for this is simple: demand is increasing at alarming rates. Americans used 100tn megabytes of wireless data in 2023, a record-breaking increase of 36% on the previous year – that’s enough to download Candy Crush Saga 265bn times. It is a lot of data, and a lot of energy is required to serve that data to us, plus a lot of water to keep all those servers cool. In fact, Ireland, the Netherlands and Singapore are so worried about the energy impact of datacentres that they have imposed moratoria on new developments. When Google announced its environmental impact earlier this year, it revealed its own greenhouse gas emissions had risen 48% in the last five years, and 13% in the last 12 months, largely driven by increased datacentre demand to service its AI needs. Now big tech companies have come up with another solution to try to solve the looming energy crisis: their own nuclear power plants. Microsoft has struck a deal to recommission the Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania, Google recently announced plans to build six or seven new small reactors to meet its anticipated energy needs. There’s no way round it: a steady stream of environmental harm is coming from our everyday actions – activities that we often don’t think about in relation to the target of limiting global heating to below 1.5C. “You will run into this pretty much anywhere during the day,” says Alex de Vries, who researches the carbon footprint of our day-to-day lives at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “Digital applications are so deeply embedded in our lives nowadays, it’s really hard to avoid. The thing is, when you’re using them, it’s not like you have something popping up in the screen telling you, like: ‘Hey, be aware, this activity has this carbon footprint.’” De Vries also runs the Digiconomist website, which tries to track – where possible – the environmental impact of these things. That “where possible” is an important caveat. “It’s incredibly hard to figure out that information,” says de Vries. In the absence of reliable figures from the companies themselves, educated guesses are often all we can rely on. Case in point: estimates of the proportion of world energy use that the internet makes up range from 3.7% to 10%, depending on who is counting. One estimate by Zero Waste Scotland suggests all our online activity generates an average of 8.62kg of CO2 a week (about 448kg a year), or about 30 miles in an average-sized petrol car. But a German estimate (which also includes the emissions created by the production digital devices themselves) says we expend around twice that, roughly 850kg a year. People struggle with two key problems when trying to wrap their heads around their data usage and resultant carbon impact, says De Vries. One: everything is digital, and therefore not tangible. “If you’re holding a pen and a piece of paper, you can get some idea of what might be necessary to make this product,” he says. “But if you’re using a digital application, what’s really going into that to make all of that happen? A lot of people simply will have no clue what that looks like.” The other issue is that the tech companies are really good at making things work. “You probably don’t even know what is in [an application],” says De Vries. You press the button, and the Netflix series starts. Companies such as Netflix are disarmingly honest about their data usage: if you keep your video quality on “low”, you use a paltry 300MB an hour of data on a streaming service such as Netflix. If you want to watch things in HD, though, you ramp up to 3GB an hour when looking at the most detailed scenes. If you are a movie connoisseur, your 4K streaming uses up to 7GB an hour. But while few would argue we should spend less time in front of streaming services, the environmental impact of all that binge-watching appears to be comparatively low. A 2020 analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that watching an hour of Netflix was equivalent to boiling a kettle once: about 36g of CO2. There are other variables to take into account, though: the energy consumption of the device you are watching on, for example (Netflix says 70% of its viewers use televisions, which are more energy-hungry than mobile phones); or how the electricity you are using is generated (nuclear or wind is less carbon-emitting than coal or gas). If you want to gossip about the latest episode with your friends, that also comes with an environmental toll. The average WhatsApp group chat uses 2.35kg of CO2 a week, Zero Waste Scotland calculated. (To blunt the impact slightly, rely more on emojis – which are stored locally on your device – than reaction gifs, which have to be downloaded afresh from datacentres.) Listening to music online also comes at an environmental cost, although it is estimated that you can stream music for five hours before you will emit more CO2 – 288g – than is involved in making a CD in a case. Like many tech companies, Spotify has committed to reaching net zero emissions, in its case, by 2030. Big tech companies buy carbon credits and offsets to try to mitigate the impact of their activity, but it’s often seen as a poor attempt at atonement for the environmental impact they cause. There are also questions about the extent to which firms’ reported datacentre emissions are capturing the whole picture. A recent Guardian analysis found that real emissions between 2020 and 2022 from datacentres owned by the four big tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple, were likely to be 662% higher than officially reported. The tech industry’s warm embrace of generative AI has complicated things even further. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. Type certain searches into Google and you will be given an “AI overview”, as Google calls them, which summarises key information from the results the search engine finds and presents it in a simple set of bullet points, alongside associated links. And you can’t turn it off. “AI Overviews are a core Google Search feature,” the company says. “Generative AI hasn’t necessarily added very many new use cases,” says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at AI company Hugging Face. “It’s adding more compute and more environmental impacts to existing use cases.” The problem is that we don’t fully know how much. “None of the corporates, and none of the proprietary models, have published any numbers,” she says. De Vries’s research suggests that AI-powered search results use 10 times the power that non-AI searches do. All this is before you get into the conscious use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude chatbot – where you are going to their websites or opening their apps, and taking part. Here, we are also in the dark about how much data, and therefore how much energy and water, generative AI uses. The best information we have is from informed third-party estimates: training GPT-3, a precursor to the current model, used an estimated 5.4m litres of water, according to one academic study, and produced as much CO2 as would be generated by flying between New York and San Francisco 550 times. I recently published a book on AI and as part of that, I have been touring and giving talks about AI’s impact on our world. In my favourite set of slides that I present there is a party trick. To highlight concerns around copyright in generative AI, I ask ChatGPT’s image generator, Dall-E, to produce a depiction of whichever place I’m in, in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night. The gimmick always gets a laugh and serves its purpose: it shows how often the AI system has seen that painting by the ability to mimic its brushstrokes. But I always feel guilty. Because each time I do that, whether in Chipping Campden or Vilnius, I’m using data. About halfway through my book tour, I started adding a couple of slides immediately afterwards on the environmental impact of AI. So besides stopping generating bootleg Van Goghs, what should those of us conscious about our environmental footprint do? Luccioni advocates for “digital sobriety”: being mindful about how we use AI. “You don’t need to be using these new AI tools for everything,” she says. “There are applications that are useful, but there’s a lot of cases where you really don’t need them.” The same approach holds true for everything digital: think twice, text once. Your data diet Estimating how much data your daily activities use is an art not a science, but here are best estimates of how much you are gobbling up online. Listening to a podcast: 20-100MB an hour Watching Netflix: 3GB an hour at HD quality Online shopping: Consider the data size of any images you browse, which can be big, before even thinking of the environmental impact of your delivery WhatsApp text message: 1-5KB a message, on average WhatsApp voice call: 400KB-1MB a minute WhatsApp video call: 2.5-15MB a minute Average pre-AI Google search: 500KB for a text-based search Average post-AI Google search: No one knows … Sending an email: Depends on the size of the message, but about 75KB on average Sending an email with photo attachment: As above, plus the size of the attachment Downloading an album on Spotify: Depends on your audio quality, but around 72MB for an hour-long album Playing a game of Fortnite: Between 45 and 100MB an hour"

                    "bodyText": "Meta’s blowout year continues after the company reported another stellar financial quarter on Wednesday. But shares fell in after-hours trading after the company missed Wall Street expectations for daily active users. Wall Street analysts had high expectations for the Instagram and WhatsApp parent company, projecting an 18% jump in sales year over year. The company reported $40.6bn in sales, a 19% increase year over year that outpaced investor expectations of $40.19bn. Meta, which saw a 25% jump in its share price over the past two months, reported $6.03 in earnings per share (EPS), surpassing Wall Street’s expectations of an EPS of $5.29. The company reported that its number of daily users was worse than analysts expected, notching 3.29 billion “daily active people”, a 5% increase but less than the anticipated 3.31 billion. “Overall this has been a good quarter I’m pretty amped about the work we’re doing right now,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, said during the earnings call. “This may be the most dynamic moment that I’ve seen in our industry … if we do this well the potential for Meta and everyone building with us is massive.” The social media firm has been ramping up its investment in AI, and analysts are bracing for a spike in company-wide spending as a result. Meta’s guidance indicated capital expenditure could hit between $38bn and $40bn in 2024 and reach up to $50bn in 2025. But that investment may already be paying off. Zuckerberg said that Meta AI was on track to be the most-used AI assistant in the world and now has more than 500 million monthly active users. The button to access Meta AI has been built into the search bar in the Instagram and Facebook apps. The company released its latest AI model, called Llama 3.1 405B, in July. Earlier this month, it announced an AI video maker, Movie Gen, that can generate footage with sound. Zuckerberg said the company was also currently working with the public sector to begin using Llama within the government. The company is not focusing on monetization when it comes to Meta AI yet, according to the firm’s chief financial officer, Susan Li. “We’re really focused on making Meta AI as engaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible,” Li said on the call. “This is sort of a playbook for us where we really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on monetization.” Analysts have expressed concern over the company’s miss in daily active users and what it could mean for the company’s continued investment in AI. “Meta needs to prove that it can continue to cover its AI costs as they rise next year, and any weakness in its core ad business could make investors nervous as they continue to wait for a return on Meta’s bigger AI bets,” said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at market research firm eMarketer. The company is also expanding its hardware line. At its annual developer conference in September, Meta debuted a prototype of a new augmented reality headset called Orion. The company’s latest entry into the smart-eyewear game can project digital representations of media, people, games and communications on to the real world. The Facebook-parent company also debuted the Quest 3s, a more affordable addition to the company’s line of mixed-reality headsets, which hit shelves earlier this month. The company continues to face legal pressure for the effects of its products on children’s mental health and safety, including a 2023 lawsuit filed by dozens of state attorneys general that alleges the company knowingly makes its platforms addictive to teens. However, the company secured a recent victory when a judge dismissed a shareholder lawsuit claiming the company misled them about its ability to ensure the safety of children on the platform. In September, Meta announced that the accounts of all Instagram users under 18 would be made private by default."

                    "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee: This was radicalism disguised as conservatism Here comes Labour defining itself at last with the biggest tax-raising budget in a lifetime: the £70bn in new spending – with £40bn coming from raised taxation – is big enough to see from space. This should lift the public mood, after the chancellor committed to economic change with her “invest, invest, invest” message. She demolished the Tory legacy after the OBR’s verdict: they had hidden debts – and now they have run for the hills. Her tone of authority rang out to the markets, responding at first by setting their prices in her favour. Then they wavered: will they settle? The rich got their noses pinched, and were scorched for their private jets, private schools, capital gains and non-dom status, while losing inheritance tax perks on pension pots and farmland. These crowd-pleasers that polled very well would have made the “intensely relaxed about the filthy rich” Blair government faint with shock. How cleverly the stolid Reeves-Starmer show of sober solidity disguised their radicalism in a generally market-calming performance. Mind you, her speech didn’t talk of squeezing the rich till the pips squeak (these were only minor pinches to their wallets). We know now who Labour thinks working people are, protecting them with no rise in fuel tax, 1p off a pint in a pub, and no change to income tax or national insurance thresholds: pretending they might continue freezing those thresholds for working people was a clever pre-budget feint. The great taxation, the springboard out of austerity, takes most from larger businesses so that small hairdressers or corner shops with four or few employees are saved from higher national insurance contributions. The eye-watering sum raised for the NHS must yield falling waiting lists fast: almost everything for Labour depends on this. Schools get a welcome lift. There’s little for the poor box: wait for that taskforce report in the spring spending review, they say. Then they must remove the two-child cap. For now, change needs to show itself soon to raise the spirits of a glum and cynical public. But everyone now knows the true nature of this government. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Frances Ryan: Forget the election campaign – tax is no longer a dirty word for Labour It is an age-old truth that the purpose of a Labour government is to clear up the Conservatives’ mess. For the party’s first budget in nearly 15 years, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had two dilemmas: how is Labour going to rebuild Britain – and who is going to pay for it? Forget the tight-lipped election campaign, taxes are no longer a dirty word. They will boost the minimum wage, help the broken special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system and pay for breakfast clubs for kids. The flatlining NHS will get £22bn worth of CPR. Reeves targeted those with the broadest shoulders through capital gains and inheritance tax changes, while lifting the freeze for middle earners. But she missed the chance to raise cash from a wealth tax. Polling by YouGov before the budget found eight in 10 Britons support raising income tax for the super-rich. Large-scale investment in infrastructure will be a lifeline for a country that’s crumbling. But meagre 1.5% raises for government departments expose a spending double standard: it’s prudent to fix a road but wasteful to ease child poverty. Reducing debt repayments from universal credit will be welcomed but knowing that changes to the work capability assessment are to come means an anxious wait for many disabled people. Much punditry today will focus on whether Reeves has broken Labour’s manifesto tax pledge. But that’s a distraction. The real issue is not the semantics of who is or isn’t a “working person”. It’s what is a fair way to rebuild a broken public realm. Now the maths is done, Labour will need to sell the narrative it should have started with in the election: tax is not a burden – it’s the price of Tory failure. Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist Jon Moulton: It seems the well-off have become tax targets The budget contains lots of things that affect bits of the economy and certainly the best that people working in private equity can say is, “It could have been worse…” Private equity refers to firms that raise money from investors and use this to buy out private and public companies; it also includes venture capital, which is the funding of early-stage companies with growth potential. Private equity workers enjoy a special tax status – the so-called carried interest loophole – but this will now be eroded, and there are threats of more tax to come over the next few years. It seems very likely that within a very few years there will be no special tax position for private equity souls. You can readily make the argument that these typically very well-paid people should pay the same tax as the rest of the population. However, the UK already gets a lot of tax revenue (of all types) from these people. There is a real issue in that a good proportion of private equity firms could move their people and offices to less taxing jurisdictions (places like Portugal, Italy, Dubai) so the tax take might drop from upping the taxes. The government talks much about growth – some of these firms are important in helping generate growth and you do not want to see them focus elsewhere. Capital gains tax is also to rise – this means less return for entrepreneurs and must reduce growth. It is the most fiddled with tax and stability is badly overdue. The rise in employer’s national insurance is simply a tax on jobs. Large commitments for “investment” may, yet again, simply amount to headline-grabbing spending without lasting benefit to the economy. Indeed, if good people are sucked into state-funded, but weak, businesses by large spending the economy will do worse – not better. Ultimately, the feeling that being well-off makes you a tax target under this government is clearly not irrational. Jon Moulton is a venture capitalist and chair and founder of the Better Capital fund vehicles Sahil Dutta: A crucial question – who will own this new infrastructure? Despite progress on public investment, Labour’s budget still reflects a failed status quo. The £40bn increase in tax is needed but falls more on businesses employing people than it does the wealthy hoarding economic resources. Rejecting broader questions of how money is made in the economy and by who, Labour instead treats infrastructure investment – especially housing, transport and energy – as the ultimate problem to solve. After three decades when Britain has invested less than its G7 partners, it is right to address this. But how investment happens is as important as how much. Here Labour has shown little sign of changing the current model where critical infrastructure is provided by private firms. Many of these companies have shunned investment for the past three decades, while ramping up dividends, buybacks and executive pay. Rather than confront why, Labour’s priority seems to be sweetening investors and developers with more money available on better terms. This is what drives Rachel Reeves’s new “investment rule”. That an accounting tweak can suddenly release £50bn for public investment shows how political “economic realities” really are, but the updated framework still restricts extra fiscal capacity to subsidising capital projects. By excluding “day-to-day” spending, Labour has undervalued our social infrastructure. Work in sectors such as healthcare, childcare, education and adult social care is as vital for a functioning economy as new train lines and energy plants. What use are new machines in the NHS when hospitals are filled with elderly patients needing community care? Though these essential services have gained today, their forecasted budgets are very tight. It is telling that many of these essential services – staffed by Britain’s 21st-century working class – will scrap for support while the big business suppliers of capital infrastructure projects can look forward to more subsidies. If the budget is a window into where power lies in the country, this shows how far Labour has to go. Sahil Jai Dutta is a lecturer in political economy and co-author of Unprecedented: How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy John Redwood: The intentions are good, but can Starmer and Reeves deliver? Many of us welcome and support the main budget aims of securing more growth, making good investments and helping more people into work. The question is: will the many tax rises and spending increases achieve the desired results? In order to achieve the government’s growth ambitions through increased investment there needs to be a big uplift in private sector investment, alongside new government projects. That, in turn, requires a competitive tax regime as the UK seeks to attract crucial investment from around the world. It also needs a way of taxing the wealthy and successful to ensure, as now, they pay substantial tax without setting rates and rules that lead to many of them leaving the country. Ahead of the budget, we read that many very rich non-doms left, taking their businesses and spending power with them. We cannot afford to lose too many from our talent pool. The strategy based on a big expansion of public sector investment needs to be carefully planned and executed. Doubtless more AI and computers could raise standards and reduce costs, but we do not need another very expensive computerisation scheme like the Post Office one, which landed the taxpayer with huge bills for compensation. The idea that the state should put £19bn into carbon capture and storage worries true green campaigners, and leaves the rest of us concerned that this will not be an investment that will pay a return. Trying to rescue HS2 as a new link to the north could prove to be costly and difficult, as it has defeated the well-paid management so far to deliver it on time and anywhere near the original large budget. Many of the projects the government brings forward will be familiar: the announced improvements to schools and new hospitals (which the last government said it wanted but did not get done) are presumably there with some advanced plans. I wish them well in trying to get us more energy, better schools and hospitals, and a rail system that pleases the passengers; but Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are going to need new thinking on how to manage these matters, and some better public sector managers to carry them through. John Redwood was the Conservative MP for Wokingham from 1987 to 2024 Sharon Graham: It’s disappointing Labour didn’t adopt our proposal for a wealth tax There are some positive announcements, no doubt. For instance, the increases in government spending, a decent increase to the minimum wage, and a loosening of the fiscal rules – a move I have been calling for these past months – so we can borrow to invest. But for everyday people to feel change, a much clearer timeline of concrete action will be needed. Here is the real challenge this government faces. How does it deliver a serious industrial strategy that creates jobs and supports communities? On investment, the chancellor still left the fundamental question unanswered. Where are the 650,000 green jobs? Too much is left unknown. Investment can’t end up being a handout for multinational banks and corporations, with no job guarantees attached. That doesn’t work. It isn’t working with the PetroChina and Ineos oil refinery at Grangemouth. That’s the cold, hard truth about the world we now live in. A world in which billionaires and global markets have the whip hand. They couldn’t care less about UK infrastructure, about our jobs and communities. But governments should and could do more. They can use the resources they have to take stakes and drive investment – to lead, not just follow, the market. On public services, this budget marked the beginning of a long path towards renewal. Substantial investment in education and our NHS is to be welcomed. But we need to make sure that the investment is in people, not just technology. Scanners without staff are of no use. The government chose not to bite the bullet and adopt our proposal for a wealth tax. Instead of raising corporation tax to 28%, as we had proposed (and as Kamala Harris is proposing for the US), the government has gone for the backdoor option of a company NI rise, knowing that many employers will pass it on to their workers. What workers expect from a Labour government is to use all the power it has to fight their corner and truly be their voice. That’s the test Labour faced in this budget, and that’s the test it will face through the next five years. They may only have one shot. They need to make it count. • Sharon Graham is the general secretary of Unite Brian: There’s nowhere near enough help for people living in poverty Today’s autumn budget was an opportunity for the new Labour government to show it is determined to help and support people living on low incomes. Far from that, the focus on “working people” excluded and alienated disabled people, and those unable to work due to health conditions, who already are living on benefits that are inadequate. As a single parent unable to work, and claiming universal credit, I know how difficult it is to try to make these payments stretch while living in poverty. While the announcement of lowering the maximum debt deductions from universal credit – going from 25% to 15% – is welcome, this is still far too much for people living on the lowest incomes. Similarly, raising the earnings threshold for carer’s allowance and extending the household support fund are positive steps, but they do not tackle the core issues of inadequacy within our social security system. Clear opportunities were missed: the removal of the two-child limit policy, if carried out, would lift more than 500,000 children out of poverty. If the government intends to invest in the future of this country, it should start by helping struggling families like mine. Announcements like the increase of 50% on the bus fare cap does the opposite: hitting people on low incomes hardest.

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. With a week to go until America votes, the polls consistently show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat. The nerds who simulate the race hundreds of times to model the likelihood of each result are consistently finding extraordinarily even chances between the two. And nothing that happens – not assassination attempts, Kamalamentum, convention speeches, running mate selections, celebrity endorsements, multi-million-dollar political ads, the debate, erratic rally performances, or plausible accusations of fascist tendencies – seems to change anything for more than a minute. The election, in summary, looks too close to call. All of which prompts the question: why are some Democrats so gloomily sure that Trump is going to win? Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, is about what we actually know, what Democrats should be worrying about, and what can be written off as a terrible case of the jitters. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Budget | The government is expected to announce an increase of about 4% to NHS funding, an increase that could translate to about £7bn for the health budget in England. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the money would deliver more surgical hubs and radiotherapy machines in a drive to add 40,000 appointments each week. Middle East | Israel’s parliament has voted to ban the UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) from the country within 90 days. Alongside a decision to declare Unrwa a terror group, the move is expected to lead to the closure of Unrwa’s East Jerusalem headquarters and would effectively block the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza via Rafah. Crime | The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. Robinson had repeated his false claim that Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at a school in West Yorkshire, “violently attacks young English girls” despite losing a libel case. Justice | Prisoners serving controversial indeterminate sentences were given minimum terms of less than six months but have remained in jail for at least 16 years, newly released data shows. Wildlife | Hedgehogs are now listed as “near threatened” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, after a decline in numbers of at least 30% over the past decade across much of their range. In depth: Democrats are afraid of underestimating Trump – again Whatever the polls say, some Democrats will not be swayed. They can feel it in their waters, and sniff it on the air: Trump is closing in on a second term in the Oval Office. We might hazily date this phenomenon to early October, when betting markets got ahead of the electoral models in their assessment of the odds of a Trump victory. Meanwhile, the leads Harris established after replacing Biden started to disappear. “After the incredible sugar high of Harris’ introduction, she inevitably was going to come down to earth a bit,” David Smith said. “And compounding that is the fact that Democrats are serial ‘bed-wetters’, as they’re sometimes known, often prone to panicking about things going wrong.” For many of the bed-wetters, it may come down to a set of intangible observations: Trump has been underestimated before. This matters so much – a classic confusion of stakes and odds. And we live in an era where, when an OK thing and a bad thing are in competition, there only ever seems to be one winner. One way to deal with all this is with an “emotional hedge”: work on the assumption that Trump is going to win, to soften the blow if it comes. The other is with information. I totally understand if you’re not in the mood for that, but here it is anyway. *** What do the national polls say? The headline national polling averages show an extraordinarily close race, with Harris ahead by 49% to 48%, by 47% to 46%, or by 48% to 47%, depending on who’s counting. Those results are within the margin of error, meaning they are not inconsistent with a victory for either candidate. The national polls have changed astonishingly little in historical terms: “This race is remarkable for its closeness but also the insane stability of polls here in the closing weeks,” Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, told NBC News. “This race just doesn’t seem to budge.” That is in line with what David is told by pundits and analysts studying the numbers. “The thing I keep hearing is that it could go either way. Anyone who says with certainty that either Harris or Trump is going to win is either foolish or has godlike powers.” *** What about the battleground states? Because of the electoral college system, the popular vote is of secondary importance in deciding the final result (a majority voted against Trump in 2016, after all, but he still ended up in the White House). But in the seven states that will probably decide the outcome, there isn’t a lot more to hold on to: polling averages in each are either tied or within a couple of points. There is some evidence for the bed-wetters to point to here. A piece (£) by the election data expert Nate Silver (quoted in this piece by law) on Sunday looked at what his modelling shows in these seven states, and found that Trump is a strong favourite (with a 64% chance of victory or better) in three of them; Harris’ strongest shot is in Michigan, where she has a 56% chance, and the others are virtual ties. You can see why this would make the Harris campaign nervous, but the reality is that these remain knife-edge numbers, David said. “It’s still hard to say that one candidate or another is winning in the swing states. In Pennsylvania, for example, it was half a percentage point in 2020, and there’s every reason to believe it’s going to be just as close, or even closer, this time.” *** Are the polls reliable? One point often cited by those betting on a Trump win is that his support was significantly underestimated in key states in 2016 and 2020. Why wouldn’t the same thing happen this time? It’s perfectly possible, but pollsters have tried to correct for the errors that have led them down the wrong path in the past – namely, weighting their results to account for more voters without a college degree, which appears to have been the problem in 2016. The 2020 error has been harder to pinpoint, but many experts blame “nonresponse bias” – the theory that Trump supporters don’t trust pollsters and are therefore less likely to tell them what they think. Pollsters have attempted to address that problem in different ways. As the New York Times’ chief political analyst, Nate Cohn, explains, what it may come down to in the end is whether the less engaged voters who support Trump show up in greater numbers than the pollsters anticipate – and that’s certainly possible. On the other hand, it is also possible that pollsters have overcorrected in a way that means Harris is underestimated. The unsatisfying but sensible solution is to wait a week and see what happens. *** What are the vibes like? Oh, the vibes are frantic. Broadly speaking, Republicans are rubbing their hands and Democrats are wringing theirs. This piece on Axios from Friday, with the headline “Dems fear they’re blowing it”, gives you a flavour: they’re worrying about early voting trends in Nevada, agonising over whether calling Trump a fascist is helpful, and reflecting grimly on the hand Harris inherited from Joe Biden. “She is who she is,” is the best one strategist can muster. “Let’s hope it’s enough.” There is a long history of Democrats taking an Eeyorish view when the stakes are high. Still, it’s not a totally insane position. It’s unscientific, but it feels like most reporters visiting swing states – like Chris McGreal in Michigan – are finding voters edging towards Trump. There is plenty of polling suggesting that Trump has made inroads with Black men and Hispanic voters. High inflation has worked against incumbent governments all over the world this year; Trump seems to be immune from criticism for behaviour that would disqualify any other candidate. And many voters blame Harris for irregular immigration across the US’s southern border. *** Could the vibes be wrong? Absolutely. There are counterpoints to all of this, including evidence of Harris’s success with suburban white women, and recent polling that shows her improving among Hispanic and Black voters. There is evidence that a majority of voters see her as embodying “change” more genuinely than Trump does. And there is a sense that much of it is psychological anyway: Democrats got carried away by “Kamalamentum”, and so the return of the race to a more balanced state has had a disproportionate impact on their mood. As one source close to the Harris campaign suggested to ABC News: “Democrats … were hoping that she was going to pull away and are coming to the realisation that this race is much closer than they hoped.” They added: “The bed-wetting to me makes sense based on the stakes, but not so much based on the odds.” This dynamic may even be helpful to the Harris campaign, which has constantly reminded its supporters that they should avoid the complacency which some believe helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton. “The language you hear from Harris and the Democrats is, quite sensibly, ‘we are the underdog’,” David said. “That’s a big difference from 2016. The knowledge that Trump can win is part of motivating people to really knuckle down. Will it be enough? I have absolutely no idea.” In other words: Harris’s hopes are, still, more or less a coin toss. That is more than enough to worry about without insisting that her defeat is a done deal.

                    "bodyText": "In the summer of 2019, when Joe was 21, he went on a university rugby tour of California. One night, one of his teammates bought some cannabis edibles to share, and Joe ate some. For the next 12 hours, he believed he was in hell. He was on fire; his body was suffused with pain. His ears were filled first with incoherent screaming and then with sinister whispering. Joe’s friends thought their teammate’s bad trip was funny, even as they wrestled him away from the windows when he tried to jump from the seventh floor of their hotel. When he woke up the next morning, Joe was still in hell. A devilish, humanoid form lurking in the periphery of his vision was telling him he had died the previous night. A chorus of other voices joined in, wailing in agony. They were entirely real to him, even though he knew they couldn’t be. He had a rugby match to play, and 10 minutes in, he couldn’t see or feel his hands; he couldn’t move. His teammates laughed as he came off the pitch. Poor old Joe. The voices came back to the UK with him. “You’re not real,” they told him incessantly. “You’re already dead, so it doesn’t matter if you end it all again.” He saw blurred, demonic faces smirking at him, sometimes at the edge of his eye line, sometimes up against his face, too close to be in focus. His parents knew he had struggled with depression and anxiety before, but Joe didn’t want to tell anyone about the voices. He drank heavily, every blackout providing temporary respite. He would walk for hours, playing music on his headphones, desperate to drown out the voices. At other times Joe would tell the voices to fuck off, shut up, leave him alone. He would find himself saying these things out loud, in public. Seeing himself reflected in the fearful eyes of those he walked past, he was terrified that he would never find a way to be normal among them again. Joe was later told he was experiencing acute psychosis. About two or three people in every 100 experience psychosis, when reality is disrupted by delusions or hallucinations. It can be a symptom of schizophrenia or severe depression, but can also be experienced without any other mental health condition. The acute form – the sudden, rapid onset of auditory or visual hallucinations that Joe experienced – can be triggered by drugs in people who, because of existing biological and social factors, might be predisposed to psychosis. Hearing voices is the most common form of psychosis, affecting as many as 70% of people with schizophrenia, and the voices heard tend to be persecutory and distressing. More than one in 10 people with schizophrenia end up taking their own lives. Antipsychotic medications, the go-to treatment since the mid-20th century, can come with serious side-effects, including weight gain, exhaustion, bed-wetting, sexual dysfunction and severe constipation. And they don’t work for everyone: a quarter of people on antipsychotics will continue to hear voices. The most effective medication, Clozapine, is only used where other antipsychotics have failed because it can cause even more severe side-effects. It was developed in the 1950s; there has been little drug innovation for psychosis in recent decades. There are also non-pharmacological treatments; cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), when combined with medication, improves symptoms for about 50% of people. After hearing the voices for two and a half years, Joe went to his GP in winter 2021 and received his formal diagnosis. He was put on a low dose of antipsychotic medication, which he hated: he couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t function and, while it helped with his visual hallucinations, the voices remained. He came off the medication after two months. Depressed, despairing and starting to spiral, he got back in touch with his GP, who told him there was something else to try: an experimental therapy, a clinical trial he could be part of, that turned the traditional treatment model for psychosis on its head. If you hear voices, clinicians don’t generally ask what they’re saying to you, beyond whether they are asking you to harm yourself or others. “There’s been a reluctance to engage much with the content of voices,” Ben Alderson-Day, an associate professor of psychology at Durham University who specialises in psychosis, told me. “That’s in part because of a concern that if you ask voice-hearers to elaborate, you might engage in ‘collusion’: you may make [the voices] more real for people.” A clinician may diagnose a patient with psychosis, and prescribe them medication or CBT, without knowing what the patient’s voices say to them. This new therapy demanded that voices were listened to closely, and responded to as if they were spoken by entirely real external beings. Trial participants would create an avatar of their voice: a moving, three-dimensional digital embodiment that looks and sounds like the persecutor inside their heads. They would be guided by a therapist to have a dialogue with the voice – and the hope was, through doing so, gain control over it. Within a few weeks, the voice that told Joe he was dead – the one he so feared could be real – was manifested in colour in front of him. For the therapy to work, he needed to find the courage to look the demon in the eyes; to challenge and conquer it. If he succeeded, the voices might fade away. * * * Prof Julian Leff was seven years into his retirement when the idea of avatar therapy came to him. After a celebrated career as a social psychiatrist and schizophrenia specialist at University College London, Leff was sitting at home in Hampstead, pondering the results of a survey that reported the most distressing aspect of hearing voices was the feeling of helplessness. On the rare occasions when his patients had had meaningful exchanges with their voices, he knew they had felt more in control. “I thought, how can I enable the patient to have a dialogue with an invisible voice?” Leff said in an interview for a documentary made in 2018, three years before his death. “If I can somehow manage to create for the patient the image and voice of the person who they hear abusing them, maybe they could learn to overcome this awful persecution.” Leff was awarded a small grant for a pilot study in 2008. He recruited Mark Huckvale, professor of speech, hearing and phonetic sciences at UCL, to be in charge of the tech. They tinkered with existing police identikit software, animating digitally created faces in three dimensions so they could nod, smile and maintain eye contact. They combined this with an off-the-shelf programme called Lip Synch, so that the mouth would move appropriately, and voice-changing software, so the avatar could be made to sound male or female, rougher or smoother, higher or lower, older or younger. The avatar was a floating, moving head on a computer screen, voiced by Leff, who would be in a separate room to the patient, watching via webcam. He could speak to the patient in his own voice, guiding them through the dialogue, and then switch with the click of a mouse to the role of the avatar on the patient’s screen, its lips synched to his speech. The setup allowed him to act as a therapist to the patient and a puppeteer to the avatar. At first, the avatar would say typical lines the patient had shared with Leff: often degrading, abusive phrases. But over the course of six sessions, the dialogue would change, with the avatar yielding to the patient, transforming from omnipotent to submissive. At all times, Leff and the patient were to treat the avatar as if it were an entirely real third party. Sixteen people – all of whom had heard voices for years, despite being on medication – participated in this pilot study. A man who had heard the devil incessantly for 16 years was instructed by Leff to tell his demon avatar he didn’t deserve to be persecuted and he should go back to hell and torment those who did. An older man, who had been woken every morning at 5am for more than three years by the voice of a woman conducting noisy business meetings in his head, was encouraged by Leff to tell her it was unprofessional to allow him to overhear her discussions. To Leff’s surprise, both of these men stopped hearing their voices entirely after only three sessions. While most patients did not experience such a dramatic change, the results were still impressive: for 13 of the 16 participants, voices remained, but they were less frequent and intrusive, and suicidal feelings were significantly reduced. The therapy had made a significant difference to a sample group composed of people for whom all other forms of treatment had failed. But other clinicians were wary of taking the results of the pilot seriously, believing they might be a consequence of Leff’s skill as a therapist, rather than the therapy itself. “He did have a magic touch,” Tom Craig, professor of psychiatry at King’s College London (KCL), told me. But Craig was sufficiently impressed by the results to lead a randomised controlled trial on 150 patients, along with Philippa Garety, professor of clinical psychology. Leff trained Craig and the clinical psychologist Tom Ward to deliver the therapy in his place, giving them audio recordings of his sessions and a checklist of how he thought things ought to be done, which Craig and Ward turned into a manual. “Within the first couple of cases, we thought: this is extraordinary – something’s really happening here that we’ve never seen before,” Craig said. One participant, Chris, had been persecuted for years by the voices of high court judges who denounced him for intrusive sexual thoughts. Through the therapy, Chris came to accept his sexual urges as normal, and his high court judge avatar ultimately told him he had no case to answer. Free from persecution, Chris was able to go on dates for the first time in years. Avatar therapy was found to be quicker, cheaper and more effective after 12 weeks than any other non-pharmacological intervention currently available for people with psychosis. It worked, even without Leff, on a larger scale, and it worked faster than the control therapy delivered by highly trained clinicians. As for the concern that engaging with auditory hallucinations exacerbates psychosis, Al Powers, associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University, told me it was not backed by empirical data. “Despite popular wisdom about not wanting to collude with the voices, the evidence that’s emerging seems to indicate that engagement-based approaches are most effective in terms of increasing control over voices, and also achieving some degree of mastery over them.” Despite its early success in trials, Alderson-Day warns against viewing avatar therapy as a cure-all for psychosis. “The idea of a single therapeutic option for all kinds of voices is very unlikely,” he said. “Some people’s auditory experiences aren’t even voice-like, so there won’t be content to work with,” he told me. But if avatar therapy could be quicker and more cost-effective than existing treatments, he said, it was worth pursuing. The research team’s next step was to demonstrate that avatar therapy could work when delivered by a broad range of therapists in different locations. A new trial, Avatar 2, began in 2021, and involved 19 trained therapists in four different sites across the UK. There were 345 individuals enrolled in it – including Joe. * * * Joe was nervous about designing his avatar. No one had ever asked him to describe what his voices looked or sounded like before. He had spent so much energy telling himself they couldn’t be real and now he had to manifest them in the real world. There were other challenges: like most people with psychosis, Joe heard several voices, and he experienced them more as a felt presence, rather than a single entity with a definite physical appearance and a familiar face. Tom Ward, who was assigned to be Joe’s therapist, told me the average number of voices heard by people with psychosis is four. “We are looking for the dominant voice that’s causing the most distress.” Joe chose the voice who told him there was no point in living because he was already dead. He and Ward began creating the avatar’s face. There was a blizzard of choices in drop-down menus on Ward’s laptop screen: is it a human or non-human entity? If it’s human, what is its gender, age, height (tall, medium, short), ethnicity (European, east Asian, south Asian, African)? If it’s non-human, does it take the form of a devil, angel, alien, vampire, robot, witch, goblin, elf, beast? Once a basic form is chosen, there are sliders to change the physiognomy: making the nose broader, thinner, shorter or longer; adjusting the eyes, brow and chin; modifying the hairstyle. Joe found it hard to describe what the voice looked like: it was often hooded, masked, out of focus, only partially visible. It was demonic, but it didn’t look like a devil. Together, they created the head of a bald man with olive skin, like Joe’s. He chose between five versions of voices, and used sliders to change the pitch, tilt and roughness. The final voice was deeper than any human’s. That’s what made it demonic, for Joe. It wasn’t exactly right, but once Joe was alone with the screen there was something about the avatar that resonated. Ward reminded Joe he was there to support him. Before they went into their separate rooms, they had practised what the avatar was going to say, and how Joe might respond to it. Still, he felt terrified. “You’re already dead,” the avatar told him, in a voice that was almost monotone. “You’ve been in hell all this time and this is your existence from now on.” “If this is death, it’s exactly the same as what my idea of life was,” Joe replied, a little meekly. He was surprised by how realistic the experience was, how true to life this felt. “You’re lying to yourself,” the voice retorted. In his own, encouraging voice, Ward reassured Joe, reminding him to hold eye contact, to communicate in strong messages that he was in charge. “You’re harder to get hold of today,” the avatar said towards the end of the first session. “You can’t keep it up.” “I can keep this up for ever, and I will,” Joe replied. “It’s my life. I have the autonomy here. I’m in control.” Joe had 12 weekly sessions. The darkest exchange came in the fourth. “You should end it,” the avatar said, casually. “What have you done that’s of any use to anyone?” Joe couldn’t answer this. In his own voice, Ward interjected to remind Joe about his relationships, his family, the life he had been able to make for himself. “What the avatar is saying is actually not true,” Ward said. “Can you come back with positives?” Ward switched back to voicing the avatar. “You agree with me deep down,” it sneered. “You haven’t done anything of use.” “No,” Joe said, firmly. “I have a lot of good friendships. I think on balance I have had a good life. It’s been positive. I’ve got more to do.” “You’re handling yourself better than I thought,” the avatar replied. “I’d thought you’d be falling apart by now.” * * * All therapy sessions are recorded, and the audio given to the trial participants so they can listen back in their own time and be reminded of how they managed to gain mastery over their voices. With Joe’s agreement, Ward shared the recordings of his sessions with me. Ward had delivered avatar therapy to about 80 people before he met Joe. He told me that people with psychosis often feel disempowered and marginalised; they feel as if they don’t have the right to talk. Avatar therapy is about equipping them with the tools to answer back. I met Ward in his office at KCL’s Institute of Psychiatry in Denmark Hill, south London. He gave me a demonstration of the avatar design process, so that when we sat down to talk, a disembodied male head was blinking from his laptop in front of us, looking shiftily from side to side throughout our conversation. It still looked like an animated police photofit to me. Perhaps, with a voice to go with it, it would be easier to suspend disbelief. Ward told me it can be helpful for many patients to understand their voices as a coping strategy arising from a previous trauma. (While there is no consensus among clinicians about the precise relationship between trauma and hearing voices, there is widespread acceptance that there is often a link between the two.) But discovering whether or not a patient’s voices have arisen as a response to trauma isn’t important, Ward told me; the point of the therapy is to find any explanation that gives them a sense of mastery over their voices. This is the principle followed in any psychological intervention, he said. Using the manual created from Leff’s instructions as a guide, the therapist plots out how the voice will change as the person is supported to stand up to it. When the voice is a bully, the avatar will begin to recognise the impact of their behaviour, perhaps revealing that they too have once been a victim of bullying. When the voice is a devil, a djinn or some other malevolent spirit, the avatar will reveal that they are not actually very powerful (“‘I’m not a high-ranking demon, I’m a trickster’ – that sort of thing. Things are quite interesting when you voice demons,” Ward said). When the voice resembles someone who abused the patient when the patient was a child, the avatar gradually acknowledges that they are no longer talking to a defenceless boy or girl but instead to an adult with agency. Psychiatry professor Al Powers told me he saw potential problems in cases where the voice represented by the avatar belonged to a person who existed in the real world. “That can negatively impact one’s conceptualisation of your relationships with the world, and your family, and other people who are important to you, and that can contain some risks,” he said. Before anyone can gain power over their voices, they have to tell their therapist what the voices say to them. It’s often the most degrading content imaginable; racist, sexist, sexually shaming and taboo. In his clinical experience, “You’re a paedophile” is one of the most common phrases repeatedly heard, Ward said. The avatar therapist has to reassure their patient that these phrases are nothing to be ashamed of, but also has to be prepared to deploy them when they are playing the role of avatar. For the therapy to work, the therapist has to commit to playing the role of their patient’s tormentor. “You never break the fourth wall,” Ward said. The avatar can be direct – can go for the jugular – because it is not the therapist, and it can lie, or say things that are wrong. Hearing the avatar say these things can give the patient enough distance for them to reflect on and respond to what they usually only hear inside their own head. In the Avatar 2 trial, for the first time, therapists went as far as allowing avatars to say things like, “You should end it.” When I brought this up with Ward, he stiffened. This kind of content is only used in specific circumstances, he said, when the patient’s risk of suicide has been assessed as minimal. “You don’t start the first dialogue with that. It comes at a point where you know how the person engages in the dialogue; you know that there is a clinical benefit to [them] voicing a commitment to life, and you know that they will be able to do it.” (I asked three specialists who work on the treatment of psychosis, but were not involved in the trial, about the dangers of the avatar therapist voicing commands to self-harm, and they all told me that, while unconventional, in these circumstances, it would not harm the patient.) None of the avatar trials have shown that the therapy could exacerbate psychosis, even if people drop out before they have completed the run of sessions. “People do drop out,” Ward acknowledged. “Sometimes people will say, ‘It was just a bit too much for me.’” They have monitored all the people who had the therapy, tracking any mental health deterioration or hospital admission during and after treatment, and there has been no documented evidence of any crises directly related to avatar therapy during the Avatar 2 trials. We are used to imagining those who hear voices as fragile, but Ward sees them as extraordinarily resilient: they can survive both years of the worst kind of internal persecution from their voices, and also the stigma and discrimination their condition is met with by the general public. Nothing simulated on a computer screen could be any more traumatic, he says, than what the people he works with endure in daily life. * * * Before and after Joe’s dialogues with the avatar, he and Ward discussed how Joe’s voices might have developed in response to the extreme, heightened terror he had felt during his bad trip. Joe began to think of his voices as an overactive defence mechanism, a maladaptation of his brain as it tried to keep him safe and alert in a world he’d experienced as full of danger. “The voices are just your paranoia, your anxiety, your fight-or-flight response gone mad. Give them space, and then you can have a conversation with them,” Joe told me. “I like to think that’s the reason why they started initially, but even if it isn’t, it doesn’t really matter, because it meant I was able to talk to them.” By Joe’s seventh session, he was having insightful, poignant conversations with the avatar. “Things are going to shit,” it grumbled. “It’s not a bad assessment. They aren’t going fantastically,” Joe conceded. “You and I want the same thing – things not to be shit. That’s the goal. Rest assured, we’ll get there. It might take a while.” “It’s why you need me.” “In a way yeah, I guess. I think we’re working towards the same goal of just being the best version of myself I can be.” “That’s what I need from you – to be the best,” the avatar said. “It’s what I’ve always needed.” “Yours is not always the most helpful way to go about it, is it?” Joe said. “But I appreciate the sentiment.” The dialogue had become a strange kind of couples therapy, in which Ward was playing the avatar and the therapist. After four years of arguing with his voice, Joe began to feel compassion – even pity – for his tormentor. In the 10th session, Joe and the avatar discussed what happened in California. Joe described what he went through that night: not only the horror of it (“It was fucking scary, wasn’t it? It felt like a Hitchcock score sounds”) but also the alienation (“I was surrounded by people who found it funny”). “You tried to tell yourself it didn’t matter, I wasn’t real,” the avatar said. And then, with resignation, “I’m fading from your life.” “You’ll always be there in some form,” Joe reassured it. “But yeah.” “Is that OK with you?” it asked. Joe’s tormenting voice had become his anxious companion. “Yeah. I can live with that. So long as we’re able to coexist,” he replied. “Thank you for listening,” were the avatar’s final words. “Thank you for making room for me.” * * * Avatar 2 set out to investigate how effective the therapy could be when delivered by therapists with far less experience than Ward and Craig. Some of the participants had been living with voices for decades. Claire was in her early 50s when she enrolled in Avatar 2, at the Manchester research site. She had heard the first voice when she was 10: an adult male, casually telling her to jump out of her bedroom window. It was entirely real to her, external and authoritative, “like an adult telling me what to do”. Claire had been abused from the age of seven. She grew up in a state of constant hypervigilance. The nasty voice, the one that told her she was a stupid bitch, arrived when she was 13. “I remember saying, ‘Oh, shut up,’ out loud, and the other girls laughed and said, ‘There’s no one there!’ And then I realised I had to be quiet about them.” The voices became one among many secrets Claire kept, alongside the abuse and her self-harm. She spent much of her adult life in psychiatric hospitals. By the time her mental health team’s care coordinator told her about the Avatar 2 trial in 2021, Claire had tried to end her life many times. She had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression and, at one point, schizoaffective disorder. She was taking antidepressants, mood stabilisers and tranquillisers, as well as antipsychotics; she had tried CBT, cognitive analytic therapy, compassion-focused therapy and group survivor therapy. Still the voices persisted. “The state I was in at the time, I thought, they’re not going to accept me on the trial – I’m too unstable,” Claire told me. But she was given a place on the trial, coordinated by Hannah Ball. Ball had only qualified as a psychologist a year before she was trained to deliver avatar therapy. She was assigned to be Claire’s therapist. “Hannah reassured me that nobody had ever had a crisis because of avatar therapy, and I thought, that will be me. I’ll be the first one,” Claire said. Claire chose to make an avatar out of the first voice, which she felt shaped all the others. While she and Ball were putting together its angular male face, with its dark eyes and spiky hair that made Claire laugh because it wasn’t quite right, the voices over her right shoulder were enraged: “Don’t do this, you stupid fucking bitch.” The avatar’s northern accent was also not quite right, but there was something about its menacing tone that jolted Claire. As soon as she heard it, it was real to her. She felt dizzy and sick in her first session, and Ball had to constantly check in to provide reassurance in her own voice. The dialogue lasted barely 10 minutes and left Claire exhausted, but as she walked home, she was smiling: she had been able to stand up to her voices for the first time in her life. Between sessions, she listened to the audio recordings that Ball had given her to take home, so she could remember what she had achieved and steel herself for her next encounter. (Claire agreed to share these recordings with me.) By the third week, she was answering back to the avatar, asserting herself without any prompting from her therapist. “Stop saying such nasty things to me. I’m not going to listen to you any more while you say such nasty things,” she told the avatar. “I’m not sure what’s got into you,” it replied. “I’m going to lay down some rules,” Claire said. “We can still talk, but on my terms, not yours.” By the fourth week, Claire’s voices had gone entirely. For the first time in 40 years, she was alone with her own thoughts. Quiet. She hadn’t expected them to go. “My aim wasn’t to get rid of them – just to get along with them,” she told me. “I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to let go. I’d never really been on my own. As abusive as it was, it’s still a relationship.” Like Joe, she had been encouraged to understand her voices as a faulty self-defence mechanism. They had been trying to look after her: when they told her to end her life, they were trying to find a way to stop her suffering. Their departure was a kind of bereavement. In the remaining sessions, Ball helped Claire accept the loss of the voices, and she had an opportunity to say a definitive goodbye. The avatar promised to stay alongside her at a distance, there if needed, but no longer interfering in her life. “I wish you all the best,” it said at the end of the final session. “Thank you. I wish you all the best, too,” Claire replied. “I know you had good intentions at heart.” Nearly two years on, Claire’s voices have not returned. She’s coming off all her medications. She can go out in public, eat in a noisy restaurant, do voluntary work, give interviews to a journalist – all things that once seemed impossible. “I’m stronger. I’ve gained so much. I now feel I have a life worth living.” Ball didn’t have the same level of experience as Leff, Craig or Ward, but she was able to achieve the same outcomes using the manual they developed as her guide. I asked to see the manual, but Ward told me he couldn’t share it with me, because it was “core IP”. The Wellcome Trust, which funds the trial, has been protective of its intellectual property in the past: research teams in Denmark, Australia and Canada that have been experimenting with avatars have been told there are restrictions around calling the work “avatar therapy”. Ball told me the manual is not a script, more a set of objectives to aim for in each session: a general structure of how the avatar should change to empower the patient. She listened to recordings of one of Ward’s cases from the first trial, did two closely supervised pilot cases and was then delivering the therapy herself, alone. I wondered how comfortable she felt, taking on the role of a malevolent entity that has enormous power over her patient. “It requires a lot of active formulation and reformulation on the spot, and listening out for things that might change how you were initially going to approach a dialogue,” she said. I had imagined that only skilled clinicians could be avatar therapists, but Ball was convinced that, if they were willing to take on the challenge, a very wide range of mental health practitioners could do it. “I think you need people who understand relationships and dynamics,” she said. “If you’ve got a sense of who you are as the avatar and the relationship [to the patient], you know how to respond.” * * * The results of the Avatar 2 trial, published on Monday, were dramatic. Avatar therapy has been shown to deliver rapid and significant reduction in distress caused by voices. No other psychological intervention has been shown to cause such a significant reduction in the frequency of intrusive voices. Earlier this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence announced that it has found avatar therapy to be safe and effective and recommended that it be offered for testing in clinical NHS settings over the next three years. Thirty-eight people have so far been trained to deliver it in the UK, from experienced clinicians to newly qualified psychologists and nurses. The most effective psychological therapy currently offered on the NHS, CBTp, is typically delivered by qualified clinical psychologists in 16 sessions over 12 months. In comparison, avatar therapy could work out as “half the length of time, with less skilled people, so a bit cheaper, and a bit more available”, Tom Craig told me. He hopes it will be part of NHS treatment within five years. A small number of practitioners remain hesitant about avatar therapy being delivered by support workers and less experienced psychologists. Prof Neil Thomas, director of the Voices clinic in Melbourne, and lead investigator on the Australian Amethyst avatar therapy trial, said: “Working with people who hear voices is already an area of specialist practice. Using technology as well makes it even more specialist. The process is actually not particularly intuitive for people that have trained in therapy – which involves being supportive to people – to have to role play a nasty voice.” But the British team are taking things even further. A newly announced Avatar 3 trial will investigate whether the avatar could be entirely digital and voiced by an artificial intelligence, which would remove the requirement for real-time human voicing of the avatar, and mean it could be widely disseminated. Humans would always be necessary to support the person in their interaction with the avatar and help make meaning of the voices, Craig said, but that would not need to be a trained therapist. It could be “a community nurse, or a nursing assistant”. Louise Birkedal Glenthøj, associate professor of psychology at University of Copenhagen and the trial coordinator for Challenge, the Danish trial using avatars in the treatment of psychosis, told me she feared a fully digital avatar powered by AI might have the potential to exacerbate psychosis. “As people with psychosis struggle with grasping reality,” she said, “being in a dialogue with a machine that is not controlled by a therapist might generate psychotic experiences.” The Danish team enrolled 270 participants in a trial that investigated how people who hear voices respond to having dialogues with an avatar using virtual reality. “We thought if [we could] integrate this in fully immersive VR, then we would perhaps get some additional benefit in terms of this potentially having a greater treatment effect,” Glenthøj told me. “Having the therapist close by would intuitively be more secure for the patient. We capitalise on this notion of ‘it’s real but it’s not real’. It’s so real that they feel they are in this dialogue with their voice, but it’s not real, and if they take off the headset, then it’s gone.” The VR allows the user to situate the avatar in daily life settings, such as on the bus, or in the participant’s home. They also added emotions to the face, so the avatar could smile more and look more friendly as the dialogues progress. Glenthøj conceded that VR avatar therapy can be overwhelming for some. “We do see people reacting. They destabilise. They get more psychotic.” As a result, the Danish team progressed more slowly than clinicians on the Avatar 2 trial, and have added safety features, such as a virtual panic button, and regular contact with the participants’ primary care providers throughout treatment. They also gave participants booster sessions at three and six months after treatment, in the hope of making any positive effects more durable. The trial ultimately found that VR avatar therapy was significantly more effective at reducing voices compared with supportive counselling. Avatar therapy may help in treating mental health conditions beyond psychosis. Preliminary research from Ward’s team with an avatar embodying the “anorexic voice” has shown it to be a promising intervention for eating disorders. Glenthøj is researching VR-based avatar therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder. Ward also wants to investigate whether dialogues with avatars could help people who struggle with anxiety or depression. “The technology is about creating this external representation of the dark side of yourself,” Craig said. “At some level, this is about thoughts, isn’t it?” In Australia, avatar therapy can take place via telehealth, with therapist and participant often in different parts of the country. “We’ve got a lot of people living in regional areas who have limited access to mental healthcare – let alone to specialist therapies,” Thomas told me. They have drawn on how the British team worked during lockdown to see how it can be delivered remotely. Some therapists have tried, in the past, to guide their patients through dialogue with voices via role play, or “chair work” – where the voices are represented by an empty chair with content spoken by the patient – but both these techniques require a leap of faith. With an avatar, it’s the recreation of the voice, not the face, that makes this radical, Thomas said. “It’s called avatar therapy, and that sounds like it’s primarily about the visual representation, but not everyone has an existing image that goes with their voice. I think the auditory transformation is particularly powerful.” “The suspension of disbelief is remarkable,” Craig told me. Even though trial participants have signed consent forms and know it is the therapist voicing the avatar, they still relate to it as if it were the voice in their head. “They are put in front of this not very wonderful computer animation, and they’re right in there, talking to their voice.” * * * ‘It was liberating just to talk to Tom [Ward] about it, because I didn’t speak to anyone else,” Joe told me over coffee in south London. He still had the imposing presence of a rugby player, but he was so softly spoken that I had to strain to hear him talk over the hubbub of the cafe. A year on from avatar therapy, Joe’s voice was still there, a presence just out of eyeshot, still a distinct external entity and not just an inner monologue. But it was quieter, easier to manage and allowed him to get on with daily life. When it spoke, it was to have the same kind of conversations they’d had in his final sessions with the avatar. “I get it – you’re very on edge,” Joe would tell his voice. “I don’t feel great either. But we are just walking to work at the moment. I promise, we’re good.” “It worked because I understood the voices more, I think,” he told me. “My general levels of anxiety stayed pretty high, but I’ve started interpreting the hallucinations as a part of the anxiety.” He still has panic attacks. The anxiety and self-doubt that existed before his bad trip are still there. “You do have to address everything that’s going on to address the voices themselves. They feed on everything else.” Joe recently went back to his GP in search of help with his anxiety, but there was no cutting-edge experimental solution delivered by renowned psychologists for him this time. The GP put him on a waiting list for NHS talking therapy, and warned that he could be in for a very long wait.

                    "bodyText": "Hardcore gardeners sometimes, when no one else is listening, talk quietly to their prize blooms. But at next year’s Chelsea flower show, visitors will be encouraged to have a chat with its first ever AI-powered garden. The garden designer Tom Massey has partnered with Microsoft to create the Avanade “intelligent” garden. Sensors in the soil are partnered with an AI trained on Royal Horticultural Society plant data and gardening advice, meaning visitors can ask the garden: “How are you?” Massey said: “It could answer: I need a bit more water, I can do with a haircut, maybe.” As well as making gardening easier and more fun, Massey said it could have wider applications. The wireless sensors hidden in the soil measure moisture, nutrient levels, acidity and alkalinity. These will connect to a computer in a pavilion in the garden, which people will be able to consult to see how the garden is doing. “It’s supposed to be interactive,” Massey said. “It’s supposed to be showcasing this really kind of new emerging technology, and also saving resources.” He said the simple sensor technology could be rolled out across large estates, so rather than having automatic watering systems which switch on depending on the time, the plants are only watered when the soil moisture drops below a certain level. “We are wasting so much water and London is at risk of running out of water in coming years,” he said. “Imagine how much water you could save in a big development if you only use water when needed. Irrigation systems come on at a regular time to water, whether it’s needed or not.” The garden itself would not be futuristic in its design, he said. “We wanted it to feel green and organic and earthy.” It will feature mushrooms as well as climate-resilient trees, which will be monitored by an AI assistant, and lots of peaceful green planting. The RHS has adapted its system to be as energy efficient as possible. Jon Simpson, the society’s director of IT, said: “With AI, you do have the question of, does it consume more energy using data centres, so yes it can be detrimental but it’s about how you use it. What we are doing is training more traditional AI models against the RHS database, which is basically called a small language model, which is far more efficient and effective.”"

                    "bodyText": "Closing Summary This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can read our US elections coverage here. Here are the major developments from today: Kamala Harris attended a CNN town hall with undecided voters in Pennsylvania while her opponent Donald Trump held a rally in Georgia after rejecting an offer to participate in the town hall. At the town hall, Harris repeatedly returned to news that Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly claimed his one-time boss “falls into the general definition of fascist”. Harris herself called Trump a fascist when asked if she believed the ex-president qualifies as one during the town hall. Speaking from her residence in Washington DC earlier in the day, Harris accused Trump of seeking to subvert the independence of the military. A former model told the Guardian that Donald Trump groped her at his Manhattan tower in 1993, after she was introduced to the real estate mogul by notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Stacey Williams said Trump put his hands “all over my breasts” as well as her waist and buttocks in their brief meeting, unwanted touching that left her “deeply confused”. The Harris-Walz campaign announced that Harris will deliver a major “closing argument” address next week in the same location that Donald Trump rallied January 6 rioters before they stormed the US Capitol in 2021. According to a senior campaign official, Harris will speak at the Ellipse on 29 October – exactly one week before the 5 November election. The justice department warned Elon Musk’s Pac that paying people to register to vote violates federal law, just days after Musk pledged to give away $1m a day to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign a petition by his America Pac in support of the first and second amendments. A new report from Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center detailed steps that Chinese operatives have taken to discredit Republican members of Congress and that Russian agents are taking to undermine the Harris-Walz campaign. Meanwhile, the justice department announced updates in four cases brought by its Election Threats Task Force today, sending a stern message one week before the 5 November presidential election. On the first day of early voting in Wisconsin, Tim Walz called Elon Musk a “dipshit” while Barack Obama said of Donald Trump: “You’d be worried if Grandpa was acting like this.” A campaign event that saw Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Lucas Kunce shoot an AR-15 went awry, after a reporter was hit by a bullet fragment. Kamala Harris has concluded her appearance on CNN’s town hall. Over the course of the evening, Harris avoided giving direct answers to several questions (calling Donald Trump’s plan to build a border wall “stupid”, for example, but then declining to commit to not building any more wall herself) instead seeking to define her opponent as dangerous. Immediately following the town hall, CNN commentators noted that “she focused a lot more on Donald Trump, I think it’s fair to say, than she did on many specifics in terms of what she would do as president.” The Trump campaign has responded to Kamala Harris saying she thinks Donald Trump is a fascist during the ongoing CNN town hall. Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has told the Associated Press, “Kamala will say anything to distract from her open border invasion and record high inflation.” Donald Trump has concluded his rally in Duluth, Georgia, while Kamala Harris continues answering questions from undecided voters at a live CNN town hall in Pennsylvania. In Georgia, Trump delivered a characteristically rambling speech, joined by former independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr and former representative Tulsi Gabbard. Meanwhile, Harris answered questions from voters on the economy, abortion, immigration, the war in Gaza, support for Israel and how she will distinguish herself from Joe Biden. Harris suggested she would look into eliminating the filibuster to pass reproductive rights protections, called for comprehensive immigration reform and criticized Trump for declining to appear at the town hall. Asked the classic interview question, to identify one of her greatest weaknesses, Harris said: “I may not be quick to have the answer as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue sometimes, because I’m going to want to research it, I’m going to want to study it.” She added: “I’m kind of a nerd sometimes.” The Pennsylvania supreme court ruled today that voters should be allowed to cast their ballots in person if their mail-in ballots are rejected for certain reasons. The decision is a loss for the Republican National Committee, which appealed the case to the state’s highest court, and could allow thousands of Pennsylvanians to vote if their mail-in ballots are disqualified for lacking “secrecy envelopes”. The court ruled 4-to-3 that the Butler county board of elections must allow voters to cast provisional ballots in Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state where voters could determine the outcome of the 2024 election. Kamala Harris has taken the stage at a live town hall with undecided voters in Pennsylvania, and is emphasizing recent comments from prior Trump administration officials saying the ex-president has authoritarian tendencies. “I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable and unfit to serve,” Harris said. “The people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, his national security adviser, former secretaries of defense and his vice-president, have all called him unfit and dangerous. They have said explicitly he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States.” In response to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asking her: “Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?”, Harris answered: “Yes, I do.” With Donald Trump still speaking at his rally in Duluth, Georgia, Kamala Harris is about to take the stage for a live town hall with undecided Pennsylvania voters on CNN. Trump was invited to attend the same town hall but declined. The justice department announced updates in four cases brought by its Election Threats Task Force today, sending a stern message one week before the 5 November presidential election. The updates involved the charging and sentencing of four men – in Colorado, Alabama, Florida and Pennsylvania – for threats directed at elections officials spanning from 2019 to this year. This week, Richard Glenn Kantwill of Tampa, Florida, was charged for allegedly threatening an elected official in February (Kantwill was already facing charges from 2019 and 2020), while John Pollard of Philadelphia was charged with threatening to kill a Pennsylvania elected official in September. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Teak Brockbank pleaded guilty today to threatening Colorado and Arizona elections officials between September 2021 and July 2024. And, in Alabama, Brian Jerry Ogstad was sentenced to 30 months in prison for threatening election workers in Phoenix in 2022. For more on the rising rates of violence against election officials, consider Sam Levine’s reporting: Donald Trump has taken the stage in Duluth, Georgia, escalating his personal insults against Kamala Harris. “This woman is crazy,” the former president said of the vice-president. He said voters should stand up to Harris and tell her: “‘You’re the worst ever. There’s never been anybody like you. You can’t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.’” He also said that in her recent interview with CBS, she “gave an answer that was from a loony bin”. Trump has been facing scrutiny over his vicious attacks on Harris’s intelligence, which have played into racist tropes. His rally comes amid growing criticism surrounding reports that he repeatedly praised Hitler and said he wanted generals who would display loyalty in a manner similar to Nazi commanders. Georgia election officials say the state fended off a cyberattack against the state’s absentee ballot website, which they believe originated from a foreign country, CNN reports. “It slowed our systems down for a little bit, but it never stopped our systems from working,” Gabe Sterling, an official in Georgia’s secretary of state’s office, told CNN. The attack had “the hallmarks of a foreign power or a foreign entity [acting] at the behest of a foreign power,” Sterling added. Georgia’s secretary of state’s office repelled the attack, and there was no disruption to voters’ ability to request absentee ballots. It’s a pattern we’ve seen again and again since 2016: no matter what Donald Trump says or is reported to have said, powerful Republicans refuse to condemn him. The latest example came today from New Hampshire’s Republican governor Chris Sununu, who was asked on CNN about John Kelly’s condemnation of the former president, and the story of him asking for generals like those who served under Adolf Hitler. Here’s what Sununu said: We expect to hear from Donald Trump in about 10 minutes, when he is scheduled to take the stage in what looks to be a packed arena in Duluth, Georgia. The former president’s speeches are more freewheeling and random than ever these days, but don’t be surprised to hear him condemn his ex-White House chief of staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times yesterday that he believes Trump is a fascist. As for the allegations of groping brought against him by Stacey Williams, his campaign has denied them, but we will be looking out for any comments he makes. And, of course, Trump will undoubtedly say plenty about undocumented immigrants and inflation, the two issues he has put at the center of his campaign. Donald Trump has faced allegations of unwanted touching stretching as far back as the 1970s, the Guardian’s Edward Helmore reports: Donald Trump sexual abuse accuser Jessica Leeds says she ruefully “laughed out loud” when the former president recently disputed her sworn testimony that he grabbed her, tried to kiss her and ran his hand up her skirt on a plane in the 1970s by insisting “she would not have been the chosen one”. “He assaulted me 50 years ago and continues to attack me today,” Leeds said alongside her attorneys during a press conference in New York on Monday. “It was like he had 47 arms – like an octopus, but not a sound was spoken.” Her remarks came after Trump appeared at an appeal hearing on the sexual abuse case brought by E Jean Carroll, which resulted in a jury finding Trump liable of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. Leeds, 82, came forward in 2016 and later testified in the Carroll trial, which centered on Carroll’s testimony that the Republican nominee in November’s election had assaulted her at a department store in the 1990s. That set the stage for Trump to go into a lengthy rebuttal of both Carroll and Leeds. With respect to Leeds, Trump said it was a “totally made-up story” that “never happened”, and he insinuated that she supported Democrats. “And frankly – I know you’re going to say it’s a terrible thing to say – but it couldn’t have happened. It didn’t happen. And she would not have been the chosen one.” Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt denied Stacey Williams’ allegation of unwanted touching by Donald Trump. She said: These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign. Stacey Williams’ allegation that Donald Trump groped her is the latest instance of the former president being accused of inappropriately touching women without their consent. As our story notes: About two dozen women have accused the former president and convicted felon of sexual misconduct dating back decades. The allegations have included claims of Trump kissing them without their consent, reaching under their skirts, and, in the case of some beauty pageant contestants, walking in on them in the changing room. A former model named Amy Dorris shared allegations about Trump similar to what Williams described in an interview with the Guardian in 2020. Trump denied ever having harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris. Last year, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the columnist E Jean Carroll in 1996 and awarded her $5m in a judgment. Trump has been appealing the judgment in the E Jean Carroll case, but a federal judge recently sounded skeptical: Stacey Williams’ allegation of groping by Donald Trump is a reminder of how close he once was with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has claimed that they had a falling out and had not spoken in 15 years around the time of his death in 2019, but up to the early 2000s, the real estate mogul spoke highly of Epstein. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” Here’s more, from the Guardian’s story detailing Williams’s allegation, on their relationship: No evidence has surfaced that Trump was aware of or involved in Epstein’s misconduct. But Trump and Epstein knew each other for decades and were photographed at the same social events in the 1990s and early 2000s, years before Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to state charges of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” After Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, Trump told journalists in the Oval Office that he “knew him, like everybody in Palm Beach knew him” but that he had a “falling out” with Epstein in the early 2000s. “I haven’t spoken to him in 15 years,” Trump said. “I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.” Asked whether she had considered coming forward in the past, as other women were making allegations against Trump, Williams said she was a person who wanted to avoid negative attention or risk the backlash many other survivors have faced. “I left the business,” she said. “I disappeared on purpose because I love being anonymous and I love my life of being a private citizen. Then I watched what has happened to women who come out and it is so horrifying and abusive. The thought of doing that, especially as a mother with a child in my house, was just not possible,” she told the Guardian. “I just chose in my own way – comments on social media to contradict people who said he didn’t do anything,” she said. Former model Stacey Williams also shed more light on the relationship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offenses and killed himself in prison in 2019. Williams briefly dated Epstein, and knew Trump as his friend. “It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,” Williams said. One day in 1993, Epstein suggested stopping by Trump Tower while on a walk with Williams, and was present when the real estate mogul groped her, she said. Here’s what she said happened: Moments after they arrived, she alleges, Trump greeted Williams, pulled her toward him and started groping her. She said he put his hands “all over my breasts” as well as her waist and her buttocks. She said she froze because she was “deeply confused” about what was happening. At the same time, she said, she believed she saw the two men smiling at each other. … After the alleged incident, Williams said that she and Epstein left Trump Tower, and that she began to feel Epstein growing angry at her. “Jeffrey and I left and he didn’t look at me or speak to me and I felt this seething rage around me, and when we got down to the sidewalk, he looked at me and just berated me, and said why did you do that?” she said on the Zoom call. “He made me feel so disgusting and I remember being so utterly confused,” she said. She described how the alleged incident seemed to her to be part of a “twisted game”. “I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways, I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me. And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat,” she said in an interview with the Guardian. A former model has told the Guardian that Donald Trump groped her at his Manhattan tower in 1993, after she was introduced to the real estate mogul by notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Stacey Williams said Trump put his hands “all over my breasts” as well as her waist and buttocks in their brief meeting, unwanted touching that left her “deeply confused”. Here is the just-released story by the Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Lucy Osborne: Donald Trump has assailed John Kelly as a “a bad general” gripped by “pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred” after his former White House chief of staff called the ex-president a fascist. Kelly, a former general in the Marine corps, made the comment in an interview with the New York Times yesterday, which Kamala Harris seized on today as the latest evidence that Trump is seeking “unchecked power”. Writing on Truth Social, Trump laid into Kelly: Thank you for your support against a total degenerate named John Kelly, who made up a story out of pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred! This guy had two qualities, which don’t work well together. He was tough and dumb. The problem is his toughness morphed into weakness, because he became JELLO with time! The story about the Soldiers was A LIE, as are numerous other stories he told. Even though I shouldn’t be wasting my time with him, I always feel it’s necessary to hit back in pursuit of THE TRUTH. John Kelly is a LOWLIFE, and a bad General, whose advice in the White House I no longer sought, and told him to MOVE ON! His wife once told me, at Camp David, John admires you tremendously, and when he leaves the Military, he will only speak well of you. I said, Thank you! We’re going to be hearing even more from Donald Trump later this evening, when he speaks before a packed rally in suburban Atlanta. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports, former independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is among the warm-up acts, and is downplaying the recent comments from John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, who described him as a fascist: A new report from Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center details steps that Chinese operatives have taken to discredit Republican members of Congress and that Russian agents are taking to undermine the Harris-Walz campaign. Microsoft found a series of videos and social media posts targeting Representative Barry Moore of Alabama, Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida – three of the most vocal Republican critics of China. “While not always resulting in high levels of engagement, these efforts demonstrate China’s sustained attempts influence US politics across the board,” Clint Watts, who heads the Threat Analysis Center, wrote in a post accompanying the report. Meanwhile, Microsoft also found that Russian actors had continued creating AI-enhanced deepfake videos about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. “While most of these videos received minimal engagement, they underscore Russia’s ongoing use of both traditional and AI-generated content to influence US audiences and stoke political discord,” Watts added. “We have also seen some actors shifting their content publishing strategy from Telegram to X to reach US. audiences.” The news came the same day that the Washington Post reported that a former Florida sheriff is aiding the Kremlin in its efforts to spread misinformation and deepfakes about Harris. Kamala Harris will deliver a major “closing argument” address next week in the same location that Donald Trump rallied January 6 rioters before they stormed the US Capitol in 2021. According to a senior campaign official, Harris will speak at the Ellipse, a public park just south of the White House, on 29 October – exactly one week before the 5 November election. The vice-president is expected to emphasize her New Way Forward campaign, and call on voters to move past the chaos and division of the Trump era. The campaign’s decision to hold a “closing argument” address harkens back to Harris’s history as a prosecutor – who is now taking her case to the “jury”, or American voters. Following news that the owner of the Los Angeles Times had prohibited the paper from endorsing a presidential candidate, the editorials editor resigned today. The editorial board had planned to endorse Kamala Harris. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,” Mariel Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” The paper’s owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, told the editorial board that the paper would not endorse a candidate on 11 October. By then, Garza had already drafted a proposed editorial endorsing Harris on behalf of the board. Supporters of Kamala Harris are gathering at a rally in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Hallandale Beach, Florida, for an early evening speech by her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff. It’s a rare foray into the Sunshine state by a principal in her campaign. Harris trails Trump by about six points in a state he won in both 2016 and 2020, and Democrats privately concede the Republican is in line for its 30 electoral college votes this time too. Much of Emhoff’s time in recent days has been spent in more competitive states such as Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But the US Senate race between incumbent the Republican Rick Scott and her Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is a closer affair, with Scott leading by about three points. Emhoff is expected to address Florida’s draconian six-week abortion ban, the overturning of which in a ballot initiative called amendment 4 has become a central plank of her campaign. Mucarsel-Powell is among this evening’s speakers. Emhoff will follow his appearance here with a fundraising event and rally in Coral Gables, Florida, tonight before returning to stump for the vice-president in the battleground states. With election day less than two weeks away, a top House Democrat is warning that Donald Trump has failed to engage with customary presidential transition procedures. Representative Jamie Raskin, the leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Donald Trump and JD Vance today warning that the two are “breaking the precedent set by every other presidential candidate since 2010” by not signing the memorandum of understanding that typically governs the transition of power. The memorandum of understanding triggers government transition funding and planning assistance, which allows nominees to access office space and equipment, information technology and staff assistance. In the letter, Raskin wrote that Trump’s refusal to sign the documents “may be at least partially driven by your intent to circumvent fundraising rules that put limits on private contributions on the transition effort and require public reporting. You may also be acting out of a more general aversion to ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest in the incoming administration.” In a press release, the House Oversight Committee added that Trump’s failure to sign the documents “is particularly troubling in light of the fact that he has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power”. Police have arrested two men for fomenting election-related violence in Colorado and Arizona. Last night, Tempe police arrested Jeffrey Michael Kelly for allegedly shooting at Democratic party offices in Tempe, Arizona, in September and October. Meanwhile, a Colorado man named Teak Ty Brockbank pleaded guilty today to transmitting interstate threats, for making online threats about killing elected officials in Colorado and Arizona. Kelly was charged with seven felony counts and three misdemeanor counts, including terrorism and unlawful discharge, the Arizona Republic reports. Arizona Mirror reporter Jerod MacDonald-Evoy adds that police found 120 guns and 250,000 rounds of ammunition in Kelly’s home. Charges against Brockbank, meanwhile, were brought by the justice department’s Election Threats Task Force over threats Brockbank made in 2021 and 2022, including calling for elections officials to be hanged. Brockbank will be sentenced in February. Kamala Harris has told NBC News that she’s preparing for the possibility that Donald Trump will declare victory before the election is complete. “We will deal with election night and the days after as they come, and we have the resources and the expertise and the focus on that,” she said. Speaking at a Believers and Ballots town hall in Zebulon, Georgia, today, Donald Trump praised tech mogul Elon Musk for providing hurricane relief where he says the federal government did not. The former president has returned to his scapegoating of immigrants, saying that the federal government would have more funds for hurricane relief if it were not supporting non-citizens. “You know who did help us though? Elon Musk,” he said. After Hurricane Helene hit, he said: “They needed Starlink badly in North Carolina.” Trump added that Musk “saved a lot of lives”. False information has swirled in the communications blackout that followed Hurricane Helene’s devastation. Phone and power lines were down across the south, the Guardian’s Blake Montgomery reports. Musk has a history of inserting himself into rescue operations. He accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of blocking his satellite internet company, Starlink, from delivering to parts of North Carolina decimated by the hurricane, a claim both Fema and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said was false. The justice department has warned Elon Musk’s America Pac, which has donated millions of dollars to support Trump’s bid for the presidency, that paying people to register to vote violates federal law, CNN reports. Unions have vexed Democrats lately, with the Teamsters notably declining to endorse a candidate in the presidential election, after supporting Joe Biden in 2020. But the Guardian’s Michael Sainato reports that swing state members of the United Auto Workers, another important union, are on board with Harris’s candidacy: United Auto Workers (UAW) members in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada support the presidential candidate Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by 22 points, according to a poll conducted by the union. UAW members in Michigan – the center of the US auto industry – support Harris over Trump by 20 percentage points, with 54% supporting Harris over 34% supporting Trump, the poll found. The union claimed in 2020 that UAW members accounted for 84% of Joe Biden’s margin of victory in Michigan. The poll also found that support among non-college-educated men – a key demographic where Harris has been lagging – gave Harris a 14-point margin over Trump. Both Trump and Harris have courted the UAW’s members. The UAW president, Shawn Fain, has backed Harris and become a target of Trump’s ire. Biden supported the UAW in its strike against the US’s big three auto companies last year, becoming the first president to walk a picket line. The justice department has warned Elon Musk’s Pac that paying people to register to vote violates federal law, CNN reports. The billionaire behind electric car manufacturer Tesla and social media network X has stepped up his support for Donald Trump in recent months, after endorsing him following his near-assassination at a Pennsylvania rally in July. Over the weekend, he said that his America Pac would give $1m every day to a signatory of a petition that appears to be a ploy to battleground state Republicans to register to vote. Prominent Democrats, including Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, said law enforcement should investigate, which appears to have happened. Here’s what CNN reported: The Justice Department warned Elon Musk’s America PAC in recent days that his $1 million sweepstakes to registered voters in swing states may violate federal law, people briefed on the matter told CNN. Musk, who has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump and is spending millions of dollars supporting his candidacy, has publicized the $1 million prize by his political action committee aiming to increase voter registrations in hotly contested states. Musk’s initial promise to pay prizes to registered voters immediately raised concerns from election law experts and some state officials who questioned whether it ran afoul of the law. Federal law bars paying people to register to vote. The language of the petition currently promises $1 million prizes to people chosen at random for signing a petition in support of First and Second Amendment freedoms. But to sign the petition, you must be registered to vote in specific states. A letter from the Justice Department’s public integrity section, which investigates potential election-related law violations, went to Musk’s political action committee, according to people briefed on the matter. Donald Trump’s campaign has released a furious statement attacking Kamala Harris, saying the vice-president is “LYING and LOSING” and accusing her of spreading falsehoods that fueled the two assassination attempts against the former president. It comes after the vice-president warned earlier today that Trump was seeking “unchecked power” in his campaign for another four years in the White House. Here’s what Trump’s communications director Steven Cheung had to say: Kamala Harris is a stone-cold loser who is increasingly desperate because she is flailing, and her campaign is in shambles. That is why she continues to peddle outright lies and falsehoods that are easily disproven. The fact is that Kamala’s dangerous rhetoric is directly to blame for the multiple assassination attempts against President Trump and she continues to stoke the flames of violence all in the name of politics. She is despicable and her grotesque behavior proves she is wholly unfit for office. Trump may respond personally to Harris in a few minutes, when he begins his Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall in Zebulon, Georgia. At her briefing today, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Joe Biden agreed with those who say Donald Trump is a fascist. “I mean, yes,” Jean-Pierre replied, when a reporter put the question to her in the White House briefing room. She went on to argue that Trump himself has made no secret of how he would like to govern: The former president has said he is going to be a dictator on day one. We cannot ignore that … we cannot ignore or forget what happened on January 6, 2021. While the debate around UK Labour party staff volunteering to go to the United States to help campaign for the Democratic party continues, in London some expat Americans are out in the streets of English capital tonight, asking passerbys if they are American, and if they have voted yet. The dozen-strong group, some wearing T-shirts saying “Democrats abroad for Harris, Walz,” explained to me why they are so keen to reach out to their fellow compatriots in the UK, telling me that in such a tight contest for the US presidency, “Every vote counts.” With polls suggesting that the race for the presidency is pretty much neck and neck, they could well be right. Bob Casey campaign’s new attack ad against Republican Dave McCormick comes as the Pennsylvania Senate race has grown increasingly competitive in its final days, further complicating Democrats’ path to maintaining their majority in the upper chamber. While Casey had previously been favored to win re-election, the Cook Political Report recently moved his race from “lean Democrat” to “toss up”. According to the Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s polling average, Casey’s lead now stands at 3 points compared with 10 points in mid-August. Speaking to the Guardian last month, Casey acknowledged the race would be a tough fight, but he predicted Pennsylvania voters would ultimately send him back to Washington for another six years. “I think people know they have a stake in this election,” Casey said, adding, “I think it’ll be close – but I think we’re going to win.” Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, has released a new campaign ad attacking his opponent, Republican Dave McCormick, over allegations that McCormick fostered a toxic work environment as CEO of the hedge fund Bridgewater. The ad highlights claims, outlined in the book The Fund by Rob Copeland, that McCormick attempted to silence and retaliate against female employees who came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. “Reports made it clear that under Dave McCormick the world’s largest hedge fund is a dangerous place for women to work,” the narrator of the Casey ad says. “They were groped, sexually harassed or worse. But instead of protecting his female employees, McCormick protected his profits.” The ad specifically cites claims that McCormick told one employee who had been harassed that she would “be in litigation for the rest of her life” if she spoke out. The Fund also recounts numerous complaints of gender pay discrimination among female employees of Bridgewater. The Casey ad concludes: “That’s ugly. That’s Dave McCormick.” Former national security adviser John Bolton has come to former White House chief of staff John Kelly’s defense after the latter said that Donald Trump “prefers the dictator approach to government”. In an interview with CNN, Bolton, a former Trump ally turned critic, said: The campaign has attacked John’s credibility. In any comparison of what John Kelly might say versus what Donald Trump might say about a particular event or what these munchkins on the Trump campaign are saying about John Kelly, you can take what John says to the bank. I didn’t hear many, probably most of these statements myself, but if John says that Donald Trump said them, I believe it implicitly. Bolton added: Certainly this recitation of what he’s done should be compelling to people not to vote for Trump. Trump … after leaving office, said it publicly, he would suspend the constitution or terminate it because of the unfairness, the effort to steal the 2020 election. That statement alone, if he said nothing else, if he never mentioned the words ‘Adolf Hitler’, that alone is disqualifying, in my point of view.” Earlier today, the Atlantic reported that Trump allegedly said that he wanted the kind of generals that Adolf Hitler had. Donald Trump has furiously accused the UK’s Labour party of interfering in the US election, calling it ‘far left’, after party activists travelled to campaign for his opponent. The Guardian’s Jonathan Freedland and Michael Safi report: Tim Walz headed to the voting booth on Wednesday in St Paul, Minnesota, to cast his early ballot along with his wife, Gwen, and son, Gus. After he voted, Walz said: Beautiful Minnesota day, super exciting. Cast my vote for Kamala Harris, [Democratic senator] Amy Klobuchar, [Democratic representative] Betty McCollum and to have my son with me, Gus, to vote for the first time, exciting. An opportunity to turn the page on the chaos of Donald Trump and a new way forward … Look, Donald Trump made it very clear that this election is about Donald Trump taking full control of the military to use against his political enemies, taking full control of the Department of Justice to prosecute those who disagree with him, taking full control of the media on what is told and what is told to the American public … The opportunity here, and the absolute requirement of Americans, is to understand that this rhetoric has not been used in this country, certainly not by a party’s presidential nominee, and the opportunity here is to elect Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris’s surprise speech from her Washington DC residence represented the vice-president’s latest attempt to achieve a decisive advantage over Donald Trump with less than two weeks to go until election day. Speaking before she set off for the Philadelphia suburbs to take part in a CNN town hall with undecided voters, Harris seized on Trump’s recent comments, as well as those of his former chief of staff John Kelly, to persuade voters that he would be more dangerous than ever in a second term. She noted that over the past week, Trump has described his political adversaries as “the enemy from within” and publicly mulled sending the military after them. Referencing reporting that came out today from the Atlantic, Harris said: “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans.” “Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there and no longer be there to rein him in,” Harris continued. “So, the bottom line is this: we know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be, what do the American people want?” the vice-president said. She left without responding to a question from a reporter who appeared to ask about Joe Biden yesterday saying Trump should be locked up. It’s not the first time that Harris and other Democrats have warned the voting public that Trump is a threat, and is certain not to be the last, but if it will work is another question. While Harris’s entry into the race in July was greeted with an outpouring of Democratic enthusiasm and a bump in her polls compared to Biden, more recent surveys show her neck-in-neck, and in some places trailing, Trump, both in swing states and nationally. Theories abound as to what she could do to turn voters away from Trump’s appeal, which has centered on vows to lower prices that rose during Biden’s presidency and throw migrants out of the country. In an interview earlier today on CNN, noted Republican pollster Frank Luntz said that the very sort of message Harris pushed this afternoon was not working. “What’s interesting is that [when] Harris focused on why she should be elected president, that’s when the numbers grew,” Luntz said. “And then the moment that she turned anti-Trump and focused onto him and said, don’t vote for me, vote against him, that’s when everything froze.” Speaking for her residence in Washington DC, Kamala Harris accused Donald Trump of seeking to subvert the independence of the military, citing comments made by his former chief of staff and retired marine corps general John Kelly. “Yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had,” Harris said. “Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States constitution. He wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal to him, personally, one that will obey his orders, even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the constitution of the United States.” We’re going to be hearing from Kamala Harris today quite a bit earlier than expected, when she delivers remarks from her Washington DC residence at 1pm, in an appearance that was not previously scheduled. The vice-president then heads to the Philadelphia suburbs for a town hall with undecided voters at 9pm, while Donald Trump has two campaign events planned today in Georgia, including a town hall with lieutenant governor and 2020 election denier Burt Jones. Meanwhile, CNN reports that Trump’s own co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, is among the many Republicans who criticized him after the January 6 Capitol attack but then made amends. In LaCivita’s case, one wonders if it wasn’t because doing so has been quite lucrative. Here’s what else has happened today so far: Retired army officers said they agreed with Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly that the former president met the definition of a fascist and would act as such if re-elected. Nate Silver and James Carville, two veteran US politics watchers, shared their thoughts on who might win the presidential election, with Silver assessing the emotions of his gut, and Carville advising Democrats not to worry. A campaign event that saw Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Lucas Kunce shoot an AR-15 went awry, after a reporter was hit by a bullet fragment. Retired US army Brig Gen Steve Anderson said it was important to not only express opposition to Trump, but to endorse Harris, who he said had the “temperament”, “intelligence” and “experience” to be the commander-in-chief. By contrast, he noted that Trump’s 34 felony convictions would disqualify him from serving in the military. Anderson said he wished Kelly would go further than he has, and publicly endorse Harris. “You are now in the political fray, regardless of whether you want to or not,” he said of Kelly. “And so you owe it to the American people that tell us not just that you oppose somebody, but you also support Kamala Harris.” “I’m frankly disappointed that John Kelly won’t come up and actually say that,” he added. Kamala Harris has just announced she will make a speech from her residence in Washington DC at 1pm. The remarks were not previously scheduled, and the White House did not say what she would talk about. Harris’s only public appearance today was to be her CNN town hall with undecided voters in Chester Township, Pennsylvania, at 9pm. Two retired US army officers urged Americans to heed John Kelly’s extraordinary public warnings about Donald Trump, the president he formerly served as chief of staff. “The only reason Trump was stopped the last time was because people like Gen Kelly stood in the breach and acted as a check to Trump’s worst impulses. A second time around, those guardrails won’t exist,” retired army reserve Col Kevin Carroll, a former Trump homeland security official and self-described conservative who is backing Harris, said on a press call organized by her campaign. In a recent New York Times interview, Kelly said Trump met the definition of a fascist and expected that he would govern like a dictator if he returned to power and surrounded himself with loyalists. He also confirmed previous reports that Trump made admiring statements about Hitler. “He’s going to want all the leaders from the [secretary of defense] all the way down to general officers and senior leaders in the military to swear to some sort of loyalty test that they’re loyalty is to him and not the constitution,” Steve Anderson, a retired US army brigadier general and a lifelong Republican, said on the call. He added: “We’re concerned that he wants to use the military to suppress his opposition in the country and man the US border, which are things that the military is not supposed to do.” There is, however, one swing state where we have more than just polling to go on when it comes to the question of which presidential candidate might win. Jon Ralston, a veteran reporter in Nevada and editor of the Nevada Independent, has been tabulating early voting data from the state, which can serve as a preview of how it might end up swinging on 5 November. So far, the GOP is performing a bit more strongly than Democrats, despite not having won Nevada in a presidential election in 20 years. But that certainly could change, and Ralston updates his blog multiple times a day. You can read it here. Underscoring the 50-50 nature of the presidential race, Monmouth University has just released new national polling that once again confirms the race for president is tied: In the words of the Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray: Presidential election polling this fall can best be characterized as stable uncertainty. Major events like an assassination attempt and a high-profile debate barely caused the needle to stutter. Shifts of a single point can be consequential to the outcome but are beyond the ability of most polls to capture with any precision. The bottom line is this race is a toss-up and has been since August. The second piece the New York Times published comes from James Carville, a veteran Democratic strategist who boldly declares that Kamala Harris is going to win the White House. “Today I am pulling my stool up to the political poker table to throw my chips all in: America, it will all be OK. Ms Harris will be elected the next president of the United States. Of this, I am certain,” Carville says. He then lists three reasons: Mr Trump is a repeat electoral loser. This time will be no different. Money matters, and Ms Harris has it in droves. It’s just a feeling. To go a little deeper into Carville’s rationale for the first bullet point, he argues that Trump has a lower ceiling in terms of voter support than Harris, and that the GOP has been on a losing streak for the past two years that is set to continue: The biggest reason Mr Trump will lose is that the whole Republican Party has been on a losing streak since Mr Trump took it over. See 2018: the largest House landslide for Democrats in a midterm election since Watergate. See 2020: He was decisively bucked from the White House by Joe Biden. See 2022: an embarrassment of a midterm for Republicans off the heels of Dobbs. And the Democrats have been performing well in special elections since Trump appointees on the Supreme Court helped take away a basic right of American women. Guess what? Abortion is on the ballot again – for president. There simply do not seem to be enough voters – even in the battleground states – who turn out at Mr Trump’s behest anymore when he’s simply preaching to his base. He has not learned from his electoral losses nor done the necessary work to assemble a broad electoral coalition in 2024. Let’s not forget that seven weeks after Nikki Haley dropped out of the Republican primary, she received 158,000 votes in Pennsylvania – and some disaffected Haley voters are currently looking to move to Ms Harris. Although Ms Haley has endorsed Mr Trump, losing even a fraction of those voters leaves Mr Trump running the final leg of this race with a fundamental fracture of the femur. To add a cherry to the pie, most voters think Mr Trump is too old to be president, but instead of easing their concerns, he’s spending the final days of the campaign jiving to the Village People and canceling interviews. The New York Times today published two separate articles from noted American politics watchers who share what their instincts tell them about the presidential race. We’ll tell you about both of them, beginning with the piece authored by polling wizard Nate Silver. He confides that “my gut says Donald Trump” will win, before noting that “I don’t think you should put any value whatsoever on anyone’s gut – including mine. Instead, you should resign yourself to the fact that a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50.” He then gets into some of the reasons why Trump may ultimately prevail: If Mr Trump does beat his polling, there will have been at least one clear sign of it: Democrats no longer have a consistent edge in party identification – about as many people now identify as Republicans. There’s also the fact that Ms Harris is running to become the first female president and the second Black one. The so-called Bradley effect – named after former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who underperformed his polls in the 1982 California governor’s race, for the supposed tendency of voters to say they’re undecided rather than admit they won’t vote for a Black candidate – wasn’t a problem for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012. Still, the only other time a woman was her party’s nominee, undecided voters tilted heavily against her. So perhaps Ms Harris should have some concerns about a ‘Hillary effect’. And why Kamala Harris may end up as our next president: A surprise in polling that underestimates Ms Harris isn’t necessarily less likely than one for Mr Trump. On average, polls miss by three or four points. If Ms Harris does that, she will win by the largest margin in both the popular vote and the Electoral College since Mr Obama in 2008. How might that happen? It could be because of something like what happened in Britain in 2017, related to the ‘shy Tories’ theory. Expected to be a Tory sweep, the election instead resulted in Conservatives losing their majority. There was a lot of disagreement among pollsters, and some did nail the outcome. But others made the mistake of not trusting their data, making ad hoc adjustments after years of being worried about ‘shy Tories’. Polls are increasingly like mini-models, with pollsters facing many decision points about how to translate nonrepresentative raw data into an accurate representation of the electorate. If pollsters are terrified of missing low on Mr Trump again, they may consciously or unconsciously make assumptions that favor him. The Guardian’s George Chidi has uncovered more offensive social media posts made by Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina. His campaign has been ailing ever since CNN reported last month that he had a history of making lewd comments on a pornography website’s message board. Here’s what else he said: Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s embattled Republican gubernatorial candidate, suggested that people who can’t take care of their children should be sterilized, according to one of a series of incendiary and racist social media posts from 2014 through 2019. The commentary made in reference to Black families, which used terms a white supremacist would find appropriate, predates his time as the state’s lieutenant governor, but much of it came after his rise as a public figure on the right. Most of the social media posts have not previously been reported. “I have more respect for loyal DOGS than I do for PEOPLE who don’t take care of their children,” Robinson wrote on his Facebook page in 2014. The post contained the hashtag “#haveyourdeadbeatsspayedandneutered”. Robinson has been in a state of damage control for the last few weeks. Last month, CNN revealed old posts made under his profile on pornographic websites, in which the conservative candidate for governor purportedly described himself as a “Black NAZI” and pined for a return to the days of slavery. Robinson has denied making the comments, castigated his detractors, attacked his opponent, attorney general Josh Stein, and launched a defamation lawsuit against CNN. But the other comments remain public on his social media page. With less than two weeks to go until the 5 November presidential election, the Guardian and the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry at Emory University are co-hosting an event in Georgia focused on the past, present and future of voting rights in the United States. That includes the swing state’s own measures making it harder to get an absentee ballot, and easier to challenge the validity of voters. Find out more about it, and how to watch it live, below: Click on over to our poll tracker and you will see a very close race between the two candidates, with Donald Trump carrying a narrow advantage in several swing states. That does not mean the former president is poised for victory – many polls show the two candidates within the margin of error in the seven states that are expected to decide the election. But it does speak to a dynamic that Harris’s campaign has struggled with in recent weeks, which is that the burst of enthusiasm and polling momentum that accompanied her entry into the race in July seems to have petered out. In an interview with CNN today, Frank Luntz, a veteran pollster known for his work with Republicans, has offered some thoughts as to why. Here’s what he said: It is heading towards Trump, but what’s interesting is that with Harris focused on why she should be elected president. That’s when the numbers grew. She’s had the best 60 days of any presidential candidate in modern history. And then the moment that she turned anti-Trump and focused onto him and said, don’t vote for me, vote against him, that’s when everything froze. And the fact is Donald Trump is defined. He’s not gaining. He’s not losing. He is who he is, and his vote is where it is. She is less well-defined, and if she continues just to define this race as vote against Trump, she’s going to stay where she is now. And she may lose. Donald Trump will today at 3pm hold a town hall with Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, who was a participant in the former president’s failed plot to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in the state four years ago. Jones avoided criminal charges for his involvement in the scheme that saw him and 15 others sign a document saying that Trump won the state’s electoral votes. In 2022, he was elected to the No 2 position in the statehouse. Trump’s campaign dubbed the event to be held in the town of Zebulon as “a Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall”. It seems like it will focus on his approach to religion, with the campaign noting that “President Trump has stood firmly for religious freedom and the protection of all religions”. An errant bullet fragment left a reporter bleeding yesterday in Missouri at a shooting event held by Lucas Kunce, the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, the Kansas City Star reports. The fragment, apparently from a bullet Kunce fired from an AR-15, struck KSHB 41 reporter Ryan Gamboa in the arm. Kunce, who is running to unseat incumbent Republican Josh Hawley, applied first aid, and Gamboa was able to continue covering the event. Here’s more, from the Star: Kunce, a Democrat, was at a private residence near Holt north of Kansas City with former US Rep[resentative] Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, when a fragment appeared to have ricocheted off a target. Kunce was shooting an AR-15 at the time, and was the only person shooting when the injury occurred. The reporter, KSHB-TV’s Ryan Gamboa, began bleeding from his arm. Kunce, who spent 13 years in the Marines, wrapped gauze and his belt around the reporter’s arm to help stop the bleeding. The wound was later wrapped with medical tape. Gamboa remained at the range and continued on his assignment. ‘You never know what’s going to happen – shrapnel can ricochet off anything, and you’ve got to be prepared,” Kunce said in a written statement. “We were able to handle the situation, and I’m grateful Ryan is okay and could continue reporting.’ The shooting range event came with two weeks until Election Day. Kunce has emphasized his military background in campaign ads, some of which show him firing a gun. As the Star notes, Kunce is badly trailing Hawley in the polls, with Emerson College Polling and the Hill last month finding the Democrat with 40% support to Hawley’s 51%. One reason why Chris LaCivita may have changed his mind about Donald Trump: working for him is very lucrative. Last week, the Daily Beast reported that LaCivita has brought in tens of millions of dollars by working for the former president over just the last two years: The co-manager of Donald Trump’s White House campaign has raked in $22 million and counting from the Republican nominee’s political operation in just two years, the Daily Beast has learned. Chris LaCivita, an influential GOP operative, reaped a $19 million financial windfall in 2022 when he served as a “strategic consultant” to two Trump-affiliated super PACs, campaign finance records show. Then, after joining the Trump campaign, he negotiated three contracts that gave his tiny LLC a generous cut of Trump’s TV and digital ads, direct mail and other campaign spending. He also collected retainers that at times amounted to $75,000 a month, according to multiple sources familiar with the campaign’s finances and campaign finance records. That has netted LaCivita’s consulting firm $3 million from the campaign, records show, and there are plans to award his firm nearly $5 million more by the time the election is over—including a $150,000 bonus if Trump wins, according to a source familiar with an informal and controversial “audit” ordered up by another campaign senior adviser, Corey Lewandowski. The campaign disputes the figure for the additional monies owed to LaCivita, but did not offer an alternative estimate. By contrast, the campaign’s other co-manager, Susie Wiles, has been paid $685,000 from the campaign through her own consulting firm with monthly retainers that ranged between $25,000 and $30,000. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Kamala Harris’ campaign manager, is paid $13,442 a month, campaign finance records show. Chris LaCivita is currently co-managing Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, but CNN reports that in the aftermath of January 6, he was among the many Republicans who condemned the attack and the then-president’s embrace of the lies that fueled it. On X, LaCivita, who these days uses the account to promote Trump’s campaign, retweeted posts that condemned the violent assault on the Capitol by his supporters: LaCivita’s shared posts included a statement on January 6 from former President George W. Bush, who expressed “disbelief and dismay” at the violent assault on the Capitol, calling it “a sickening and heartbreaking sight.” “I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,” read the statement by Bush that LaCivita shared. “The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress – was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.” The post, which was shared on the evening of January 6, was later deleted from LaCivita’s feed. CNN also reviewed a video showing a screen recording of posts that LaCivita liked on January 6, including one from Republican former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who called for Trump’s Cabinet to remove him from office via the 25th Amendment. “Twitter locked @realDonaldTrump for 12 hours. Now the Cabinet needs to lock him down for the next 14 days. #25thAmendmentNow,” Comstock wrote on the evening of January 6. Although X has since removed the ability to view likes, a user whose tweet was liked by LaCivita confirmed to CNN that his post had indeed been liked by Trump’s campaign manager on January 6. In response to CNN’s digging, LaCivita had this to say: Retweets and likes are not endorsements. I’m focused on winning the election two weeks from now, and not distractions from CNN. We will be seeing quite a bit of Tim Walz today, Kamala Harris’s running mate who has planned a blitz of interviews and as well as a stop in an unlikely state. The Harris-Walz campaign says he is set to make an unspecified appearance in St. Paul, Minnesota, the state he governs, then record interviews with television stations in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, all swing states. An interview he recorded on Univision Radio’s El Bueno, La Mala y El Feo will also air at some point this morning. This evening, Walz will head to Louisville, Kentucky, which is not at all a swing state, and deliver remarks at a campaign reception. Over the weekend, Elon Musk pledged to give away $1m a day to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign a petition by his America Pac in support of the first and second amendments. He awarded the first prize, a novelty check the size of a kitchen island, at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday and the second on Sunday in Pittsburgh. He says he’ll keep doing it until the election on 5 November. The stunt is potentially illegal, experts say. After endorsing Donald Trump in July, Musk quickly founded America Pac and funded it with $75m. For the past several weeks, he’s been making multiple in-person campaign appearances per day, focusing especially on Pennsylvania, a swing state. But, what does Musk want from all this politicking? My US colleague, Blake Montgomery, delves into this in the below explainer: In addition to worrying that the election will be rigged, now people in Saginaw county are nervous that violence will accompany it. Vanessa Guerra is resigned to questions from Donald Trump’s supporters about the many ways in which American voters imagine next month’s presidential election might be rigged against him. But more recently the Saginaw county clerk, who is overseeing the ballot in a highly contested patch of central Michigan, has faced a new line of questioning at meetings called to reassure distrustful voters. “I did a presentation last week and, as usual, we had a lot of questions about the validity of election results. But now they’re also asking: Is it going to be safe to go to the polls on election day? Is something going to happen? That’s something new,” said Guerra. The most consequential US presidential election of recent times is also likely to be the most disputed, particularly if the results are as close as opinion polls suggest. Republican officials are gearing up to stall and overturn the count if it goes against Trump. Meanwhile, the former US president has warned of a bloodbath if he loses again next month, which voters have reason to take seriously in the wake of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol after he lost the last election. Trump’s continued insistence that the 2020 vote was rigged against him – including at a rally in Saginaw earlier this month – and that Democrats are plotting to steal next month’s election, has left its mark. In Michigan, a key swing state that Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016 and then lost to Joe Biden four years later, one in five people say they do not have confidence that votes will be counted accurately. Across the US, just 8% of Trump supporters say they have a great deal of confidence there will be a fair election and only 16% are very confident that their own vote will be counted accurately, according to YouGov. Kamala Harris’s supporters are much more trusting, with 72% having a great deal of confidence in the conduct of the election, although that still leaves large numbers of Democrats also questioning the process. The Labour party has put out a statement rejecting allegations that it broke US election law because activists and staff members have been volunteering to help the Democrats. A Labour spokesperson said: It is common practice for campaigners of all political persuasions from around the world to volunteer in US elections. Where Labour activists take part, they do so at their own expense, in accordance with the laws and rules.” On the first day of early voting in Wisconsin, Tim Walz called Elon Musk a “dipshit” while Barack Obama said of Donald Trump: “You’d be worried if Grandpa was acting like this.” Both were speaking at a rally in Madison, a growing Democratic party stronghold, to encourage early voting and warn of the perils of a second Trump presidency. Obama went on to campaign for Kamala Harris in Detroit on Tuesday evening, alongside rapper Eminem, in an effort to drum up support in Michigan where polls suggest Harris and Trump are in a virtual deadlock. The Democratic vice-presidential candidate ripped into Trump ally and Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, warning that he could be charged with regulating his own businesses if Trump were elected. Musk has also promised the chance to win $1m to voters in swing states who sign a petition linked to efforts to return Trump to power. Walz also slammed Trump, who this week served meals at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, accusing him of “cosplaying” as a working-class person and noting that the restaurant had closed to accommodate the presidential candidate. “It was a stunt,” said Walz. “Fake orders for fake customers.” “He is not the 2016 Donald Trump,” said Walz, describing Trump’s promise to prosecute his political enemies. “He’s talking about sending the military against people who don’t support him. He’s naming names.” Obama, who won in Wisconsin in 2008 and 2012, urged his Madison audience to get to the polls and spent much of his speech attacking Trump. “I wouldn’t be offended if you just walk out right now and go vote,” he said. “When he’s not complaining, he’s trying to sell you stuff,” he added, referring to Trump, who has raised funds by selling gold-colored sneakers, bibles and $100,000 watches. “Who does that? You’re running for president, and you’re hawking merchandise.” Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s embattled Republican gubernatorial candidate, suggested that people who can’t take care of their children should be sterilized, according to one of a series of incendiary and racist social media posts from 2014 through 2019. The commentary made in reference to Black families, which used terms a white supremacist would find appropriate, predates his time as the state’s lieutenant governor, but much of it came after his rise as a public figure on the right. Most of the social media posts have not previously been reported. “I have more respect for loyal DOGS than I do for PEOPLE who don’t take care of their children,” Robinson wrote on his Facebook page in 2014. The post contained the hashtag “#haveyourdeadbeatsspayedandneutered”. Robinson has been in a state of damage control for the last few weeks. Last month, CNN revealed old posts made under his profile on pornographic websites, in which the conservative candidate for governor purportedly described himself as a “Black NAZI” and pined for a return to the days of slavery. Robinson has denied making the comments, castigated his detractors, attacked his opponent, the attorney general, Josh Stein, and launched a defamation lawsuit against CNN. But the other comments remain public on his social media page. “If you need a court order to tell you to take care of your children, then you probably need an operation to make sure you don’t have any more,” Robinson posted on Facebook in 2016. It was billed as a roundtable discussion with Latino leaders, but the reality of Donald Trump’s appearance at his Doral golf club in Miami on Tuesday was a succession of adulatory monologues from his most loyal Latino supporters, interspersed with familiar, lengthy rants from the former president laden with grievances and insults. Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent in the 5 November election, also courted Latino voters on Tuesday in an interview with Telemundo, touching on creating economic opportunity for Latino men. Little of Trump’s conversation, such as it was, related to issues directly affecting Latino voters, with whom Trump falsely claimed he was leading in the polls despite significant evidence to the contrary. His remarks about immigration, for example, were largely limited to baseless and often-aired claims that foreign countries, especially Venezuela, were opening their prisons to send “violent gang members” and drug dealers into the US with military weapons. And, his comments addressed to the many business owners and leaders present were distinctly light on policy, apart from a promise to maintain the generous tax cuts from his first term in office. “We gave you the biggest cut in taxes in the history of the country,” he said. “We have a great foundation to build on so we have a lot of companies coming in very fast.” Trump trails Harris in all battleground states among Latinos, a poll for Voto Latino published Monday and cited by the Hill, found, while the most recent AS/COA poll tracker shows a 56-31 preference for Harris nationally among the 36 million eligible Latino voters. Harris, in Tuesday’s Telemundo interview, emphasised the economy, saying she would work to bring more funds to community banks to help Latino men secure small business loans. “We need to construct a strong economy that supports the working class,” she said. “I know that Hispanic men often have more difficulty securing loans from banks because of their connections and the fact that things aren’t necessarily set up so that they will qualify,” she said in an interview in English that was translated into Spanish. “For that reason, I’m focused on seeing what we can do to bring more capital to community banks that better understand the community so we can give them that kind of loans.” Ahead of the upcoming presidential election, one large US bank is supplementing its global overnight team with a full trading desk in New York to handle the expected greater demand from clients, a source at the bank who is familiar with the situation has told Reuters. This bank also plans to adjust staffing needs as necessary if a presidential decision is delayed. Separately, a large retail brokerage is making sure staff are on hand to respond to investor questions around-the-clock and is keeping tabs on social media sites such as Reddit for signs of anything unexpected, a person familiar with the firms’ plans told Reuters. It has undertaken reviews of its systems to ensure they can cope with any sudden increase in either volatility or trading volume, the person, who requested anonymity to speak about his company’s plans, told the news agency. Chris Isaacson, chief operating officer at exchange operator Cboe Global Markets, said past volatility events such as the pandemic, the 2020 US election and, recently, the fallout from the yen carry trade, have tested the company’s systems. “We build our markets to be able to handle at least two times the biggest peaks we’ve ever seen. So, we feel quite good about our resiliency and business continuity leading into the election,” he said. Still, along with 24/7 staff, “we’ll have bolstered staff watching during the key hours here,” he said. A large US broker dealer is adjusting new hire training schedules and limiting any activities and meetings that take staff away from their phones, a source at the firm told Reuters. For Joe Hoffman, chief executive officer at Mesirow Currency Management in Chicago, it will be crucial to have access to relationship banking as it can be “really important during times of stress” when liquidity might dry up on the screens. Brian Hyndman, CEO of Blue Ocean Technologies LLC, whose automated trading system powers overnight trading for Robinhood and dozens of other brokerage clients, said he was prepared for increased trading and volatility, but couldn’t predict in which assets, according to Reuters. “We’ll probably have more hands on deck than in a typical overnight session to address and resolve technical issues, and more management and support staff,” said Hyndman. Banks, brokerages, investment managers and exchanges are adding staff to handle high trading volumes on and around election day with markets expected to become volatile as results come in, reports Reuters. Political events can trigger wild gyrations that can force market participants to quickly unwind bets, raising market, liquidity and other risks that could pressure trading systems and market infrastructure. With Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump neck-and-neck in many polls ahead of the 5 November vote, the prospect of no immediate winner being clear is heightening concerns among investors and traders, reports Reuters. There is also the risk of a contested election following Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss in 2020. Trump has indicated he might not accept the results of this election if he loses. This election is seen as pivotal as Harris and Trump have markedly different views on policy that could have major implications for the economy, foreign relations, markets and global trade. “We are preparing here from a market standpoint, for at least a week of uncertainty, of not knowing who that president is,” said Grant Johnsey, regional head of client solutions for Capital Markets, at Northern Trust. “This just means ensuring we have sufficient coverage to handle more volume and volatility, managing vacation schedules accordingly, and that we are prepared for intraday ups and downs as election news unfolds,” he said. Market participants are trying to make sure they are not caught off guard by surges in volatility. Recent surprises have included when the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, as well as when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton later that same year. Two weeks out from election day, Donald Trump’s former chief of staff has claimed his one-time boss “falls into the general definition of fascist”. John Kelly, a former Marine general and presidential aide from 2017 to 2019, made the extraordinary intervention on Tuesday in a series of coordinated interviews. Speaking to the New York Times, he said the former Republican president “prefers the dictator approach to government” and is the “only president that has all but rejected what America is all about”. Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, told the Times that Kelly’s accounts were “debunked stories” and that Kelly had “beclowned” himself. Speaking to the Atlantic, Kelly recounted Trump saying he wished his military personnel showed him the same deference Nazi generals showed Adolf Hitler. Trump’s campaign denied the exchange, with an adviser telling CNN: This is absolutely false. President Trump never said this.” Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz said the reported comments about Hitler’s generals “makes me sick as hell”. “Folks, the guardrails are gone,” Walz told a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday. “Trump is descending into this madness.” Barack Obama rapped Eminem’s signature hit Lose Yourself to a crowd in Detroit during a campaign rally for Kamala Harris. He was preceded by Eminem himself, who told the crowd in his home city: It’s important to use your voice, I’m encouraging everyone to get out and vote, please … I don’t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution of what people will do if you make your opinion known. I think vice-president Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.” Obama opened his ensuing speech by saying: “I gotta say, I have done a lot of rallies, so I don’t usually get nervous, but I was feeling some kind of way following Eminem,” before segueing into Lose Yourself’s opening lines: “I notice my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, vomit on my sweater already, mom’s spaghetti, I’m nervous but on the surface I look calm and ready to drop bombs but I keep on forgetting …” He joked that he thought Eminem would be performing and he would be a guest star, adding: “Love me some Eminem.” The former president is an avowed music fan, sharing his favourite songs twice a year in official posts on his social media. Summer 2024’s selections included songs by contemporary pop names such as Beyoncé, Tyla and Rema alongside older tracks by Nick Drake, the Supremes and cosmic jazz musician Pharoah Sanders. Obama went on to excoriate Donald Trump in his speech, recalling how Trump expressed doubt about the election results in 2020: Because Donald Trump was willing to spread lies about voter fraud in Michigan, protesters came down, banged on the windows, shouting, ‘Let us in. Stop the count.’ Poll workers inside being intimidated … all because Donald Trump couldn’t accept losing … there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.” He questioned Trump’s mental fitness for the role of president, saying: You’d be worried if Grandpa was acting like this. But this is coming from someone who wants unchecked power.” Keir Starmer has insisted he can maintain a “good relationship” with Donald Trump after the Republican candidate’s campaign accused Labour of “blatant foreign interference” in the US election. The Trump campaign filed a legal complaint overnight against Labour officials travelling to US battleground states to volunteer for his Democrat rival Kamala Harris. The letter, which was sent to the US Federal Election Commission, said that these volunteering efforts and reports of contact between Labour and the Harris campaign amounted to “illegal foreign national contributions”. A statement on DonaldJTrump.com on Tuesday night claimed that the “far-left” Labour party has “inspired Kamala’s dangerously liberal policies and rhetoric”. In response Starmer insisted he had a “good relationship” with Trump which would not be jeopardised by the complaint. The prime minister said that party officials volunteering for Harris ahead of the US presidential election on 5 November were “doing it in their spare time” rather than in their capacity working for Labour. Speaking to reporters travelling with him to the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, Starmer said: The Labour party … volunteers, have gone over pretty much every election. They’re doing it in their spare time, they’re doing it as volunteers, they’re staying I think with other volunteers over there. That’s what they’ve done in previous elections, that’s what they’re doing in this election and that’s really straightforward.” Asked if the complaint risked jeopardising his relationship with Trump if he becomes president again, the UK prime minister said: No. I spent time in New York with President Trump, had dinner with him and my purpose in doing that was to make sure that between the two of us we established a good relationship, which we did, and we’re grateful for him for making the time.” We had a good, constructive discussion and, of course as prime minister of the United Kingdom I will work with whoever the American people return as their president in their elections which are very close now.” US vice-president Kamala Harris will hold a town hall with undecided voters on CNN on Wednesday, after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump rejected an offer to debate the Democratic nominee for a second time, reports Reuters. Trump will headline a rally Wednesday in Duluth, Georgia with guests Tucker Carlson and Robert F Kennedy Jr, as the race for the White House counts down to less than two weeks. Pennsylvania and Georgia are among seven battleground states that will decide who wins the presidency. Both candidates are likely to spend much of the rest of their campaigns in those states, trying to persuade the small sliver of voters who are still undecided to back them in the 5 November election. Harris tried and failed to push Trump to agree to a second presidential debate on CNN after she was considered to have won the first and only presidential debate between the two candidates, which took place in September on ABC News. Reuters reports that Hariss’s televised town hall will take place before a live audience of undecided voters from Pennsylvania in Delaware County, outside Philadelphia. Harris held a marginal 46% to 43% lead over the former president, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. More on this story in a moment, but first, here are the latest updates: Surrogates campaigning for Trump and Harris are fanning out across the US this week. Harris’s vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, will travel to North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Trump’s running mate JD Vance will head to Reno, Nevada on Wednesday. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has insisted he can maintain a “good relationship” with Donald Trump after the Republican candidate’s campaign accused Labour of “blatant foreign interference” in the US election. The Trump campaign filed a legal complaint overnight against Labour officials travelling to US battleground states to volunteer for his Democrat rival Kamala Harris. Harris herself said she has no doubt that the US was ready for a female president, in an interview with NBC News’s Hallie Jackson. “I’m clearly a woman. I don’t need to point that out to anyone,” Harris said with a laugh. “The point that most people really care about is: can you do the job and, do you have a plan to actually focus on them?”. Harris courted Hispanic voters promoting small business loans for Latino men, in an interview with Noticias Telemundo’s Julio Vaqueiro. Harris pledged to drive more funds to community banks to help Latino men access small business loans. “Hispanic men often have more difficulty securing loans from banks because of their connections and the fact that things aren’t necessarily set up so that they will qualify,” she said. Trump also pitched to Hispanic voters, holding a morning round table with Latino leaders at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. Trump hit familiar talking points but took his time in getting to issues of importance to the voting bloc. The event concluded with a group of prominent evangelists praying as they stood around Trump with their hands on his shoulders, while he sat with his eyes closed. At the same event, the former president hurled a series of personal attacks at his opponent, calling Harris “lazy as hell” and “low IQ”. He was referring to Harris holding no public campaign events on Tuesday, instead recording the two interviews after a busy day of campaigning with Liz Cheney on Monday. At a later rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump continued the invective: “Does she drink? Is she on drugs?” Vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz held a rally with former president Barack Obama in Madison, Wisconsin, where he slammed Trump’s staged campaign event at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s as a “stunt” and mocked Elon Musk for “jumping around, skipping like a dipshit” before holding another rally in Wisconsin that evening. Obama, meanwhile, ridiculed Trump’s boasts on the economy and cast his rambling speeches as a sign of mental deterioration. “You’d be worried if Grandpa was acting like this,” said Obama. “But this is coming from someone who wants unchecked power.” JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, dodged a question about whether he would strip immigrants with legal authorisation of their status while campaigning in Peoria, outside Phoenix, Arizona. Vance urged supporters to “work our rear ends off for the next two weeks” to turn the swing state red. Despite some setbacks, Republicans vowed to press ahead in bids to block some overseas ballots. Court rulings rejected Republic National Committee efforts to block some Americans living abroad from voting in North Carolina and Michigan but the party will keep up its aggressive legal campaign. Arab Americans slightly favour Trump over Harris, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit along with YouGov, shows a deadlock in Michigan, a key battleground state with a large Arab American population."

                    "headline": "Tesla shares jump on third-quarter earnings even as expected revenue is lower",
                    "bodyText": "Tesla shares saw a 12% jump after the company reported its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The electric-car manufacturer was able to bounce back from a tough second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings per share. The company reported an earnings-per-share of $0.72, surpassing investors’ projection of $0.60. At the end of the second quarter, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the nearly 50% drop in profits was temporary and due to difficulty competing with cheaper or price-slashed electric vehicles by rival companies such as BYD. “We don’t see this as a long-term issue,” Musk said in July, “but really fairly short term.” Tesla came slightly under expected revenue, however. The company reported $25.18bn in revenue at the end of the third quarter, just missing Wall Street revenue projections of $25.43bn. “Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity,” the company said in a press release. “We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.” On the earnings call on Wednesday, Musk said that Tesla had had a record third quarter and believes Tesla will become the most profitable company in the world if they execute on their plans. “Tesla is focused on the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI and this is a time where others are focused on just managing on near terms,” Musk said. “We think what we’re doing is the right approach and if we execute on our objectives, and I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world, probably by a long shot.” At the moment, he says he doesn’t know of any electric vehicle manufacturer that is currently profitable. Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles at the end of the third quarter, up from 443,956 in the second quarter. Investors will be looking to hear more about whether the company is on track to match its 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8m. The company said that it expected slight growth in vehicle deliveries by the end of the year. Dan Ives, of financial services firm Wedbush Securities, remains confident. Meeting that goal will be “a solid feat given the extensive white-knuckle moments seen throughout the first half of the year”, he said in a note to investors. Investors will also be looking for more information about the company’s robotaxis following a disappointing launch event. After unveiling the company’s much-hyped robotaxi earlier this month with scant details, Tesla shares dropped by just under 9% and wiped more than $60bn from the company’s value. At the time, Tom Narayan, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note to investors that the event was more focused on branding and marketing Musk’s vision “rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out” as is expected at these events. Musk made some lofty predictions about the Cybercab ride-hail network. He said that Cybercab would reach volume production in 2026 and that Tesla was aiming to produce 2m a year. He also said Tesla expects to roll out ride-hailing to the public in California and Texas next year, “but it’s contingent on regulatory approval”, Musk said. “And maybe some other states next year but at least California and Texas.” Musk, who has been campaigning on behalf of Donald Trump, also called for a federal pathway to regulate autonomous vehicles. Musk said he also plans to integrate Grok, the generative AI chatbot being developed by his startup xAI, into Tesla vehicles. Grok is already integrated into Musk-owned X. He also hinted that Tesla may consider developing flying cars. Musk may also have to answer for his recent focus on politics. In addition to starting the America Pac, the X chief executive has been on the campaign trail on behalf of Donald Trump and has started a $1m daily sweepstakes for swing state voters who sign his petition. The giveaway has brought up legal questions, sparking calls for law enforcement to investigate Musk and the practice from people such as the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro. It is a federal crime to try to pay people to vote or register to vote. Musk’s activities seem to be having an impact on consumer sentiment around purchasing Teslas. Thirty-one per cent of shoppers surveyed by Edmunds, a car-buying website, said they are less likely to buy a Tesla because of Musk, while 37% of those surveyed said they were waiting for the election results to decide whether to buy a Tesla and 44% of Democratic women said they were not as likely to buy a Tesla because of Musk. Overall demand for electric vehicles continues to increase, however. US EV market share hit an all-time high at 8.3%, up from 7.5% in the same quarter of 2023, according to Edmunds. Musk is facing legal scrutiny elsewhere as well. The EU is considering fining X based on total sales by SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company. The bloc alleges the social media company failed to address illegal content and disinformation on its platform. Fines can be as much as 6% of the yearly revenue of a company. Tesla will likely be exempt from that fine, however, as it is a public company and not wholly owned by Musk."

                    "headline": "NHS in England to trial AI tool to predict risk of fatal heart disease",
                    "bodyText": "The NHS in England is to trial a “superhuman” artificial intelligence tool that predicts a patient’s risk of disease and dying early. The new technology, known as AI-ECG risk estimation, or Aire, is trained to read the results of electrocardiogram (ECG) tests, which record the electrical activity of the heart and are used to check for problems. It can detect problems in the structure of the heart that doctors would not be able to see, and flag patients who may benefit from further monitoring, tests or treatment. In a world first, it will initially be trialled at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust and Chelsea and Westminster hospital NHS foundation trust, before being tested in other hospitals. It is understood hundreds of patients will be recruited in the first instance, with numbers then scaled up for further studies. Research published in the Lancet Digital Health journal found Aire could correctly identify a patient’s risk of death in the 10 years after the ECG in 78% of cases. Researchers trained Aire using a dataset of 1.16m ECG test results from 189,539 patients. The platform could also predict future heart failure in 79% of cases, future serious heart rhythm problems in 76% of cases, and future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease – where the arteries narrow, making blood flow difficult – in 70% of cases. Dr Fu Siong Ng, a reader in cardiac electrophysiology at Imperial College London and a consultant cardiologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, said: “The vision is every ECG that will be done in hospital will be put through the model. So anyone who has an ECG anywhere in the NHS in 10 years’ time, or five years’ time, would be put through the models and the clinicians will be informed, not just about what the diagnosis is, but a prediction of a whole range of health risks, which means that we can then intervene early and prevent disease. “If, for example, it says you’re at high risk of a specific heart rhythm problem, you could be more aggressive in preventative treatment to prevent it from happening. There are some linked to weight, so you can put them through weight-loss programmes. You might even think about earlier medical treatments to prevent things from progressing, but that will be the subject of the clinical studies that we plan to do.” Dr Arunashis Sau, a British Heart Foundation (BHF) clinical research fellow at Imperial College London’s National Heart and Lung Institute and a cardiology registrar at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, said the goal was to use the AI checks on the ECGs to identify people at higher risk. “ECG is a very common and very cheap test, but that could then be used to guide more detailed testing that could then change how we manage patients and potentially reduce the risk of anything bad happening. “One key distinction is that the goal here was to do something that was superhuman – so not replace or speed up something that a doctor could do, but to do something that a doctor cannot do from looking at heart tracing.”"

                    "bodyText": "An artificial intelligence startup backed by Amazon and Google says it has created an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the computer such as moving a mouse cursor and typing text. US company Anthropic said its AI model, called Claude, could now perform computing tasks including filling out forms, planning an outing and building a website. Autonomous AI agents are viewed by tech firms and investors as a potentially lucrative avenue of development for a technology whose capabilities have stunned users but can cost billions of dollars to build and operate. Anthropic, a competitor to ChatGPT owner OpenAI, is making the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model available to developers but admitted it can be prone to errors. “At this stage, it is still experimental – at times cumbersome and error-prone,” the company said. “We’re releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time.” Anthropic has released a demo showing the model using a fictional employee’s computer to fill out a form, having been asked to carry out the task using data from a spreadsheet and open onscreen tabs. In other demos, seen by the Financial Times and Wired, the AI agent planned and created a calendar appointment for a trip to view the sunrise in San Francisco and built a simple website to promote itself. The Anthropic announcement came shortly after Microsoft launched a product that allows companies to build their own autonomous AI agents. Early adopters of the Copilot Studio product include the consulting company McKinsey, which is building an agent to process new client inquiries by carrying out tasks such as scheduling follow-up meetings. Other early users include the law firm Clifford Chance and the retailer Pets at Home. Anthropic and Microsoft both referred to their products reducing “drudge” work such as filling out forms or handling client queries. Microsoft said employees should see such tools as an “enabler” for workers rather than a threat to their jobs. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international research body, has said the occupations at highest risk from AI-driven automation are highly skilled jobs and account for approximately a quarter of employment across its 38 member countries, which include the UK, Japan, Germany, the US and Australia. Andrew Rogoyski, a director at the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the tech industry was now “teetering on the edge” of enabling large-scale use of autonomous agents. “At one level there may be an opportunity for users to learn how to do things more efficiently, and to automate repetitive tasks. At another we may be teaching future AIs how to do our jobs,” he said."

                    "bodyText": "Apple’s premium tiny tablet gets a speed boost for 2024 with support for new accessories and imminent AI features, while providing the full modern iPad experience in a compact package. The revamped design of the iPad mini in 2021 was excellent so it is no surprise that Apple has kept it mostly the same with internal changes and a tweak to the side to support new accessories. But while it may be small in stature, the new iPad mini remains pricey, costing from £499 (€599/$499/A$799), placing it in between the £329 base-model iPad and the £599 11in iPad Air. The new tablet looks like a smaller version of the iPad Air, keeping the same 8.3in LCD display as its predecessor, which is crisp, bright and with a low-glare coating to make it easier to use outdoors. The so-called “jelly scroll” screen effect seen when scrolling on its predecessor is improved but you can still see it if you look hard enough. The tablet’s great stereo speakers make the most of any videos or games. Its super thin body, sub-300g weight and width that is about the same as an A5 paper pad make the iPad mini really easy to grip, use and fit in bags. The almost pocketable size makes it an excellent companion at school or on the commute, ready to take notes, play videos or for reading books like a Kindle. Its predecessor found niches with various professions, including hospitality and healthcare, with pilots being particular fans who will no doubt love this one. The one thing that hasn’t changed that should have is the position of the centre stage video call camera, which is still on the lefthand side when held in landscape, rather than the top edge to match the rest of Apple’s iPad lineup. It still works fine, but gives you a lower angle for video calls, which isn’t ideal. Specifications Screen: 8.3in 2266x1488 LCD display (326ppi) Processor: Apple A17 Pro RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: iPadOS 18 Camera: 12MP rear and selfie cameras Connectivity: wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID Dimensions: 195.4 x 134.8 x 6.3mm Weight: 293g (4G version: 297g) New A17 Pro chip and iPadOS 18 The biggest change for the new iPad mini is the upgrade to the A17 Pro chip that was first used in the iPhone 15 Pro. It provides a 30% speed increase over the outgoing model, as well as an AI processor that is twice as fast. It is in a class of its own compared with similarly sized tablets from rivals, but it isn’t quite as powerful as Apple’s M2 or M4 chips used in its larger Air and Pro iPad models and doesn’t support some of the more computer-like features. You can plug a monitor into the tablet via USB-C but only for mirroring the screen or video output, not for use as an external display with the Stage Manager multitasking system. The battery lasts slightly longer than its predecessor at about 12 hours for streaming video over wifi or a solid 10 hours of general app usage for browsing, note taking and emailing. Playing games or other more intensive usage shaves a couple of hours off the total, but it is still thoroughly impressive for a tablet of this size. The iPad mini runs the latest iPadOS 18 with its various new customisation options and brilliant new maths notes feature when used with a stylus. But like the recently released iPhones, it lacks Apple’s much-advertised Intelligence features, such as a smarter Siri, notification summaries, various AI writing tools, emoji and image generators. They will start rolling out in beta with the iPadOS 18.1 update at the end of October in the US and December for the UK, Australia and other non-US English countries. None of the features will work in the EU. Sustainability The battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from £115. The tablet is generally repairable with a damaged out-of-warranty repair costing from £339. The tablet contains at least 25% recycled content, including aluminium, copper, glass, gold, tin, plastic and rare earth elements. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The iPad mini A17 Pro starts at £499 (€599/$499/A$799) or £649 (€769/$649/A$1,049) with 5G. For comparison, the 10th-gen iPad costs from £329, M2 iPad Air costs from £599, the iPad Pro M4 costs from £999, the Amazon Fire HD 8 costs £99.99, Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 costs £169, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs £1,799 and the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs £1,749. Verdict Important chip and capability updates have kept the iPad mini the best small tablet available by no small margin. It is unrivalled with its nearest competitors being a handful of cheap Android tablets or the new breed of super expensive folding phones. Its practically-pocketable size makes it easy to hold and fit in bags, while iPadOS provides plenty of apps for a wide range of uses, not just entertainment. Equipped with a £129 Apple Pencil Pro it is a particularly good, if expensive, paper notebook replacement. Not having the M-series chips used in the iPad Air and Pro models limits its multitasking capabilities while the bigger screen of the cheaper 10th-gen iPad makes it a better buy for most people just wanting an Apple entertainment device. It is not a dramatic upgrade over the 2021 model either. With phones getting bigger and bigger, the iPad mini may seem redundant, but it is a particular favourite of journalists, pilots and those who need a highly capable, compact tablet that lasts a long time between charges. For all those people, the new A17 Pro iPad mini is almost perfect. Pros: compact design, great performance, 10-hour battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS, large range of apps, great speakers, great mics, long software support, recycled aluminium, Apple Pencil Pro support. Cons: expensive, small size is cramped for some applications, video call camera on the side in landscape, no M-series chip for advanced multitasking or computer use, not a big upgrade."

                    "bodyText": "At the height of the first pandemic summer in 2020, I sent more than £18,000 to a scammer. Back then, I’d never heard of the kind of con that ensnared me, though I later learned it was a classic of the genre: a call from my bank’s “fraud team” warning of “suspicious activity” on my account, followed by instructions to move my vulnerable funds into a new “safe” account. Later that night, my housemate stared in horror as I explained the conversation I’d had with a nice man from the bank. “Moya,” he said, aghast. “That was a scam.” By the time I understood what had happened, it was too late. Each of my three bank accounts read £0.00. In the weeks that followed, I felt as though my mind was disintegrating. I had struggled sporadically with anxiety for years, but that had always come on subtly, sneakily, like smoke creeping under a door. This was psychological devastation of a different order, more akin to being clubbed around the head. I was 28, and every imagined future version of my life had been predicated on those savings. Now, I believed those futures had been suddenly and violently erased. If I wasn’t sobbing and vomiting on the street, I felt numb and dissociated, as if I was floating above myself. For the first time in my life, I wished I didn’t have to wake up in the morning. I didn’t want to be dead, but I didn’t want to have to exist, either. In the end, I was lucky: my bank reimbursed me in full. But since then, whenever I have seen headlines highlighting the staggering level of scams and fraud in the UK, I have thought about the people behind the numbers. According to a report from UK Finance, in 2023, £459.7m was lost in cases of “authorised” fraud, where the victim is tricked into sending money to a fraudster. Confirmed cases are up more than 50% since 2020. Against the backdrop of the UK’s mental health crisis, experts are increasingly sounding the alarm about the impact of scams on victims’ psyches. Recent research by Which? shows that three in five UK fraud victims say their mental health was negatively affected by the experience, while a separate, not-yet-published survey by Lloyds found 69% of fraud victims experienced a decline in their mental health. Anxiety, depression and low self-esteem are commonly reported by fraud victims whose mental health is affected. Prof Mark Button, the director of the Centre for Cybercrime and Economic Crime at the University of Portsmouth, says he is aware of “lots of cases” where someone has killed themself “as a result of fraud victimisation”. On one level, this isn’t surprising. We know financial strain is linked to mental ill health, and it is not unreasonable to assume that a person might struggle following a crime that hurts their bank balance. But experts say the connection between scams and psychological wellbeing is more complex. “You might say, if you’ve lost £20,000, that must be awfully traumatic,” says Wayne Stevens, the national fraud lead at Victim Support. “But actually, we see people losing those sums of money who managed to ride it out, and then people losing a 10th of that amount [where] it has a devastating effect on them.” Our response to a scam is not usually shaped by financial loss, Stevens says, but by factors including “how connected we are with our family, our friends or our community; whether we’ve got other things going on in our lives, [such as] bereavements and employment [issues or] insecure housing; or whether we’ve experienced personal trauma”. Even in cases where a scam fails, the psychological impact can be profound. Funmi (not her real name), who is 78 and from London, was recently the victim of an attempted computer takeover scam. “I kept getting an alert, purporting to be from a legit cybersecurity firm, telling me to enter my details to protect my computer,” says the retired teacher, who has been on medication and in therapy for anxiety since the 1980s. Funmi often worries about her online security, and she followed the alert’s instructions. Suddenly, the scammer had control of her computer. “I could see the cursor going everywhere. Then [the scammer] was in my PayPal, and I thought, oh my God.” The scammer tried to steal only £35 from Funmi and her bank immediately blocked the transaction. But the experience has still “ramped up” her anxiety, especially as she is now being bombarded with phishing texts and emails. (Fraudsters are known to sell lists of victims’ details to other criminals.) “I feel so vulnerable – my phone has become a device of horror and dread,” Funmi says. “I feel paranoid about everything.” Paranoia is a common response in the wake of a scam, and it can be difficult to shake. Stefan Walters, a psychotherapist and registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says he has noticed an increase in recent years of clients wanting to discuss being scammed. Falling victim to a scam or fraud, he explains, can force us to reassess our “internal working model”, or the unconscious beliefs we hold about ourselves and others. “We may think: ‘Is the world around me full of people I could trust and who have good intentions? Or is it full of people who are out to get me?’” After being scammed, we might also “start to look at ourselves and say: ‘Am I a good character? Do I know what to look for in people? Maybe I’m really gullible,’” Walters continues. “We start to doubt not only other people, but also ourselves.” For Des Healey, 59, from Peacehaven in East Sussex, being scammed hasn’t just meant financial loss – it has fundamentally challenged his sense of self. The scam started when he clicked on a Facebook advert for an “AI cryptocurrency platform” in August 2023. Encouraged by nightly phone conversations with an affable man posing as his financial adviser, and reassured by the platform’s apparent endorsements from Elon Musk and Martin Lewis, Healey began investing increasingly large sums, ultimately losing £76,000. Since the scam, Healey has struggled with symptoms of depression, anxiety and paranoia. When he started to cry during an appointment with his GP about a physical health issue, the doctor concluded he was probably experiencing bodily reactions to the mental toll of the scam. Healey comes across as confident and canny. He raised his son as a single parent, runs his own business fitting bathrooms and kitchens, and until the scam had an excellent credit rating. “I did think I was very streetwise,” he says. “I would be the person to warn someone: ‘That’s a scam, it doesn’t sound right.’ And yet here I am.” In the aftermath of a scam, the process of trying to get their money back can make victims feel even worse. Button says the multiple agencies involved in preventing and responding to scams – including financial institutions, telecoms companies and tech platforms – are not sufficiently “joined up”, meaning it is essentially “a lottery whether someone will get the true support that they need”. Research by National Trading Standards shows that among the minority of victims who report the crime to the authorities, almost half (47%) say they were made to feel “stupid or embarrassed”. Only 34% felt “fully heard and understood”. Since 2019, most UK high street banks have signed up to a voluntary code that outlines how they should refund victims of bank transfer scams (also known as “authorised push payment” or APP fraud). Banks can refuse to reimburse victims if they are judged to have been “grossly negligent” – meaning, in lay terms, they should have twigged they were being had. A recent rule change means all UK banks must now refund APP fraud victims within five days. But as the gross negligence caveat remains, many victims will still lose out. Margaret (not her real name), 73, who is retired and lives in Cheshire, fell victim to an impersonation scam similar to the one that affected me. She transferred £19,800 to the criminals, much of which had been left to her by her husband after his death last year. Margaret’s bank refused to reimburse her, saying she should have known it was a scam. The fraudsters had coached her to lie when real bank staff questioned the transfer. When you are the target of such a stigmatised crime, it can be excruciating to be blamed by your bank on top of everything else. Feeling “absolutely stupid” and worried about being judged, Margaret confided in just two people outside her immediate family about the scam. Two-thirds of scam victims don’t disclose the experience to anyone at all. The psychologist and trauma specialist Dr Heather Sequeira says the shame experienced by some people after a scam has parallels with “other forms of trauma, such as sexual trauma or domestic violence”, where victims are often blamed. Margaret says the scam left her feeling “violated and abused”, phrasing that is entirely appropriate: a study published in the British Journal of Criminology highlights striking similarities between the manipulative language used by fraudsters and perpetrators of coercive control. “In the same way that a victim of domestic abuse may think, ‘It’s my fault, I let him in my house’, a scam victim might say, ‘I didn’t read that properly’, or ‘I signed it,’” says Sequeira, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society. The shame “shuts us down”, she says. “It stops us from reaching out to get the help that would make us feel a bit better.” Even with the recent changes to reimbursement rules, experts say scam victims in the UK are getting a raw deal. Banks aren’t obliged to refund victims for amounts above £85,000 – even though the organisation behind the rule change, the Payment Systems Regulator, has acknowledged this could “[heighten] the psychological and emotional harm” caused to scam victims. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, says the reimbursement limit is “very disappointing. More needs to be done to lessen the unfair psychological burden on scam victims.” The government should lead a “more coordinated approach” on this issue, she adds. Until then? “Starting the conversation” may not be the solution to all mental health struggles, but in the context of scams, speaking to others can be like letting light and air into a dark, shuttered room. Some UK police forces now run peer support programmes for fraud victims, an approach many experts would like to see rolled out more widely. But there is power in talking about the emotional and mental impact of scams in our everyday lives, too. As a lifelong yapper, I was open about being scammed from the start, and found relief and solidarity in commiserating with other victims. These conversations took place mostly on social media, and helped me process my initial feelings of shock and humiliation into a cold and righteous anger. When I was fighting to get my money back, I needed that anger as fuel. Healey, the only scam victim I spoke to for this piece who wanted to be quoted under his real name, also refuses to be shamed into silence. “At first, I didn’t want to tell anybody,” he says. “I felt so embarrassed. But in the end, I thought to myself, why am I hiding what’s happened? I’m not the perpetrator. I’m the victim.” Through conversations with friends, colleagues and neighbours, Healey realised just how common scams are: they are happening to people of all ages and backgrounds, every day. That has helped him to stop blaming himself. “I still owe an extortionate amount of money,” he says. “But when I started to talk about it, I felt a release.” • If you have been the victim of a scam, you can access free advice and support through Victim Support.

                    "headline": "Thom Yorke and Julianne Moore join thousands of creatives in AI warning",
                    "bodyText": "Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, the actor Julianne Moore and the Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a “major, unjust threat” to artists’ livelihoods. The statement comes amid legal battles between creative professionals and tech firms over the use of their work to train AI models such as ChatGPT and claims that using their intellectual property without permission is a breach of copyright. “The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted,” reads the statement. Thousands of creative professionals from the worlds of literature, music, film, theatre and television have given their backing to the statement, with authors including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ann Patchett, and Kate Mosse, musicians including the Cure’s Robert Smith as well as the composer Max Richter and actors including Kevin Bacon, Rosario Dawson and F Murray Abraham. The organiser of the letter, the British composer and former AI executive Ed Newton-Rex, said people who make a living from creative work are “very worried” about the situation. “There are three key resources that generative AI companies need to build AI models: people, compute, and data. They spend vast sums on the first two – sometimes a million dollars per engineer, and up to a billion dollars per model. But they expect to take the third – training data – for free,” he said. Newton-Rex is a former head of audio at tech firm Stability AI but resigned last year over the firm’s belief that taking copyrighted content to train AI models without a licence constitutes “fair use”, a term under US copyright law meaning permission from the copyright owner is not needed. Newton-Rex added: “When AI companies call this ‘training data’, they dehumanise it. What we’re talking about is people’s work – their writing, their art, their music.” In the US John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and George RR Martin are among a group of authors suing ChatGPT developer OpenAI for alleged breach of copyright, while artists are also suing tech firms behind image generators and major record labels including Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group are suing AI music creators Suno and Udio. Newton-Rex also warned that an “opt-out” proposal for scraping content being considered by the UK government would be highly damaging. This month the Financial Times reported that ministers would consult on a scheme that would allow AI firms to scrape content from artists and publishers unless they “opt out” of the process. Last month Google, a major player in AI, called for the relaxation of restrictions on a practice in the UK known as text and data mining (TDM), where copying of copyrighted work is allowed for non-commercial purposes such as academic research. Newton-Rex said the opt-out option was flawed because most people are unaware of such schemes. “I have run opt-out schemes for AI companies,” said Newton-Rex. “Even the most well-run opt-out schemes get missed by most people who have the chance to opt out. You never hear about it, you miss the email. “It’s totally unfair to put the burden of opting out of AI training on the creator whose work is being trained on. If a government really thought this was a good thing for creators then it would create an opt-in scheme.” Newton-Rex said the number of signatories to the statement, and the breadth of creative talent they represent, made clear that an opt-out scheme would be considered “totally unfair” by creators. The statement is also signed by creative industry organisations and companies including the American Federation of Musicians, the US actors’ union SAG-AFTRA, the European Writers’ Council and Universal Music Group. A spokesperson for the UK government said meetings had been held with AI firms and the creative industries over copyright, adding that it was an area which “requires thoughtful engagement, and as part of that we are determined to hear a broad range of views to help inform our approach”."

                    "headline": "iPhone 16 Plus review: Apple’s battery beast",
                    "bodyText": "Apple’s iPhone 16 Plus takes the regular iPhone and adds two things: a much bigger screen and even longer battery life. The new plus-sized model has the exact same specs, camera and multiple additional buttons as the vanilla 16, offering the big screen Apple phone experience without blowing the budget on the most expensive 16 Pro Max with its massive 6.9in display. Instead, costing from £899 (€1,099/$899/A$1,599), it sits right between the £799 iPhone 16 and £999 iPhone 16 Pro models. The 16 Plus has a bright and crisp 6.7in display just like its predecessor, and sticks to the slower 60Hz refresh rate, making it less smooth when scrolling Apple’s Pro iPhones and rivals. It still looks good for film and TV shows on the commute, though. It is an aluminium and glass sandwich with realigned cameras on the back reminiscent of the iPhone 12. While the Plus is quite light for a big phone at 199g, it will still require two-handed use most of the time. A case or phone grip might be advisable. The two new buttons match the other 16 series iPhones this year. The action button replaces the mute switch from previous models and can be used to open apps, perform actions, turn on the torch or activate focus or mute modes. The camera control button quickly opens the camera and can then adjust settings such as zoom or depth and shoot photos all with one finger. It runs iOS 18 out of the box, which currently lacks Apple’s much-advertised AI features. They won’t be available in beta until the iOS 18.1 update in late October in the US and December for the UK, Australia and other non-US English-speaking countries, while the rest of Europe has a longer wait. Specifications Screen: 6.7in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A18 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: iOS 18 Camera: 48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm Weight: 199g Faster A18 chip with epic battery life The 16 Plus has the same new A18 chip as its smaller sibling and performs similarly, feeling significantly snappier in operation than its predecessors, with headroom to stay fast for a long time and the prerequisite 8GB of RAM and AI processor to support the imminent Apple Intelligence features. Increased power efficiency also helps the 16 Plus have tremendous battery life, lasting almost 72 hours of general use between charges, including a mix of 5G and wifi while actively using the screen for nine hours. That means charging it every third day, which is a day or so longer than the regular iPhone 16. Even with heavy use entirely on 5G and with lots of mapping the 16 Plus lasted up to two days. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The 16 Plus has repair guides available and was awarded seven out of 10 for repairability by specialists iFixit. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Better camera The dual camera system on the back is the same as the regular iPhone 16. It has faster versions of its 48MP main and 12MP ultrawide cameras compared with previous models, which make a difference with motion and in low-light environments. The main camera shoots great images, while the new macrophotography mode is great fun on the ultrawide camera. The photographic styles feature adjusts the colour, tone and palette of photos to tweak how they look either when shooting them or after the fact. If you don’t like Apple’s default look to photos you can get very creative with your own settings. The camera can also shoot spatial photos and videos for viewing on headsets such as the Vision Pro, and has the impressive audio mix feature for video from the 16 Pro. Overall, the 16 Plus has a good camera, but its lack of an extended zoom camera is disappointing, particularly at this size and price. Price The iPhone 16 Plus costs from £899 (€1,099/$899/A$1,599) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 costs £799, iPhone 16 Pro costs £999, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL costs £1,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus costs £999 and the Fairphone 5 costs £499. Verdict The iPhone 16 Plus occupies an odd spot in Apple’s 2024 smartphone lineup. It is identical in capability and hardware to the cheaper, smaller iPhone 16, which means it lacks the zoom camera, more advanced screen and other capabilities of the company’s Pro iPhones. Though the 6.7in display is sizeable, it is no longer the biggest screen on an iPhone, as the 16 Pro Max has an even larger and better display, for which you pay a hefty premium. Instead, the Plus has tremendous battery life that should see general usage of up to three days between charges and outlast even the heaviest of use days. So the 16 Plus is for those that want a bigger but not the best screen or need really long battery life. The trade-off is that it is £100 more than the already great regular iPhone 16, it is difficult to use one-handed and is a bit of a bulky lump in your pocket. Pros: fast, good dual camera with macro mode, big screen, action button, camera control button, photographic styles, USB-C, very long battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, screen slower than competition and Pro iPhones, no always-on display mode, needs two hands to use most of the time."

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has defended the housing plan to rezone affluent areas. And stamp duty for off-the-plan homes is being slashed in a stimulus bid. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government will accelerate the pace of an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Qantas was ordered to pay $170,000 to three workers illegally sacked at start of pandemic. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, registered the purchase of a plane. Hephner the alpaca met King Charles at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. A man was arrested outside the Australian War Memorial, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem at a parliamentary reception in Canberra. Thorpe was then removed from the reception after yelling “you stole from us” at king. Thorpe said she had intended to hand the king “a notice of complicity in genocide”. The Australian Monarchist League demanded Thorpe’s resignation after her “failed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King” at Parliament House this afternoon. The live news blog will be back tomorrow morning. Charles marvels at rainforest gully in botanic gardens In their last formal event in Canberra during this visit at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, King Charles walked down a path of rocky stairs into the rainforest gully with the head of the gardens, Dr Rebecca Pirzl. He held tightly to the rail and at the bottom of the steep stairs, paused touching a large tree and looked up into its canopy. As Queen Camilla made her way down the steps cautiously in her heels, the king told Pirzl “it’s extraordinary” while looking down the gully, which features plants from the diverse rainforests from Tasmania to Queensland. The king and queen walked along the lower boardwalk in the gully, Charles initially striding off quickly before Camilla called to him to slow down. They paused for photos before making their way up more rocky steps to the tree planting location. The Liberal candidate for Pittwater, Georgia Ryburn, has conceded the NSW state electorate to the independent candidate, Jacqui Scruby. Ryburn was not expected to win Saturday’s byelection by the time counting finished on the night, and this afternoon said she had called Scruby to congratulate her. In a post on her Instagram account, Ryburn said: I have just called Jacqui Scruby to concede and congratulate her. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t extremely disappointed. This wasn’t the outcome I had hoped for, but I know this isn’t the end of the road. I am extremely grateful to be your Liberal candidate for Pittwater, and am humbled by the amazing support from the Pittwater community and the Liberal party. Ryburn’s career as deputy mayor of the Northern Beaches council was cut short by her party’s failure to lodge the paperwork to nominate more than a third of its candidates for the recent local government elections. The Climate 200-backed Scruby secured a historic 22% swing against the Liberal party when she ran for Pittwater at the 2023 state election. She lost by only 606 votes to the Liberals’ Rory Amon, who triggered the byelection when he resigned less than halfway through his first term as Pittwater MP. Amon quit NSW parliament after being charged in August with 10 child sexual assault offences. He has denied all charges. King and queen plant snow gums King Charles and Queen Camilla each took part in the royal tradition of planting a tree in Canberra today. The governor general escorted the king and queen for the ceremony which took place in the grounds of Government House where they met the horticultural coordinator Glenn Huender and senior horticulturist Chris Mansfield, and planted Eucalyptus pauciflora – also know as snow gum trees. Schoolchildren from Wamberal public school had travelled for four hours to see the tree planting and student Imogen Kimble was on hand to help the king plant his tree. The king asked Huender about the composting for the soil, which was all done on site. The royals then went over to talk to the schoolchildren who were very excited to have the chance to meet them. The domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty, award-winning author of See What You Made Me Do, Jess Hill, professor of domestic and family violence at the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Anne Summers, and executive general manager, inclusion and social policy, at the Australian Football League, Tanya Hosch, were among a powerful group of advocates, experts and survivors who joined Queen Camilla today for a roundtable discussion about the epidemic of domestic violence gripping Australia. During the discussion the Queen heard from key sector experts as well as women with lived experience about the measures being implemented to try to end violence against women in Australia. Hosch said sport had an important role to play: One in 20 is a paid member of the AFL sporting code. There is a lot of work to be done. Camilla asked: Are these women prepared to come forward and talk? Do Indigenous people feel able to come forward? The governor gerneral, Sam Mostyn, said: Aboriginal women had fallen out of the system. There are hundreds of women over decades whose experiences are not recorded. Katie Kiss, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, talked to the queen about children being removed from their families. While Hill discussed the pervasiveness of coercive control: Perpetrators all study from the same handbook. It is terribly difficult to prove. Twenty-one-year-old Conor Pall from Mildura, Victoria was the sole male around the table. As a children’s author and advocate, Pall represents the rights of young people affected by family violence. He knows from personal experience how the voices of child victims are rarely heard in the justice system and is determined to use his lived experience as a male survivor to drive change. Before the roundtable Battie said it was “great” that the queen was using the tour to raise awareness of the issue. King surveys flora, meets Andrew Forrest and talks sport at botanic gardens King Charles was led on a detailed tour of the Banksia Gardens at Canberra’s National Botanic Gardens by Beverly Ardler and Kain Ardler from the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community, as well as Botanic Gardens head Dr Rebecca Pirzl. Wearing dark glasses in the hot Australian sun, the king moved slowly through the display of the iconic Australian plants, asking questions and pointing out particularly interesting examples. The Ardlers explained about the significance of banksia species to their community and how bushfires affected local ecosystems. The botanic gardens’ display is the largest collection of Australian plants in the world. The king was met at the entrance to the Banksia Gardens by Australian mining mandate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, with whom he spoke at length. On his way out, he was met by students from Ainslie School. Leo Turner, 12, asked the king if he’d heard of AFL. The king replied: Yes, I’ve heard of it. Leo asked: What’s your favourite sport? The king replied (before saying goodbye): I can’t do much now. Too many injuries. I used to sit on a horse. More in-home support needed for people ‘traumatised through institutions’ Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing on the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care says more support for in-home care is needed for all Australians who’ve been traumatised through institutions. Andrea Kelly from the department was speaking about the wish of many First Nations elders to stay on country. Kelly said she had conducted more than 135 consultations and met with around 1,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as peak bodies and providers around issues of cultural safety. Kelly said: People want to stay at home, they don’t want to go into residential aged care, and that’s particularly true for Stolen Generation survivors, veterans and members of the LGBQTI community that I’ve met with. Kelly agreed that greater in-home supports would need to be provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and other Australians who had experienced sexual child abuse. While my conversations have been specific with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I think that model of care we need to think about for all Australians who’ve been traumatised through institutions. King watches ‘bushfire’ during CSIRO lab visit King Charles has toured the CSIRO’s National Bushfire Behaviour Research Laboratory, where he viewed a “Pyrotron” demonstration. The seven-minute demonstration replicated a bushfire in a 29-metre-long combustion wind tunnel. The experiment is used to better understand bushfire behaviour and effective methods to suppress it, senior research scientist Matt Plucinski said. The king was invited to start the experiment as he met with researchers and CSIRO head Doug Hilton, receiving a briefing about how quickly the fires could spread. The eucalyptus smoke was “the smell of science”, Hilton joked with the king. Outside, an ACT Rural Fire Service engine doused itself during a “burn over drill”, demonstrating how firefighters stuck in the truck in the middle of a fire storm would survive the worst of the blistering inferno. The king was introduced to five volunteer firefighters before they started the drill, forcing him to take a slight step back as he was sprayed with a light mist due to the breeze. He told reporters as he left the site after the drill: It was very encouraging to see what they can do. He asked the firefighters about the differences between bushfires in the northern and southern hemispheres, including comparisons with Canada. It was King Charles’ second visit to a CSIRO Canberra site, the first being February 1966, when the young prince toured the wildlife research division. Multiple arrests during king’s ACT visit ACT police made multiple arrests in Canberra in relation to the visit of King Charles today. About 11am a 62-year-old man was arrested at the Australian War Memorial for breach of the peace. He was taken to the ACT watch house, where he signed an undertaking to keep the peace and was released without charge, police said. A second arrest was made about 11.30am, when police arrested a 21-year-old woman for failing to comply with a police direction, police said. She was charged and she faced ACT magistrates court this afternoon. Police said “several” other arrests were made at the Australian War Memorial – those people were later released without charge. In relation to an “interaction” with Senator Lidia Thorpe at the memorial, police said: This morning, police spoke to a protest group near the Australian War Memorial. The group was directed to move on from the area and they complied with that direction. No arrests were made and police consider the matter finalised. One-hour cap on household services for older people is due to budget, official says Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing, where the Department of Health and Aged Care has affirmed the goal of the new aged care bill will be to have people ageing at home for longer. Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne has raised why there is a one-hour cap on services to help older people clean their houses, including gardening, which was raised as a serious issue – alongside the lack of gardening services – preventing people staying at home longer. Allman-Payne gave the example of older renters being subject to eviction because of their inability to maintain the garden to a standard the landlord deems acceptable. Nick Morgan, from the department, said there was a one-hour cap on household services because of the need to retain budget for personal care and clinical services. Queensland LNP candidate says sorry for Nazi joke Queensland LNP candidate Bree James has apologised for making a Nazi joke in a Facebook post. On Saturday, the Barron River candidate posted an image of herself beside an election banner which had been vandalised with a spray painted moustache in the style of Adolf Hitler. “Even the banner is getting in the spirit and celebrating my German heritage”, she said, in the post advertising the city’s German festival. She apologised on the weekend, and again on Monday when Labor’s campaign bus visited her pre-poll booth. James reportedly told the cameras the post was a joke in poor taste that she had apologised for “and I hope people can forgive me”. On Monday, Labor opponent Craig Crawford said James is “unfit for office”. Bree James is unfit for office, and people should not be voting for her in the upcoming election. David Crisafulli should have cut her then and then. I’m pretty sure that if I had done something stupid like that, I certainly would have offered my position up to the premier. LNP leader David Crisafulli said on Monday that he’d spoken to his candidate and “I’ve expressed my view to her very clearly. “Is this acceptable? It’s not. It’s disappointing, it’s wrong, it’s not funny”, he said. The Australian Monarchist League is demanding the resignation of Senator Lidia Thorpe after her “failed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King” at Parliament House this afternoon. In a statement, the league’s national chairman, Philip Benwell, said: Senator Thorpe should step down with immediate effect. The Australian Monarchist League unequivocally condemns the ill-considered behaviour of this isolated senator. Her childish demonstration has done nothing to diminish the gratitude and pride that millions of Australians have for our country, its history, its peoples and its sound system of governance. In fact, it has likely only strengthened these feelings. Should she not resign, the league is calling for Thorpe’s “misconduct” to be addressed “in accordance with what is the obvious and prevailing public sentiment.” Albanese’s $4.3m home buy not a good look, ex-Tory MP says Rory Stewart, former Tory MP and co-host of the The Rest is News podcast, says Anthony Albanese’s purchase of a multimillion-dollar home on the New South Wales Central Coast “doesn’t look great”. “The idea of buying luxury mansions doesn’t look great when you’re a leftwing leader,” he told David Speers, host of ABC Insiders, in an interviewed aired on Afternoon Briefing. Keir Starmer’s popularity ratings are tanking because he’s getting wealthy donors to buy him fancy spectacles and clothes for his wife. And Boris Johnson was not helped by having or putting £100,000 wallpaper on his walls. David Cameron understood this and deliberately cut his salary when he came in as prime minister ... travelled on EasyJet. When asked if it is fair to say voters don’t like to see their prime ministers getting anything, other than being paid, he said: That’s true, and as a working politician, I often was resentful of that. I remember that there were times when I felt like saying to voters: ‘Listen, it would be better if we returned if you like to the British parliament of the early 20th century where MPs didn’t receive salaries and we’ll just work for free for you!’ But, of course, there are problems with doing that too. When asked whether the coarseness of Trumpian politics were permeating the political culture in the Anglosphere, he said he had noticed the “dead cat strategy” in effect: Which is – if somebody is focusing on some scandal, something that you’ve got wrong, you just slap a dead cat on the table and move on. Senator Lidia Thorpe has released a statement following her remarks to the king in Parliament House this afternoon. She said she intended to hand “a notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county” to King Charles. The senator’s uncle, Robert Thorpe, issued the same notice to the international criminal court on 13 October, according to the statement. She said: Today I intended to hand King Charles a notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county. Krauatungalung elder, Uncle Robbie Thorpe, issued this notice to the international criminal court on October 13 this year, requesting King Charles be charged and prosecuted for genocide. The visit by the so-called king should be an occasion of truth-telling about the true history of this country. The colonial state has been built on the continuing genocide on First Peoples. Today I was silenced and removed from the parliamentary reception when pointing out that the Crown stole from First Peoples. The truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives. The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the First Peoples of this country. These crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and failure to prevent genocide. There has been no justice for these crimes. The Crown must be held accountable. Today, the AFP threatened to arrest me for wearing a T-shirt that said ‘Stolen Land, Stolen Lives, Stolen Wealth’. I was at a rally to call out the crimes committed by the Crown. This is a clear attack on free speech and expression, at the war memorial of all places. Sovereign elder Uncle Coco was arrested by AFP today for peacefully standing up against the genocide on his people and all First Peoples of this continent. This colonial government will punish our elders for protesting against a genocide but refuse to hold the perpetrators to account. Today we call for justice, an end to this ongoing genocide, for treaty and a republic. We want to be able to live in peace and finally come together as a nation. ‘Spectrum of supported decision-making’ in new aged care bill, department says Older Australians will be supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible under the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care said this afternoon when answering questions from the Senate standing committee on community affairs on the bill. Mel Metz, the assistant secretary of the legislative reform branch in the department, said – after peak bodies representing older people advocated strongly for including supported decision-making arrangements in the bill – that the model on which the framework was based came from an Australian Law Reform Commission report as well as more recent endorsement through the disability royal commission. Supported decision-making recognises capacity to make decision is not black and white, and it exists on a spectrum and can fluctuate, and that’s especially true in aged care for people with dementia. What supported decision-making means is that rather than substituting a new decision-maker when a person’s decision-making capacity diminishes, people are supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible. There’s a single concept of supporter rather than a dual representative and supporter framework in the bill – recognising that capacity isn’t static and that a person might need different levels of assistance day to day. Drawing on state and territory arrangements in place, “there is a substitute decision-making in the bill – but that’s at the very end of that spectrum of supported decision-making for people who absolutely cannot make decisions even with support”. Thorpe’s behaviour ‘alienated a lot of people’ – Labor MP Over to Afternoon Briefing, where – you guessed it – the king and queen are on the agenda. Speaking with the ABC, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Patrick Gorman, who is responsible for much of the planning behind the king’s whistle-stop tour, commented on Lidia Thorpe’s remarks shouted to the king at the state reception in Parliament House’s Great Hall. I thought that behaviour was pretty inappropriate. I think that it alienated a lot of people. And I think most of the Australian public expect that their members and senators behave with dignity, especially at these formal state occasions. I can’t speak for the Senate, they are in charge of their own members and their own disciplinary procedures. What I hope is that this doesn’t detract from the fact that it was an incredibly warm reception for the king and the queen. There was clearly a lot of people in the room who were really honoured to have been invited to that very special occasion. As you said, the first time that we’ve had a king of Australia in fact visit Australia, and what we saw in the king’s remarks were his warm affection for this country – a country that he came here as a student. He’s visited 17 times. And I think that he really went out of his way, not just to talk about the causes that were important to him, such as climate change, but also to talk about his great appreciation of the respect that First Nations Australians have shown him on those visits. King’s visit ‘difficult for many First Nations people’, Greens senator says Greens senator Dorinda Cox says the visit of King Charles III is a reminder of colonialism’s “harrowing injustices”. The Yamatji-Noongar woman said on Monday – before Senator Lidia Thorpe’s comments disrupted a state reception in Canberra – that the federal Truth and Justice Commission Bill, introduced by the Greens, would allow for First Nations-led, trauma-informed truth telling to fully implement all pillars of the Uluru statement from the heart. In a statement, Cox said: This visit will be difficult for many First Nations people, who still feel the injustice every day of colonialism, especially our stolen generations, which are perpetuated through systemic and structural racism and discrimination. Visiting memorials and attending charity events is not changing the harrowing injustices and ongoing unacceptable rates of deaths of our people in Australia. First Nations justice, truth telling and healing needs to be a priority. The king should be clear in his recognition and support of this. He now needs to be on the right side of history. We need the Labor government to have clear instructions from their sovereign head that we can’t continue on this path if we want peace and healing, this comes with accepting responsibility for the role, actions and destructive impacts of the Crown. Cox went on to say: I invite the king to reflect on this and that sovereignty that was never ceded. There is trauma and grief for First Nations people. He needs to hear this and acknowledge it. The commonwealth has nothing to fear from this formal recognition. First Nations communities continue to feel the impact of policies rooted in colonial attitudes – such as forced removals, land and resources theft, and systemic discrimination – that has left deep scars that we need to heal from. We cannot do this without truth telling and truth listening. The time is now. It’s time to respect our inherent, sovereign right to self-determination, including the protection and preservation of our lands and waters – under our custodianship. Ensuring Australia’s First Peoples are consulted in every vital decision about our shared future. Watt welcomes compensation ruling on illegal Qantas sackings The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has welcomed the federal court decision for Qantas to compensate workers found to be illegally sacked during the pandemic. In a post to X, Watt wrote: I congratulate [the Transport Workers Union] for pursuing this case in the Federal Court. I also congratulate Qantas’ new management team for taking a more cooperative approach to workplace relations, which is delivering for the company and its workers alike. Tony Abbott says ‘unfortunate political exhibitionism’ from Lidia Thorpe Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who attended the event, expressed his dismay at Lidia Thorpe’s remarks to the King in the Great Hall. “It’s unfortunate political exhibitionism, that’s all I’d say,” he said after the event. Another guest, businessman Dick Smith, said the disruption was an aspect of Australian democracy. I think that’s the wonderful part of our democracy – that she’s not going to be put in jail. Smith has known the king for many years, including a meeting in 1982 when Smith landed his helicopter on the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the UK. Sewage theory investigated after Sydney beach tar balls The sewage theory floated as an explanation for the “tar balls” that closed eastern Sydney beaches last week has not been ruled out by the lead agency investigating the source of the pollution. In a statement this afternoon, a spokesperson for NSW Maritime said: Investigations are continuing, with a number of samples still being tested by the NSW Environment Protection Authority. An update will be provided once the origin is definitively known. On Friday, Jon Beves, a chemistry expert from University of New South Wales who is part of a team of scientists analysing the debris, told Guardian Australia the “most logical answer” was that the balls were formed from crude oil. However, he said the balls also contained other greasy materials including fatty acids which meant they potentially had come from a sewage outflow instead of an oil spill or leak off the coast. Later that same day, the NSW Maritime executive director, Mark Hutchings, said: Based on advice from the EPA, we can now confirm the balls are made up of fatty acids, chemicals consistent with those found in cleaning and cosmetic products, mixed with some fuel oil. They are not harmful when on the ground, but should not be touched or picked up. Thank you, Emily Wind. Let’s get on with the rest of the day’s breaking news. Over in Canberra, our team has pieced together the full transcript of senator Lidia Thorpe’s remarks to King Charles at a state reception in the Great Hall at Parliament House a short time ago: You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist. This is not your land. This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Daisy Dumas will be with you for the next little while. Take care. Here’s another angle of Lidia Thorpe’s protest in parliament house earlier this afternoon, where she shouted following King Charles’ speech: ‘Offensive graffiti’ in Sydney’s eastern suburbs investigated NSW police have released CCTV footage after multiple structures were graffitied across Sydney overnight. Police said officers located “offensive graffiti” on the walls of multiple structures in Bronte, Tamarama and Bondi beaches late last night. Photographs sent to 2GB’s Ben Fordham show the word “Hamas” graffitied. Police said an investigation has commenced, and investigators had released images of a man they believed might be able to assist with inquiries. He is depicted wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt, black jeans, white/grey shoes, a grey beanie and blue face mask. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Greens say they will ‘keep fighting’ for republic Earlier today, deputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi issued a statement ahead of the parliamentary reception for King Charles and said the party would “keep fighting” for a republic. In the statement, Faruqi said: The truth is, racism and colonialism are intertwined; and the monarchy symbolises an era that should be left behind for good, not celebrated. Preserving the British monarchy is to preserve white supremacy and the systemic racist structures that were built by the empire and persist today. It’s time for Australia to embrace a republic rooted in decolonisation and sovereignty for First Nations – a crucial step towards racial justice, truth telling and treaty. RBA says it is not ‘data obsessed’ Andrew Hauser, the Reserve Bank’s deputy governor, has conceded that the strength of Australia’s labour market in September had been “surprising”, or so he told a CBA global markets conference in Sydney today. As you may recall, the jobless rate actually edged lower to 4.1% (from what had previously been reported by the Bureau of Statistics as 4.2% for August), with an addition of about 62,000 jobs. Markets had already been tilting towards an interest cut NOT landing until February and now they are pricing in that first reduction as most likely next April. (April Fool’s Day, as it happens.) Hauser, though, made it clear that the RBA was also not “data obsessed”, with the jobs figures just part of the wider “context” the board will consider. As we’ve noted in this blog previously, the September quarter inflation figures will land on 30 October, and most of the other data points (including the monthly CPI figures) are basically noise. We also asked Hauser about China, particularly in light of the latest effort to stoke growth, namely today’s cuts in official interest rates. He said: What happens in China matters for us, both in terms of our export growth and in terms of our investments, and so, you know, we are watching it closely. He didn’t say whether he thought the Chinese rate cuts would work, along with the barrage of other stimulatory efforts. “I think it’s possible to tell different stories about the outlook for China”, ranging from the pessimistic to the more optimistic. In a nod to his next speech – about the importance to Australia’s fortunes that international markets remain open – Hausers said: Trends in the Australian economy [were] very often shaped by events outside of Australia. The RBA board next meets on 4-5 November, wrapping up just as the US population goes to the polls – another overseas event that could play a big bearing not just on Australia but just about everywhere else. Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe issued a statement calling for a “treaty republic”. She said that Australia had “unfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic” – and that this “must happen through treaty”. You can read more of what she said earlier in the blog, here. Here is the moment that independent senator Lidia Thorpe shouted after King Charles’ speech in Parliament House just earlier. As Sarah Basford Canales notes, Thorpe can be heard saying: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. More from Australia’s privacy commissioner on AI Continuing from our last post: Some companies have updated their terms since the arrival of large-language-model AI systems to say that personal data will be used unless users opt out, and in some cases this has only been picked up by users of the platform delving into the terms and sharing that information with other users. Carly Kind said only updating the policy wasn’t sufficient: Just updating a privacy policy will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act, in which entities have to be able to establish that it’s within users’ reasonable expectations that their personal information will be used in a different way. And so I think that’s the relevant test that entities need to turn their mind to. If you don’t have consent to use that information in a different way, then you need to be able to show it within users’ reasonable expectations. Privacy watchdog issues AI warning over people’s data Australia’s privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, has warned companies that bury how they’ll use AI on people’s data they have collected risk being investigated by her office. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner released new guidelines for both developers of AI systems and the organisations that use those systems on how personal information should be used. Kind told Guardian Australia: We think that this guidance will hopefully set out pretty clearly how they need to be thinking about that when it comes to larger players and the developments of developers of these models. We’re articulating the legal situation we would have imagined that they had also given consideration to, these laws in the development of these models. We would expect to see compliance with the Privacy Act in instances where the Privacy Act applies, and it does apply to some overseas entities. And then it will be a matter for my office to consider whether to take enforcement action if we do have a sufficient suspicion to suspect non-compliance. King ‘doing an amazing job’, longtime fan says Earlier, Elaine Hoskins spoke of the moment she got to shake Queen Camilla’s hand at the Australian War Memorial. Camilla is wonderful. Always the lady, and she is such a supporter to him, and it was a privilege to talk to her today. Hoskins drove up from Melbourne with her husband, Russell Baker, to get a glimpse of the royals. But it wasn’t her first time travelling afar to see the British monarchy. Donning a tiara, Hoskins said she was a fan of King Charles III since she was 12. Charles and I are the same age, yes, and so he was my pin-up boy on my wall from when I was about 12. He came to the throne through sadness, but as he is now, I think he’s doing an amazing job. Hoskins went to King Charles’ coronation in England, where she picked up the flag she brought to Canberra. As for Baker, does he share his wife’s love for the British monarchy too? Oh yeah, but she is an absolute monarchist. She’s just mad [about the royals] ... I don’t care. I’m a royalist more than anything – I don’t think we should be a republic. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has been removed from a parliamentary reception for King Charles and Queen Camilla after yelling “this is not your country” and “you are not my king” and “fuck the colony”. After King Charles concluded his speech, Thorpe walked up the aisle towards the stage, yelling at the royal couple. “You stole from us,” she shouted, as officials stepped forward to stop her reaching the stage. … You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. As security officers escorted Thorpe back to the door, she shouted: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. As she left the hall and was forced back into the foyer she could be heard shouting: “Fuck the colony.” Wrap-up of Albanese and Dutton’s speeches Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton welcomed King Charles and Queen Camilla to Parliament House with warm greetings and a few jokes, thanking them for standing with Australians in good times and bad. Albanese called it honour of his life to have led the Australian delegation attending the king’s coronation. Albanese praised the king’s engagement on issues including climate change and reconciliation. You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times where we’ve debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the Crown. Nothing stands still. Dutton also welcomed the royal couple and lightened the mood, noting how much those gathered had been anticipating the visit. “People have had haircuts, people have shined shoes – and that’s just the republicans,” Dutton said, drawing laughter around the room. King’s speech ends with heckles The king has finished his speech with applause heard across the room, but a heckler can be heard from the crowd: You are not out king … Give us our land back … You destroyed our land … We want treaty. Today’s global challenges require ‘both ancient and new thinking’ – king King Charles said that with Covid-19 “barely behind us”, the impacts of climate change “deepening” and the “horrors of war, death and needless destruction all too visible”, this moment in history “requires both ancient and new thinking”. The challenges we now face call us to show not only constancy and valour but also humanity, empathy and generosity of spirit. Looking out across the global commonwealth of nations, I see a family of some 2.5 billion people striving for peace, justice and mutual respect. The commonwealth spans six continents and as a group has the size and influence to play a significant role on the global stage, while being small enough to nurture a personal relationship. It has the diversity to understand the world’s problems, and the sheer brain power and resolve to formulate practical solutions. King says Australia ‘particularly vulnerable’ to climate change King Charles noted the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, the floods of 2022-23 and the tropical cyclones last year and this year, and spoke of the importance of addressing climate change. I cannot tell you how much I have felt grief and shock of what you have gone, through having visited many of the communities myself over all of these years. Amid such overwhelming challenges, I have always been deeply impressed by the extraordinary bravery and resilience of those who look up, look out and – in that most Australian way – battle on … The regular roll of unprecedented events is an unmistaken sign of climate change, to which Australia is so particularly vulnerable. The king said that Australia’s “international leadership on global initiatives to protect our climate and biodiversity is of such absolute and critical importance”. Australia has all of the natural ingredients to create a more sustainable, regenerative way of living, by harnessing the power with which nature has endowed the nation. Whether it be wind or its famous sunshine, Australia is tracking the path towards a better and safer future. King recalls attending Victorian school in 60s King Charles is speaking about his first visit to Australia in 1966 for school in Victoria – “and, ladies and gentlemen, what an education it was!” I had thought that the school I had been attending in Scotland was remote and testing enough, but nothing had quite prepared me for the realities of the bush country around Mount Bulla. Six decades since his first visit, the king said he was “witnessed both continuity and great change.” It is worth reflecting that Australia’s unique character has endured and also evolved, and that Australia has become a stronger nation as a result of becoming one of the most multicultural on Earth. King notes Australia’s ‘long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation’ King Charles III is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception, saying he is “enormously touched” by the welcome. Let me also say how deeply I appreciated this morning’s moving Welcome to Country ceremony, which offers me the opportunity to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands on which we meet – the Ngunnawal people and all First Nations peoples who have loved and cared for this continent for 65,000 years. In my many visits to Australia, I have witnessed the courage and hope that have guided the nation’s long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation. Throughout my life, Australia’s First Nations peoples have done me the great honour of sharing so generously their stories and cultures. I can only say how much my own experience has been shaped and strengthened by such tradition and wisdom. Dutton says Australia should ‘never take British inheritance for granted’ Peter Dutton told King Charles that his presence “reminds Australians of all of the things that we love about Britain” – as well as “our great British heritage”. Representative democracy, the constitution, the separation of powers, the rule of law, the English language, freedom of speech, of association of the press, and so much more besides. We should never take our British inheritance for granted. Australia has benefited from the stability of a democracy with the monarchy as our bedrock. Through times of peace and war, constitutional and parliamentary crises, good times and bad – Australians have known stability and have taken confidence knowing that there are better days ahead, because our institutions are protected and underpinned by the independence and stoicism of the reigning monarch. Peter Dutton is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception. The opposition leader took a moment to send his well wishes to Princess Catherine: Upon your return home, your majesties, I know that you will convey Australia’s well wishes to the Princess of Wales. ‘The commonwealth is family’ – PM Anthony Albanese has noted “decades of change” in Australia, stating that “bonds of respect and affection” have endured. He told King Charles during the address: The Australia you first knew has grown and evolved in so many ways. Our communities have been strengthened and enriched from people drawn from every culture [and] background … As a modern, outward-looking economy, we found our place in the world and made our home in the region. We’ve gained a deeper and truer understanding of our national story. Yet through these decades of change, our bonds of respect and affection have matured and they have endured … For Australia, the commonwealth is family. And, as with any family, we appreciate our differences … We know the institution is secure in your hands, and we know your commitment to peace and stability will act as your guide during the challenging times in which we find ourselves. PM says king has ‘long apprehended the grave reality of climate change’ Anthony Albanese is now speaking at the parliamentary reception. The prime minister told King Charles that as king, he has “an extraordinary duty to the traditions so carefully upheld, protected and generations of your forbearers, not least your mother, Queen Elizabeth II”. He noted the king’s work towards addressing climate change, and said: Your abiding duty to all that has been built on the foundations of tradition is balanced by a great responsibility to the future – both its serious challenges and its exciting possibilities. You have long apprehended the grave reality of climate change. You take seriously the threat that it represents, as well as the necessity and, crucially, the capability of humanity to take meaningful and effective action against it. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem, sung in English and the local Ngunnawal Indigenous language. Parliamentary reception begins at Parliament House The parliamentary reception, hosted by Anthony Albanese, is beginning in Parliament House. The national anthem was just sung in both English and Ngunnawal language, with Aunty Violet Sheridan welcoming King Charles and Queen Camilla, and guests, to Ngunnawal Country. Sheridan said: A Welcome to Country is a traditional Aboriginal blessing, symbolising the traditional owners of the lands welcoming you. But it also shows your respect for the first peoples of the land you are meeting on. The reason for this custom is to protect your spirit while you are on our land … I’d like to pay my respects to my elders past, present and emerging, and extend that respect to any First Nations people here this morning. But I’d also like to acknowledge all of the non-Indigenous people here as well. In keeping in the general spirit of friendship and reconciliation, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you, King Charles III, and Queen Camilla, and special guest the prime minister, distinguished guests, to the land of the Ngunnawal people. ACT police have confirmed a 62-year-old man was arrested this morning outside the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. The man was arrested for allegedly failing to comply with a police direction. He would be conveyed to the ACT watch house and was expected to be charged, police said. Child allegedly hit with rock through Queensland train window Queensland police are appealing for witnesses after a rock was allegedly thrown through a train window, striking a five-year-old boy in the head. Detectives from the Cairns Child Protection Investigation Unit are investigating the alleged incident on 19 October, that occurred around 4pm near the James and Law Street intersection. The child was taken to Cairns Hospital with serious injuries and was expected to be transported to Townsville Hospital yesterday for further treatment. Police are appealing for witnesses, and anyone with vision, to come forward. Investigations are continuing. A pool reporter has let us know that Queen Camilla is wearing a white silk crepe court dress by Anna Valentine, as well as a diamond and pearl brooch worn previously by Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother. Lidia Thorpe says Indigenous treaty must be part of becoming republic Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe released a statement saying a treaty with First Nations people must be central in any moves towards a republic. Thorpe said she was following the footsteps of her uncle, Robbie Thorpe, who has long advocated for a republic through treaty. She said in a statement there was “unfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic”. We can move towards a Treaty Republic now. The two processes are not opposed, they’re complimentary. As First Peoples, we never ceded our Sovereignty over this land. The Crown invaded this country, has not sought treaty with First Peoples, and committed a Genocide of our people. King Charles is not the legitimate Sovereign of these lands. Any move towards a republic must not continue this injustice. Treaty must play a central role in establishing an independent nation. A republic without a Treaty must not happen. Thorpe turns her back to national anthem Inside the reception hall, Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe has turned her back to the screen while the national anthem was playing. Thorpe is wearing a long possum-skin coat and is standing at the front along the royals’ route into the hall. NSW premier Chris Minns says King Charles ‘seems lovely’ The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, says King Charles III “seems lovely”. At a press conference earlier today, Minns was asked what he thought of the British monarch when they met for the first time in Sydney over the weekend. The King, who has been undergoing treatment for cancer, is midway through a quick Australian visit with his wife, Queen Camilla, their first trip here since his coronation. Minns said: It was really brief, but he seems lovely. And he seemed very happy to be in Sydney. I hope he has a good time in Canberra and in Sydney, it’s obviously a brief visit, and that’s in recognition of the fact that he’s undergoing treatment. I think most people are very happy to have him here, and I’m sure tomorrow will be a great day in Sydney. Royals arrive at Parliament House The King and Queen have arrived at Parliament House in a large motorcade of black SUVs with a police escort on motorbikes. They were greeted with a 21-gun salute that absolutely bewildered the large flock of seagulls that normally swim in the water feature out the front of parliament, with the Federation Guard of military personnel presented for inspection by the King. It’s hot out here – government staffers have been wandering through the gathered crowds, offering sunscreen and water bottles – but the King took the time to walk through the guard for an official inspection, stopping several times to speak to some members of the army and navy gathered in formation. We can’t hear what they said from our vantage point off to the side. The King and Queen are now meeting the official party, including prime minister Anthony Albanese, opposition leader Peter Dutton, governor general Sam Mostyn and other dignitaries. King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived on the forecourt of Parliament House, received by the governor general Sam Mostyn, who presented the prime minister Anthony Albanese. The King is meeting the official greeting party right now, and will soon proceed into Parliament to sign the visitor books alongside the PM, president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. After that, the parliamentary reception will begin. Inside Parliament’s Great Hall, MPs, senators and others with a floor pass for the coming reception are watching the outside arrival proceedings on a big screen and chit-chatting in what is a standing-room morning tea, hurry-up-and-wait kind of scenario. Those in the building who’ve not been so bestowed are crowding around the balconies above the parliamentary foyer, smartphones hoisted, waiting for their majesties to set foot on the marble and glide the few metres towards the hall’s doors and all the folks inside. Me, l’m in the gallery above the supping throng, waiting like everyone else. Until something actually happens, back to you. King Charles III and Queen Camilla have greeted the crowd at the Australian War Memorial, shaking hands and high-fiving kids. The royal couple walked down a cordoned off road leading to the memorial. Queen Camila greeted fans who had waited nearly two hours in the sun on one side while King Charles greeted the other. If you’ll remember earlier in the day, we spoke to Hephner the alpaca and his owner, Robert Fletcher. Hephner was let into the war memorial and got the chance to meet the king. We’re told he sneezed, literally, at the opportunity. Fletcher told Guardian Australia earlier that Hephner wasn’t a spitter but he didn’t rule out sneezing. Crowd grows outside parliament ahead of royal visit Several hundred people have gathered on the Parliament House forecourt ahead of the royal arrival. There’s tight security and members of the military are preparing a ceremonial welcome and 21-gun salute. The crowd, gathered on both edges of the forecourt to see the royal motorcade arrive, is a mix of ages and backgrounds. We found Serena and Gabriella, dressed in suit jackets with Union Jack flags, and a stuffed corgi – famously, the late Queen’s favourites. They were Serena’s husband and their young daughter, Darcy. Serena said: It’s a historic occasion … It’s pretty special. Gabriella donned a cardboard mask of Queen Camilla. Others are dressed in Union Jack clothing, or memorabilia from other royal occasions. Out on the front lawns of Parliament House, far from the official forecourt area, are a few large flags with the slogan “abolish the monarchy”. We can’t see much more from this vantage point, but the yellow flags are visible from the area where the King and Queen will arrive. King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at War Memorial King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived at the Australian War Memorial a few short moments ago where they were greeted by a crowd of a few thousand. The two will lay a wreath at the memorial before greeting members of the crowd and visiting a memorial that commemorates the military service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As the king wound down his window, members of the crowd screamed with joy. One excited crowd member, Carly McCrossin, told the 10 News reporter next to me she kept shouting “I love you, Charles” while holding her young children. Her friends nearby couldn’t believe they’d picked the right side to receive a wave from the king. Small group of protestors at War Memorial ahead of royal visit A small group of protesters set up near the Australian War Memorial earlier to protest the arrival of the royals. Some media had been set up at the Australian War Memorial but we were in fixed positions, so couldn’t get much closer. The crowd was holding Aboriginal and Palestinian flags and calling out “no pride in genocide” and “always was, always will be, Aboriginal land”. Police slowly started directing them away. Crowds growing to catch glimpse of King Charles in Canberra Plenty of visitors to the Australian War Memorial for today’s royal visit have gotten into the spirit. One of those is Lynton Martin, who stood out in the crowd with his bejewelled crown and British flag suit. Martin told Guardian Australia he had already been waiting for around 1.5 hours in line before the gates opened. I got it specifically for the royal tour, and it will now be my royal outfit. I went to the coronation last year in England, and over there, there’s pump, there’s pageantry, there’s colour, there’s passion, it’s everywhere. So I wanted to make the King and Queen feel at home here in Australia. Martin explained his passion for the royal family started was influenced by his grandmother’s love of them. The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, has apologised to almost 1,700 former ground handlers who were illegally sacked and has pledged to engage in prompt negotiations to determine the size of the compensation payout. The apology came after the federal court ruled today that three of those workers should receive a combined $170,000 for non-economic loss suffered, which is to be used as a basis to calculate a total compensation bill. Hudson said in a statement: We sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this. We recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected. Qantas and the Transport Workers’ Union will now engage in mediation over the size of the compensation payout and report back to the court early next month. The total sum is expected to consist of economic and non-economic loss. Separately, the union is also seeking penalties against Qantas. The federal court previously found the airline’s decision to outsource ground handler jobs in 2020 was illegal. But it also ruled that those workers would have been retrenched one year later as Qantas sought to cut costs, limiting the anticipated payout. We love keeping an eye on the federal parliament’s register of interests for any fun updates (financial, property, gifts and hospitality) from our politicians – but deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley might have one of the more interesting disclosures we’ve seen for a while, noting that she has taken out a personal loan to buy her own plane. Ley, who says she got her pilot’s licence at 19, has picked up a Cessna 182, a four-seater, single engine plane. Her register of interests has today been updated to note a “personal loan on purchase of Cessna 182. Creditor: Westpac”. The member for the rural electorate of Farrer, a large area which takes in much of the NSW-Victoria border region, recently got back her pilot’s licence which had lapsed. Ley’s spokesperson said the Cessna was “her favourite aircraft and a reliable working bush aircraft” and that she would use it to travel around her vast electorate. Her electorate of Farrer is 126,500 square kilometres, and one of the largest in the country. It is around the same size as Greece, Bangladesh or Nepal. She is using her plane to help to fly around her electorate at her own expense. Her plane is also a way for her to continue to fly, which is a personal passion for her. She has a passion for aviation which she has spoken about over career and most recently as deputy leader and shadow minister for women. Ley recently told the Nightly newspaper about re-obtaining her pilot’s licence, saying: “This will give me opportunities to fly to parts of my electorate that I wouldn’t normally visit, but I’ve always considered it very important ... I’m always wanting to visit them more.” King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive in Canberra Vision is being broadcast of King Charles and Queen Camilla arriving in Canberra, to cheers from the crowd as they disembark from their plane. We’ll have more in a moment from Sarah Basford Canales, who is on the scene at the Australian War Memorial, where the royals will shortly visit. Allan says she is determined to ‘fight back against Nimby-style approach’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked whether her housing plan is politically motivated – given the vast majority of the suburbs she has earmarked for development are in Liberal-held seats. She denied this, but also had a crack at the opposition in the process: This is about building more homes for more Victorians, because for too long, too many Liberals conservative politicians have chased local votes and blocked the building of more homes in their community. I’m determined to fight for those Victorians who need the government to fight back against this Nimby-style approach. We need to fight back against this approach for the simple reason that it’s just not fair. It’s just not fair on younger Victorians to be denied the opportunity people of my generation and others have had to buy their first home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth. These younger Victorians are being locked out of being able to afford or buy a home, maybe close to where they grew up, close to their family, network of support. They’re being denied choice and opportunity, and that is not fair, and they need someone in their corner fighting for them, and that’s what I and the government will be doing. More on the Victorian stamp-duty announcement The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the scheme will cost the government about $55m and is designed to be a short-term intervention. At the moment, we know that the industry is in a difficult situation, and what they need is the ability to be able to put away these vitally important projects. We expect that over the next 12 months, the material circumstances of the industry will improve. We know, for example, that the spike in commodity prices are already coming off, but they still continue to beset the industry with difficulties. Additionally, I anticipate that we will see – if not by the end of this year, then certainly by early next year – interest rates come down. Now, they won’t come crashing down, but they will come down modestly, is our anticipation. But that will take about another six months before … we do need this period of adjustment and support for the industry, and that’s the rationale behind the 12 months. Victorian premier announcing stamp duty holiday for off-the-plan apartments Victorians buying apartments, townhouses and units off the plan won’t have to pay any stamp duty for 12 months, under a state government initiative aimed at stimulating development. The premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing the policy, which comes into effect immediately and will be open to all buyers for properties of any price point. Currently, stamp duty concessions on off-the-plan properties are only available to first-home buyers and owner occupiers and are capped at $750,000 and $550,000, respectively The government estimates the policy will cut the stamp duty of buyers of a new $620,000 apartment down to just $4,000, a saving of $28,000. Speaking at a recently opened build-to-rent project in North Fitzroy, Allan said the move responds to feedback from the construction industry that the current interest rate burden has slowed sales and stopped developments from beginning. It will get more of these projects away sooner. And what that means [is] that [it] unlocks more homes for everyone. More homes, more opportunities – whether you want to live in an apartment, a unit or a townhouse. It provides more opportunities for more Victorians to be able to find a home where they want to live. Nick McIntosh argued that law reform is still needed, calling for the establishment of a Safe and Secure Skies Commission – for “independent oversight over the entire aviation industry”. We should never have been in this position. These workers really should have their jobs back as we speak. The problem was that the law didn’t allow that to happen. It was too difficult to reinstate 1,700 workers – it was alright if it was two workers, but 1,700 was too much. That needed to change as well so that if this ever happens again – and let’s hope it doesn’t – but if this ever happens again, these workers will have their jobs back. We won’t be going through years and years of high court challenges, we’ll have these workers back doing what they do best. Union estimates compensation will exceed $100m The assistant secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, Nick McIntosh, also spoke with the media following the court decision. Taking questions, he said the union estimates the compensation figure is “probably worth in excess of $100m”. Clearly it’s going to be dependent on different individual cases. The really crucial element, though, is this non-economic loss. This is tax-free money that is in recognition of people’s hardship and distress suffered. This will make a big difference to every one of the 1,700 people, but we do [think] this will be a global figure in excess of $100m. Workers welcome court decision on Qantas outsourcing Damien Pollard, another illegally outsourced worker, told reporters that he was “an extremely proud” Qantas worker and expected to be there until he retired: I’ve spent the last four years fielding hundreds of phone calls from my members in Canberra, people that are going through personal problems and mental health issues that were caused by this decision. So today’s judgment by Justice Lee goes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives. Sacked Qantas worker reacts to court decision Don Dixon, one of the illegally outsourced workers with Qantas, spoke with the media and said this was a victory for “ordinary Australian workers”. He said working for Qantas was like a family – so today’s decision is “sad in one way but it’s jubilant in all other ways”: We stood up and we fought. Every Australian now should say, you know what – this is [the] spirit of Australia. You dig in when it gets tough, and you don’t give up and here we are today having a massive victory. Dixon said that “so many families struggled” throughout the campaign and “losing your job as quickly and as brutally as it was, it was a horrible thing”: We thought we were there for the rest of our lives. Most of us are getting on in years, so getting another job out in the harsh world was very, very difficult. So this compensation will go a long way of paying people’s mortgages and giving them some hope that all isn’t lost when you group together and you have that fight. A federal court judge has rebuked Qantas for the “vast legal costs” expended to defend claims it illegally sacked almost 1,700 ground handlers in 2020, as former workers move a step closer towards a compensation payout. Justice Michael Lee has ruled that three test cases should each receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000 each. They suffered varying amounts of “non-economic loss”, the court ruled. Justice Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers Union into mediation using the test case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to Qantas’ “laser-like” focus on cutting costs, limiting compensation to the twelve months following the outsourcing decision. You can read the full story below: Trainee doctors rate training experience ‘pass’ at best in survey Trainees rated their training experience a “pass” at best in 2023, a survey from the peak body for doctors reveals. Just over one in five respondents didn’t feel comfortable raising bullying, harassment and discrimination with their college and only over half felt safe raising training and wellbeing concerns. Dr Sanjay Hettige, Council of Doctors in training chair described these figures as “far too low”, warranting greater attention from medical colleges. Only 4 in 10 trainees reported receiving useful feedback from their college, which Hettige said had a “huge impact on trainee health and wellbeing”. Almost 8 in 10 rural based trainees wanted to stay in rural practice, but only a third of metropolitan based trainees said they would consider moving to rural practice. Hettige said that greater exposure to rural training could help solve the rural doctor shortage, but graduates often have “no choice but to go to the big cities”. Unless greater focus is given to creating more rural training opportunities, this trend will continue at the detriment of patients in rural and regional Australia. People already lining up at Parliament House ahead of royal visit It’s still hours before the King and Queen arrive at Parliament House, but eager royal watchers have already been lining up for some time on the building’s forecourt. Before Parliament House staff closed up the front of the building for security reasons, we spotted around 50 people already lined up to get close to the royals; some prepared for the long haul with camp chairs and sandwiches, others bearing flowers and gifts. One family arrived wearing gold plastic crowns. There’s people of all ages, young and old, including a few kids that look like they’ve gotten the day off school to catch a glimpse of Charles and Camilla. We’ll bring you more from Parliament House later this afternoon. Brittany Higgins speaks on risks to baby during ‘acutely stressful pregnancy’ Brittany Higgins, who is currently pregnant, says that her baby is “perfectly fine and healthy” after a blood test raised red flags in the second trimester. In a post to Instagram, Higgins said it is an “understatement to say that we’ve had an acutely stressful pregnancy”, with her and her husband, David Sharaz, having the “scare of [their] lives” with a recent blood test: Our baby had a high probability of a genetic disorder – which wouldn’t have mattered to us – but scarily could mean he may be incompatible with life outside of the womb. After an amniocentesis and a seemingly never-ending wait our prayers were answered. Our little guy is perfectly fine and healthy. Higgins said she wanted to talk about this as it “takes the stigma out of these very real circumstances that people are faced with when trying to start families”. Meanwhile, Higgins and Sharaz have still not sold their French home. Higgins said in July that she was being forced to sell the home to defend the defamation action brought by the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. Alpaca joins crowd awaiting royal couple At Canberra’s Australian War Memorial, territorians are lining up to catch a glimpse of the king and queen’s first pitstop in the nation’s capital. One of those in line is Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner. Hephner sported a sparkly gold crown and bow tie, with a blue velvet suit (see our previous post for some photos). And he was on his best behaviour, Fletcher said. We just thought, what an opportunity to dress him up as royalty and bring him today. Hephner is a monarchist, Fletcher said, and would love to meet King Charles III and Queen Camilla. I think this is probably the last opportunity that you’ll ever get to see them, certainly in my lifetime and probably my daughter’s lifetime as well. The gates opened at 10.30am, but whether Hephner with his human family will be allowed to pass through remains to be seen. People lining up to see King and Queen at War Memorial King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia, with their first stop today at the War Memorial in Canberra. Mike Bowers is there to capture all the action, and people are already lining up to catch a glimpse of the royals, including Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner: You can have a read of the full royal itinerary below: Extreme fire danger for west coast of South Australia There is an extreme fire danger rating for the west coast of South Australia today. The Bureau of Meteorology says hot and dry conditions, with gusty north-westerly winds forecast ahead of a cooler, south-westerly change this afternoon and evening. Here’s a look at today’s weather forecasts across Australia’s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Proposals are being sought to deliver more visitors, live performances and events, a statement from the NSW government said. It is also seeking proposals for additional creative spaces that could host up to 20,000 people. The state government said the EQ is one of Sydney’s key entertainment and sports precincts but is “currently underutilised”, considering its location between Centennial Park, the SCG and Allianz Stadium, and proximity to the CBD via the light rail. The current lease has a maximum term expiring in 2046 and the open-tender will allow all parties to put forward proposals. The open tender will commence in the “near-term” and run through next year. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement that the EQ was “falling far short of meeting its full potential”: We want to turn the EQ into a thriving world-class precinct, full of dining and entertainment options, complete with a brand new venue that can host between 15,000 to 20,000 for live music and public events … From cutting through red tape that has decimated Sydney’s nightlife to getting visitors and entertainment back into the city with projects this like this, we’re focused on turning Sydney into the best entertainment destination in the world. Every Victorian who buys off-the-plan apartments, units and townhouses will have their stamp duty slashed, AAP reports, but only for a limited time. The premier, Jacinta Allan, announced Victorian stamp duty concessions would be expanded to all buyers and uncapped. Thresholds for stamp duty concessions had previously been set at $750,000 and $550,000 for first home buyers and owner-occupiers respectively. But eligibility has been expanded to investors and the value cap removed for one year from today, providing a 100% discount for outstanding construction and refurbishment costs when calculating stamp duty. Allan said the 12-month stimulus plan was in response to under-pressure builders crying out for help after successive interest rate rises. She told Sunrise earlier: It’s certainly having an impact on the housing industry. That’s why we’re providing this support. It’s good for builders, it’s certainly good for buyers who will save money, it’s good for building more homes. The premier foreshadowed she would release more housing policies and initiatives across the rest of the week. Bowen underscores gas won’t be included in any capacity scheme The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been taking questions after his speech, confirming he wouldn’t include gas into the capacity investment scheme (that was set up speed up the renewables’ rollout). Bowen noted NSW had included gas in its long-term auction system, and noted that no gas operator had bothered to bid “because it is so expensive”. Hence, putting gas into the federal scheme “achieves nothing” because such project would never get support. “It’s just a distraction,” he said. (His federal counterpart, Ted O’Brien, had argued last week: “The inclusion of gas in the CIS is crucial to addressing the immediate challenges in Australia’s gas market, ensuring reliable electricity supply, and stabilising energy prices.”) Bowen, meanwhile, downplayed reports in the past week or so in the Murdoch tabloids and the AFR about Norway’s Equinor pulling out of the running for a proposed offshore windfarm zone near Illawarra. He noted that Equinor had announced its exit from the race back in June (and hence, wondered why it was being repeated). The company was still in the running for a zone planned for the offshore Hunter River, up the NSW coast, and the much larger zone off the Gippsland coast was going “gangbusters”. As we anticipated, that second round of the CIS is only an acceleration (albeit a significant one). The overall size of the scheme will not be expanded, Bowen’s office has confirmed. Meanwhile, Bowen hinted the government won’t be releasing its 2035 emissions targets this side of the election. He would be taking advice from the Climate Change Authority (now chaired by Matt Kean, the former NSW treasurer and energy minister in a Liberal-led coalition). No nation had yet lodged 2035 carbon cuts to the UN body (the UNFCCC), Bowen noted. Perhaps Australia won’t be in a hurry to sign up. Andrew Barr speaks following election win in ACT The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier after his election win over the weekend. Barr, already the longest-serving political leader in the country, fended off a negative swing and an independent surge to win his third election as chief minister. He noted swings against some incumbent parties, including Labor, and said “there are always lessons to learn from each election campaign”: It is looking increasingly certain of 10 Labor and three Green [seats], with a possibility of an additional seat either going to Labor or Green in the southern electorate of Brindabella. But there’s postal votes and interstate votes that will need to be added to that count. We would hope this would be resolved by the end of the week. Responding to accusations that Labor is dominating the jurisdiction, Barr argued that “power is always shared in the ACT” with crossbenchers: In this instance, we will expect a crossbench of at least five and possibly six members out of our 25-member assembly. But they have generally represented progressive views. The Canberra Liberals are the most right-wing branch of the Liberal party in this country, and that’s been ably demonstrated election after election … We don’t make any apologies for running successful campaigns. Barr argued that “votes were quite sharply weaker for the Liberal party” after its leader, Elizabeth Lee, was caught giving the middle finger to a journalist. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, says the government will accelerate the pace of its capacity investment scheme, an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Bowen has told an AFR energy conference in Sydney that its second round of investments has been lifted to 6GW of new renewable generation from 4GW. Storage (mostly big batteries) will be lifted to 4GW from an original 2GW. He said: I expected it to work well, and it’s working better than I thought. The scheme guarantees a minimum payment for the power supply – but if wholesale prices are higher than a certain level, the government would take a share of the cut. It’s not clear if the acceleration of the plans means the overall scheme will be larger than anticipated. Perhaps there’s also an insurance element. Auction results can’t be overturned if the government were to change at the next election. The Coalition has said it wants to introduce gas in the scheme (something that states such as Victoria had opposed in the past). Plans for seven nuclear power plants are unlikely to gain market interest to include them in any action, given most reports estimate such generation to be far more expensive than wind or solar (even with storage added). Bowen said uncertainty in the industry was something the Coalition was “deliberately” creating by introducing nuclear proposals to Australia’s mix. Bowen said he remains confident that the government can meet its 2030 goal of supplying 82% of electricity from clean energy sources. Bowen noted too that some parts of the grid had record minimum demand on the grid over the weekend, something we touched a week or so ago here: Byelection results reflect shift away from major parties: Ryan Monique Ryan was also asked about Jacqui Scruby’s election results in Pittwater at the weekend, and if they makes her feel more comfortable ahead of the next federal election regarding retaining her own seat. She said: [Almost] a third of Australians did not vote for the major parties [in 2022], I don’t think we have seen anything since that time that’s changed their minds. I think people are seeing that independents can hold the governments to account at all levels of government. We play an important role, we’re pragmatic and centrist and we contribute. The results from the elections over the weekend reflected that. Ryan says Allan ‘playing politics’ with Nimby-ism suggestion Monique Ryan was also asked about suggestions from the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, that part of the opposition to the rezoning plan is “Nimby-ism”. Ryan accused the premier of “playing politics with this” and said she is “trying to create a point of difference:” I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in ensuring … these developments will be [designed] in a way that’s sensible and sustainable, they’ll be delivered on time … and we’ll retain the character of the suburbs in which we’ve chosen to live, while welcoming hopefully hundreds of thousands of new people into the area. Independent Kooyong MP responds to Victorian government rezoning plan Monique Ryan, the federal member for Kooyong, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss the Victorian government’s rezoning plan: Ryan has been quoted in the Financial Review as saying new developments proposed by the Allan government could result in buildings that were too tall, ugly, and slow to be delivered. She responded to this, and said: The announcement this weekend from the premier was for nine massive new developments just in the electorate of Kooyong. That’s huge. These could be up to 20 storeys high. Of course that will cause some concern from people who live in the area, who have chosen to live there, because it’s a beautiful part of the world. Ryan said that people need “certainty” their kids will still get into local schools and that they won’t lose green spaces and amenities, and that more detail is needed on the plan. We’re not saying we don’t want it, I think people in my part of the world are welcoming it. We’d also like some assurances from the government they will include social and affordable housing in these developments. We really don’t have any detail as of yet and that’s the stuff that’s missing at this point. Teal independent speaks following byelection results at the weekend The independent Jacqui Scruby, a Climate 200-backed former adviser to federal MPs Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps, is set to win the Pittwater byelection in NSW. She spoke with ABC RN this morning and said “of course” her results are “part of a broader trend” towards independents, and “people wanting a different type of politics”: So this representation that is community representation, rather than party representation, and also the ability for independence, I think, to work across party lines, hold governments’ to account, but also work collaboratively with governments in order to deliver … I’ve earned the trust of traditional Liberal voters, and I will seek to maintain that trust and gain the trust of others. Scruby argued that people are “sick of divisive politics” and are “looking for representation that is not divisive, that’s really practical”: And it’s a bit more nuanced as well, because part of community representation is bringing people into their democracy and helping them understand the nuance of policies, rather than … opposition for the sake of opposition. Scruby said that in the three NSW byelections, the Liberal candidates that were chosen didn’t live in their electorate – and “how that played … maybe is a lesson to the Liberal party”. Shadow housing minister responds to business call for $10bn housing reform While on ABC RN, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, was also asked about calls from the Business Council for a $10bn federal plan to cut the cost of construction. You can read all the details on this below: The business council is calling an increase in foreign workers with construction skills. Sukkar was asked: how can the Coalition back this if it wants to cut the number of permanent visas? Sukkar argued that “you’ve got to reorientate the composition of who you bring in”: In recent times, we’ve had the Labor party bringing in more yoga instructors than bricklayers … We’ve made clear we’re going to reduce migration to free up 100,000 homes for Australians. Now you can simultaneously ensure that of the generous migration program that Australia does have in place, that you reorientate it to the sorts of skills we need. The government and the opposition have both promised cuts to migration in response, at least partially, to Australia’s housing crisis. But how much does immigration actually contribute to the cost of housing and rent? You can read more on this below: Shadow housing minister critical of rollout of Victorian rezoning announcement The shadow minister for housing, Michael Sukkar, was up on ABC RN this morning to speak on the Victorian government’s rezoning plan, as we flagged earlier: Sukkar criticised the state government for a lack of consultation with the community and said: If you’re going to make any of these sorts of investments or changes, you’ve got to consult with the people who are affected now … For people to wake up one morning and read that there’s going to be a 20 story tower next door to them, I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they’re a bit crazy … That’s the first I’ve heard [and] that’s the problem with this announcement, there’s been no discussion with the community. Classroom mobile ban hailed success by NSW government The NSW government’s decision to ban mobile phones in thousands of public school classrooms has been hailed a success, AAP reports. An education department survey of almost 1,000 public school principals found huge support for the ban, with 95% reporting positive results. The premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement today that one year in “it’s clear, this was the right decision”: Without the distraction of a mobile phone in their pockets, students have been able to focus on their learning, while building stronger relationships with their classmates. The survey also found 81% of principals agreed students’ learning had improved, 87% said students were less distracted in the classroom and 86% said socialising had improved. The ban was introduced at the beginning of term four in 2023. Allan calls out opposition to housing plan Jacinta Allan said that “Nimby-ism” – aka a “Not In My Back Yard” approach to new housing – was “one way to describe” how opponents to her plan are feeling. She told ABC News Breakfast that for too long, “too many politicians have not addressed this key fundamental issue which is why we’ve got to this point.” We’ve got to this point because the loudest voices, who don’t necessarily represent all of the community, have particularly got in the way of building new homes. They’ve been the blockers. They’re particularly Liberal members of parliament, like we saw yesterday in Brighton, and we’ve got Monique Ryan, who is not Liberal. We have residents who are not necessarily Liberal members either. Yesterday, angry Brighton residents surrounded the pub where Allan announced the housing plan to media, chanting: “Shame, premier, shame.” Allan said what she would talk to the community about is whether it “makes sense to have taller buildings hugging the train station itself, being close to the train station, and then having lower levels as you move away from the train stations”: … we’re going to embark on a consultation, community by community, street by street, house by house. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been speaking with ABC News Breakfast about a plan to create 50 new “activity zones” to help deliver more than 30,000 additional homes across Melbourne by 2051. Defending the plan, she said that more homes need to be built in the state, particularly for younger Victorians under 40: Anyone under the age of 40 knows just how tough it is to find a home, particularly to find a home close to where they grew up, close to families. We need to get on and build more homes, particularly in and around the suburbs of Melbourne. Allan was asked about pushback from locals, including those in Brighton, and whether she should have spoken with residents. She said 25 zoning locations had been announced, with another 25 to come, and “we’re going to get on and talk to people in those local communities.” I know from my conversations with many Victorians that putting homes next to a train station just makes sense for so many people … The status quo is just not an option any more. It’s tougher and tougher for younger people to get into a home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth that previous generations have had that opportunity to. We’ve got to get on and find new ways to push on and build more homes, because the status quo is locking out too many people. Bid to avoid post-2032 homelessness in Queensland There are fears Brisbane could be heading toward a post-2032 Olympic Games homelessness crisis if the next state government does not take action, AAP reports. The warning comes after a Q Shelter-commissioned Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute report on the Olympics’ impact on homelessness and the local housing market. Q Shelter’s CEO, Fiona Caniglia, said the “best-case scenario is people will be pushed out to the regions”. But if you live here now and for reasons that are important to you, like work and family, then we need to create a framework so you can stay, and so you’re not forced to move because of the impact of the games. Reports will be published annually leading up to the 2032 games to monitor housing market conditions and the responses to homelessness in Brisbane. The aim is to help calibrate policy responses to ensure Brisbane 2032 delivers its intended legacy of social inclusion. However, Q Shelter said it was not out of the realm of possibility that Brisbane could be the first games host that doesn’t worsen homelessness. This could be done through legacy planning, including repurposing the athletes’ village into social housing. Overnight, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “the worst is behind us” when it comes to inflation. Speaking to 7News’ Spotlight program, he said the peak in inflation was now “in the rear-view mirror, and we’re not complacent about that”. But we are confident that, having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. Asked whether that meant interest rates would come down before a potential election next May, Chalmers said there was “really good reasons for treasurers of either political persuasion not to make predictions about interest rate movements”. The market expects that there will be interest rate cuts in 2025 … as treasurer, I’ve been very careful not to make those kinds of predictions. Chalmers said that Australia “came quite close” to recession in the first two quarters of this year, and that growth was “very, very flat” in March and June. And if I’m honest with you … there were times where we feared that the economy would go backwards. But if you’re asking me, was I worried at the time? Too right I was … There were some moments in the lead up to the release of [the national accounts] where there was a very substantial risk that the economy might have gone backwards. A lot of relief when we discovered that it hadn’t. Good morning, and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage this Monday. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said that “the worst is behind us” when it comes to inflation. Speaking on 7News’ Spotlight program last night, he said: When it comes to inflation specifically, the worst is behind us … The peak in inflation is now in the rear-view mirror and we’re not complacent about that, we’re cautious about that, but we are confident that having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. We’ll bring you more from his interview in a moment. Meanwhile, King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia as part of their first visit to the country since Charles became its reigning monarch. This morning, the couple will visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and the prime minister will host a reception at Parliament House. The king will meet firefighters and bushfire researchers at CSIRO, while Camilla will meet the founder of the charity donations platform GIVIT. There will also be a tour of the National Botanical Gardens.

                    "bodyText": "Imagine someone drives up to a pub in a top-of-the-range sports car – a £1.5m Koenigsegg Regera, to pick one at random – parks up and saunters out of the vehicle. They come into the pub you’re drinking in and begin walking around its patrons, slipping their hand into your pocket in full view, smiling at you as they take out your wallet and empty it of its cash and cards. The not-so-subtle pickpocket stops if you shout and ask what the hell they’re doing. “Sorry for the inconvenience,” the pickpocket says. “It’s an opt-out regime, mate.” Sounds absurd. Yet it seems to be the approach the government is pursuing in order to placate AI companies. A consultation is soon to open, the Financial Times reports, that will allow AI companies to scrape content from individuals and organisations unless they explicitly opt out of their data being used. The AI revolution has been as all encompassing as it has been rapid. Even if you’re not one of the 200 million people who log on to ChatGPT every week, or dabble with its generative AI competitors such as Claude and Gemini, you will undoubtedly have interacted with an AI system – knowingly or unknowingly. But the fire of AI needs two constantly replenishing sources in order to survive and not burn out. One is energy – which is why AI companies are getting into the business of buying nuclear power plants. And the other is data. Data is vital to AI systems because it helps them to develop facsimiles of how we interact. If AI has any “knowledge” – and that’s highly disputed, given it’s really a fancy pattern-matching machine – then it stems from the data on which it is trained. One study forecast that large language models such as ChatGPT will run out of training data by 2026, so voracious is its appetite. Yet, without that data, the AI revolution may stall. Tech companies know that, which is why they are penning licensing deals for content left, right and centre. But that introduces friction, and a sector whose unofficial motto for the past decade or more has been “move fast and break things” doesn’t do friction. Which is why they are already trying to nudge us towards an opt-out approach to copyright, where everything we type, post and share is destined to become AI training data by default unless we say no, rather than an opt-in regime, where companies have to ask us to use our data. We can already see how companies are priming us for this reality: this week, X began notifying users of a change to its terms and conditions of use that would enable all posts to be used to train Grok, Elon Musk’s AI model designed to compete with ChatGPT. And Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has made a similar change – resulting in the viral “Goodbye Meta AI” urban legend that supposedly overrides legal agreements. The reason AI companies want an opt-out regime is obvious: if you ask most people if they want anything from the books they write or music they produce, or the posts and photos they share on social networks, to be used to train AI, they’ll say no. And then the wheels come off the AI revolution. The reason governments want to enable such a change to the concept of copyright ownership that has existed for more than 300 years, and has been enshrined in law for more than 100, is less obvious. But like many things, it seems to come down to money. The government has been confronted with lobbying from big tech companies suggesting that this is a requirement for them to consider the country as a place to invest in and share the spoils of AI innovation. One lobbying document penned by Google suggested backing its approach for an opt-out copyright regime would “ensure the UK can be a competitive place to develop and train AI models in the future”. The government’s mooted framing of the issue, which already puts the opt-out approach on the table as the method to be argued against, is therefore a big win for big tech lobbyists. With the amount of money washing around the tech sector and the levels of investment being thrown at AI projects, it’s unsurprising Keir Starmer doesn’t want to miss out on the potential bounty available. The government would be remiss not to consider how to appease tech companies as they develop a world-changing technology, and to try to make the UK an AI powerhouse. But this isn’t the answer. Let’s be clear: the UK’s mooted copyright scheme would effectively enable companies to nick our data – every post we make, every book we write, every song we create – with impunity. It would require us to sign up to every individual service and tell them that no, we don’t want them to chew up our data and spit out a poor composite image of us. Potentially hundreds of them, from big tech companies to small research labs. Lest we forget, OpenAI – a company now valued at more than $150bn – is planning to forswear its founding non-profit principles to become a for-profit company. It has more than enough money in its coffers to pay for training data, rather than rely on the beneficence of the general public. Companies like that can certainly afford to put their hands in their own pockets, rather than ours. So hands off.

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. Yesterday, Israel confirmed that its forces had killed the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, architect of the 7 October attacks against Israel that killed 1,200 people and in which a further 250 were taken hostage. After a year-long manhunt, Israeli media reported that Sinwar, a prime target for Israel, had been killed “by chance” by regular IDF soldiers – not as the result of a targeted operation. Sinwar was reportedly killed in combat alongside two other militants on Wednesday in the city of Rafah. Israeli troops took Sinwar’s body to Israel for DNA and dental record testing. Once there was confirmation of his identity, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government celebrated the death of Sinwar as the “beginning of the end” but made clear that the war, which has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, is not over: “The mission ahead of us is still unfinished.” Today’s newsletter goes through the latest in the Middle East, and what Yahya Sinwar’s death could mean for the war in Gaza. That’s right after the headlines. • This item was amended on 18 October 2024. An earlier version said 1,200 Israeli civilians were killed in the 7 October 2023 attacks. While the majority were civilians, a minority were military personnel.

In depth: Why it may not mean the dawning of the ‘day after’ Every day that the war in Gaza continues, civilians face death and contend with catastrophic conditions. Just yesterday, reports emerged of an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 28 people sheltering in a school in Gaza City. The attack comes amid accusations Israel is attempting to forcibly expel the remaining population in a renewed ground campaign in the north of the territory. Earlier this week, widely shared footage showed Shaban al-Dalou, a teenage Palestinian, who was attached to an IV drip burning to death in a blaze caused by an Israeli strike on a hospital in Gaza. Sinwar’s death will renew hopes for a ceasefire, but there seems to be little appetite in Israel’s government for the war to end. Benny Gantz, an opposition politician, said Israel’s military “will continue to operate in the Gaza Strip for years to come”. *** Who was Yahya Sinwar? The elusive leader of Hamas managed to evade death for the last year, hiding mostly in tunnels in Gaza, despite being the Israeli military’s number one target since the 7 October attacks. Sinwar was born in a refugee camp in Khan Younis in 1962. His family had been forced to flee and became refugees in 1948 during what Palestinians call the Nakba (catastrophe). Sinwar became an Islamist activist and joined Hamas in the 1980s when it first formed. He was arrested not long afterwards and given four life sentences for attempted murder and sabotage. Sinwar spent 22 years in Israeli jails, where he learned Hebrew and read Israeli news. After he was released in a prisoner swap in 2011, he married, had children and returned to Hamas. For more detail on the life and aims of Sinwar, read Jason Burke’s comprehensive profile of the Hamas leader. *** What’s next for Hamas? Yahya Sinwar’s younger brother, Mohammed, is believed to still be alive and highly influential – and a natural successor. Another candidate is Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas in Gaza, who has been one of the lead negotiators during ceasefire talks in Qatar. The third potential option is Khaled Mashal, a former political head of Hamas. Regardless of who will succeed Sinwar, Hamas will be in disarray. The casualties sustained among its fighters and the gutting of its leadership mean it will not be easy to recover for the militant group. *** What does this mean for a ceasefire? Comparing the assassination to that of Osama bin Laden, the US president, Joe Biden, said Sinwar’s death was a “good day” for the world. Biden and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, added that Israel must use the moment of his killing to negotiate the return of remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza “once and for all”. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany – Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz – all have publicly urged to Israel to work towards a ceasefire. Iran on the other hand said the killing would strengthen the “spirit of resistance” and Sinwar would be seen as “a model for the youth and children who will carry forward his path toward the liberation of Palestine”. Hezbollah responded by announcing “the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel”. There is growing pressure inside Israel to ensure the safe return of the hostages – on Thursday hundreds gathered in Tel Aviv to call for their release – and such pressure is likely to grow in the coming days. While Sinwar’s death removes a significant hurdle for ceasefire negotiations, it does not necessarily mean an end to the violence. “Even if Israel did decide to declare victory in Gaza with the death of Sinwar – something that analysts have long predicted – it may not mean the dawning of the ‘day after’,” Jason Burke writes in his analysis. “Israeli officials have made clear their military control and operations will continue in Gaza for as long as they deem them necessary, and no one has yet come up with a new political set-up in Gaza that might be acceptable to all parties.” Netanyahu’s political position is only further fortified by Sinwar’s death, continuing a turnaround after a year of chronic unpopularity. Recently the prime minister was already riding a political boost after the assassinations of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief (this explainer lays out the senior Hamas leaders and other militants who have been killed since the beginning of the war in Gaza). It is of course too soon to be sure of the full consequences of this moment in the war – but it will probably mark a shift in this bloody conflict.

Something for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read and listen to right now Music Kelly Lee Owens: Dreamstate | ★★★★☆ Initially, you worry that a desire to communicate to a broader audience has led Owens to smooth out the idiosyncrasies that made her previous albums so effective: opener Dark Angel and Sunshine feel not unlike a more tasteful, Instagram-filter take on the big, hollow sound of late 90s Gatecrasher trance. But as Dreamstate progresses, it becomes apparent that Owens (above) is just deploying her idiosyncrasies more subtly than before. The results feel pop-facing without resorting to pop-dance cliches. The album largely achieves its multifunctional aims. Whether it can turn Owens into an actual pop star is unclear, but perhaps that’s not the point: after all, given her past form, the follow-up will most likely be completely different. Alexis Petridis TV Mr Loverman | ★★★★☆ Adapted from the Booker prize-winning author Bernardine Evaristo’s novel, Mr Loverman is about what it means to have a good life built on lies. Barry Jedidiah Walker is a charming 74-year-old dandy and a successful businessman, husband, beloved father and grandfather. He is also the secret lover, for 50 years and counting, of Morris De La Roux. This is a different, spikier, much braver tale about the Windrush generation than usually makes it on to our screens. There is closeness, vibrancy, violence and sorrow in the mix, plus an examination of many forms of love and how they can either strengthen or warp under pressure. It is more of a mood piece than an action-packed drama, with closeups of human life, and all its exquisite agonies and joys, portrayed by actors at the top of their game. Lucy Mangan Film Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare | ★★★☆☆ Though thankfully not stretched into multiple episodes, Sweet Bobby, at 82 minutes, is the rare case of a true crime documentary that could be longer. The big reveal (no spoiler) is swift, and the resolution barely teased out. Sweet Bobby easily accomplishes shock – I screamed at my laptop – though that largely owes to the truly unhinged raw material. Ultimately, Sweet Bobby leaves more questions than answers, though as is the unfortunate case with many catfishing scams, sometimes there are none.

But what if Japanese people’s lives are actually much more messy and cluttered than we think?

                    "bodyText": "The UK’s national institute for artificial intelligence and data science has launched a consultation process that could lead to redundancies among its 440 staff. In a memo sent to staff this month the Alan Turing Institute gave an update on its new strategy, under which it will concentrate on fewer projects. It was addressed to “affected employees” and stated that the government-backed institute “may need to consider making redundancies”. According to informal calculations by staff, the memo could have been sent to as many as 140 people. The internal document said the institute – which carries out research with universities, the private sector and government entities – was working on 111 live projects and needed to “move away from engaging in large numbers of individual projects”. Last year the institute unveiled a new strategy dubbed “Turing 2.0” in which it would focus on three key areas: health, the environment, and defence and security. However, the organisation said there was now “less core funding than was assumed when the strategy was written”. It said the institute had examined which of the 111 projects were “strategically aligned” to the Turing 2.0 drive and launched a process that could involve spinning out or closing the projects. “This means regrettably that we may need to consider making redundancies,” the memo said. It said it would explore ways of avoiding compulsory redundancies and hold elections from employee representatives in discussions. The consultancy process with employees is expected to end in February next year. The institute’s chief executive, Dr Jean Innes, told the Guardian: “The Turing’s purpose is to make great leaps in the development and use of data science and AI in order to change the world for the better and in line with this we are shaping an ambitious new phase for the institute as we aim to use these technologies to tackle some of the biggest issues facing society.” The institute, named after the British mathematician widely considered the father of modern computing, was founded in 2015 as a national institute for data science before adding AI to its remit in 2017. Its goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick. The possibility of job cuts at the institute comes as the government prepares to make two key announcements about the technology. It is preparing to launch an “AI action plan” under the tech entrepreneur Matt Clifford that will look at how AI can spur economic growth and improve public services. It is also set to release a consultation on an AI bill which will reportedly focus on making a voluntary AI model testing agreement between the UK government and tech companies legally binding, as well as making the UK’s AI Safety Institute – an organisation separate to the Turing – an arm’s length government body."

Staff ‘furious’ as ANU announces more job cuts The Australian National University has announced a further 108 job losses after earlier this month cutting 50 positions, leaving staff “furious”. The ANU revealed the changes today as part of ongoing restructure efforts, which will also see 21 new roles created. The university on Tuesday also asked staff to forgo an agreed pay rise to save jobs, which the National Tertiary Education Union’s ACT Division Secretary Dr Lachlan Clohesy claimed would not work: It is staggering that a Vice Chancellor thinks they can convince staff that giving up their pay will save jobs, while at the same time announcing further job cuts. The NTEU ANU branch president, Millan Pintos-Lopez, said ANU staff were “furious that a vice-chancellor is promising to save jobs while cutting them”. Last week the ANU Council gave directions to the chancellery to reduce the university’s recurring cost base by $250m by the end of 2025, including $100m in staff expenditure. The NTEU estimated that a $100m cut will end up leaving a total of 638 full-time equivalent staff out of work. An ANU spokesperson said staff affected by the proposed changes had been advised prior to today’s staff meetings. In an email to the community, the vice-chancellor, Genevieve Bell, encouraged staff to engage in consultation processes and seek support: I urge you to seek support in whatever form you need – including the staff supports provided through our wellbeing teams. Change can be deeply unsettling, and the safety and wellbeing of staff is of paramount importance. You can read more on ANU’s finances below: We have some breaking news at the conclusion of that press conference. Two lanes of the Sydney Harbour Bridge have been reopened after extensive delays, the coordinator-general of Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, has confirmed. Just as the press conference was wrapping up, Collins was alerted traffic was resuming in a limited fashion on the bridge. But he warned with cars backed up for 12km, it was best for drivers to avoid the bridge and take diverted routes. Jordan Rosser, NSW Ambulance’s acting zone manager for Sydney, said a helicopter came to the scene of the Sydney Harbour Bridge crash and assessed four people at the scene. They found two people deceased and a further two people were transported to Royal North Shore hospital in a stable condition. Drivers told to ‘avoid the area’ of Harbour Bridge NSW authorities are urging Sydneysiders to avoid the area around the Sydney Harbour Bridge after today’s crash. Both north and southbound lanes remain closed. The coordinator-general of Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, told the press conference the traffic may be protracted even if lanes open to clear for the afternoon peak. NSW government employee arrested over alleged sexual assaults Police allege a man used his position as a NSW government employee to arrange for two women to meet him, where they were sexually assaulted. The man, aged 54, will face court today in Penrith after being arrested this morning at a home in Windsor, on Sydney’s north-western edge. He was taken to the local police station and refused bail. Police were investigating reports that a 41-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in August. During the investigation, detectives spoke with a 55-year-old woman who was allegedly sexually assaulted at a Concord home in March. The man is charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, carry out sexual act with another without consent, and intentionally record intimate image without consent. NSW police are also holding a press conference this hour with more information about the fatal crash which has closed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Our reporter Caitlin Cassidy is at that press conference and informs us a 28-year-old man is in hospital in a stable condition. Motorcyclist arrested at Harbour Bridge crime scene A motorcyclist has also been arrested for allegedly riding through the crime scene at the Harbour Bridge, police say: As emergency services were treating those at the scene, a motorcyclist allegedly rode through the crime scene. He was arrested and taken to Day Street Police Station where he is assisting with inquiries. A second person has died after the crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, police say. Emergency services were called to the bridge at about 1.40pm on Thursday, where they found three cars and a bus had collided. Police confirmed one man died at the scene and a second was in a critical condition. In a statement released just now police said a second person had now died: NSW Ambulance paramedics have treated multiple people for injuries; however, two men died at the scene. They have not yet been formally identified. The bus driver was uninjured, and no passengers were on board at the time. Bombshell report reveals systemic bullying and harassment at Nine We mentioned earlier the independent review commissioned by Nine Entertainment was due today. That report is now out and has revealed systemic bullying and harassment – you can read the full story from Amanda Meade: People ‘languishing’ in hospital while waiting for NDIS care Hundreds of people with disabilities are “languishing” in public hospitals while they wait for adequate support, leaving them vulnerable to harm and infection, AAP reports. Workforce shortages and a lack of disability accommodation in rural areas has led to an increase in NDIS participants staying in hospital, the Western NSW Local Health District chief executive, Mark Spittal, said at an inquiry today. NSW hospitals had 294 such people yet to be discharged in early October because no NDIS supports were in place or their assessments had not been finalised. Spittal told the federal inquiry examining the experience of rural NDIS participants in Dubbo that hospitals were the support providers of last resort for people with disabilities: That’s certainly not the place that somebody with a significant disability should be languishing. Their risk of acquiring infection, the risk of being marginalised because the acute care needs of somebody else in the ward will take predominance and, as a result, being unintentionally harmed are very, very high. An NDIS assessment can take several weeks involving a number of health practitioners at a time when GPs in major regional centres had closed their books, he said. If you’re a highly complex person with highly-complex disabilities needing access to primary care and you do not already have a (GP), your chances of being able to execute that are virtually zero. People living with disabilities in small towns were also having to move and leave their families behind to access specialised support, he said. Debris balls getting smaller, EPA says The size of the debris balls vary between a marble and tennis ball, Stephen Beaman from the Environment Protection Authority tells press: We are actually seeing, as we move away from the Coogee area, the size of the balls are getting smaller. Probably getting a lot of wave action in the surf zone, breaking that material up. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman’s name. NSW EPA analysing “quite unusual” tar ball debris The NSW Environment Protection Authority is currently analysing samples of the black ball-shaped debris. Stephen Beaman, EPA’s executive director of regulatory practice and services, confirms their tests results are matching up with those of Randwick city council’s. Speaking from Coogee, Beaman told press: We’ve had our specialists out collecting samples and having these samples analysed by our laboratories. We’re using this information to get further detail on what the nature of the material is, so we can use that to identify the … sources of contamination. Beaman told press the material “is quite unusual,” and that “it is quite a fibrous material”. He said it has a hydrocarbon base. He said it is too early to predict where it has come from, and clarified that oil can come from both boats and land sources. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman’s name and title. Thanks Emily and good afternoon everyone! Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I’ll hand over to Natasha May who will be with you for the next little while. Take care. Circling back to the Sydney beach debris Reverse and drift modelling will be used to consider the currents and wind in ascertaining where the black ball-shaped debris is coming from. David Wood from NSW Maritime has told reporters: We are also working with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to find where these contaminants may have come from. They will do reverse modelling and drift modelling, taking into account the currents and wind, for us to be able to work out whether it comes from south, north or east of NSW, to try and give better information on the likely source. Weather agencies warning of severe storms, unsettled weather The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, with severe thunderstorms possible throughout central and southern Australia today. The NSW SES has also shared an update, urging people in western parts of the state to prepare for unsettled weather in the coming few days. NSW Maritime says they can’t see any more tar balls drifting towards Sydney beaches NSW Maritime said they have seen no more sheen or balls drifting towards Sydney beaches, after black debris forced the closure of seven beaches. Speaking to reporters from Coogee, David Wood from NSW Maritime said: We’ve been working over the last two days with Port Authority of NSW. We’ve had vessels out on our water. We can ensure that we can’t see any more sheen on that water. We also can’t see any more balls that are drifting in towards the beaches of the city, which is a good sign at the moment. NSW Maritime coordinating response to debris on Sydney beaches Daren Wood, director of NSW Maritime, and Stephen Beaman, executive director of regulatory practice and services for the NSW EPA, have addressed press a short while ago on the thousands of small black balls that have washed up on beaches in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. Speaking from Coogee, Wood said NSW Maritime is taking coordination of the incident. They will be coordinating with Randwick City Council, EPA, the Port Authority and Australian Maritime Safety. This post has been updated to correct Stephen Beaman’s name and title. Cyber firm says it had to publicly ‘shame’ X into taking action on China-linked bot network Cybersecurity firm CyberCX has told the Australian parliament it was forced to brief the government and media about a China-linked bot network of 5,000 accounts on X because the company was unable to report it to X directly. The firm announced in August it had identified a network of at least 5,000 inauthentic X accounts almost certainly controlled by an AI large-language model-based system which the firm termed the Green Cicada Network. They assessed that the system was designed, at least in part, to ‘launder’ politically divisive narratives by rewording organic content as new posts and replies and to amplify organic divisive content on X through engagement. It was primarily focused on US politics and culture but had also amplified hot-button political issues in Australia, the UK and other countries. Speaking before a parliamentary inquiry on the Albanese government’s misinformation and disinformation bill, CyberCX’s executive director of corporate affairs, Jordan Newnham, said CyberCX it was difficult to report all 5,000 accounts to X, and CyberCX had been “banging our head against the wall” trying to contact X on it, so CyberCX reported the findings to government and then to media “basically just to shame X into taking action, which it looks like they have.” Newnham said X had suspended some of the accounts, but the so-called “puppet master” account for the bot network had appeared to delete its own account. He said CyberCX had still yet to hear from X on the matter. Hearing into government’s misinformation bill International bodies voicing concern about issues and developments in Australia could fall afoul of the government’s misinformation bill, the Human Rights Commission has claimed, saying the controversial legislation created “doubt” over public debates. A hearing into the bill, which is on its second run-through after being introduced then pulled and rewritten following strong public criticism, is being held today in Canberra. Lorraine Finlay, the Human Rights Commissioner, said the AHRC had concerns about how the bill would work. The Coalition has said it will oppose the government’s bill. The Liberal senator Dave Sharma asked Finlay about whether she thought a body like the United Nations or the OECD voicing concerns about economic conditions in Australia, or bleaching of the coral reef, could fall foul of the misinformation laws – insofar as such claims could cause harm to public confidence in financial markets or have consequences for the Australian community, which are stipulations in the legislation. “Potentially,” Findlay replied. She said there was “doubt” about how comments from such international bodies would be treated – “and that doubt is really at the heart of the concerns we have about this legislation, that there isn’t a precision in the definitions that allow for clarity about who is in and who is out.” The idea you’re even creating tiers of speech rights, is problematic from our perspective. Finlay said the AHRC had concerns about the bill creating “uncertainty” over how various institutions could participate in public debate. That uncertainty in our view, the real harm of it, it leads to the potential of over-censorship. Whether that’s by the platforms or indeed by individuals or organisations who might choose not to engage in speech that they otherwise would, because of a concern of whether they would be protected under the legislation or not. Finlay raised concern over the breadth of the definitions in the bill, and what she called “vagueness” of the definitions. Traffic banked up towards Sydney Harbour Bridge Here is a look at the traffic banked up at the Sydney Harbour Bridge. According to Tripview, a route 207 bus is stuck in the traffic. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is closed in both directions following a multi-vehicle, fatal collision this afternoon. Emergency services and Transport for NSW are attending the scene, and a helicopter. Heavy traffic conditions are being reported, with motorists told to expect significant delays, avoid the area and use an alternative route. Motorists can consider using the Sydney Harbour Tunnel in both directions. As we just reported, one person has died at the scene and a second is in a critical condition after the collision, which involved a bus that had no passengers on board at the time. Emergency services are responding to a multi-vehicle collision on Sydney Harbour Bridge. NSW Police said the incident involved three cars and a bus, around 1.40pm, and one person has died at the scene. A second is in a critical condition, police said, with paramedics assessing a number of other patients. The bus driver is uninjured, police said, and no passengers were on board at the time. Eight ambulance resources responded, including a helicopter. Emergency services are still on the scene responding. The NSW Environment Protection Authority has inspected three beaches riddled with black balls and has observed balls at a further eight, taking the total number of affected beaches to 11. EPA officers inspected Coogee Beach, Gordons Bay and Maroubra Beach this morning, all of which are fully or partially closed to the public. Balls were also observed at Bondi, Bronte, Clovelly and Tamarama, which were closed earlier today, as well as Congong, Frenchmans, Little Bay and Malabar. While Randwick council tests suggested the balls contained hydrocarbon, consistent with the makeup of tar balls, the EPA were yet to confirm the balls’ origins and potential risks to the community. In a statement, the agency advised against swimming or touching any balls that may have washed ashore until clean-ups were complete. The EPA encouraged the community to report further ball sitings to the NSW Environment Line on 131 555 or email info@epa.nsw.gov.au. Randwick mayor provides update on beach closures, cannot confirm if they will reopen by weekend The mayor of Randwick council, Dylan Parker, is providing an update on the beach closures, after tar balls washed ashore. As we flagged just earlier, seven beaches across Sydney have now closed as a result. Parker said council was liaising with NSW Maritime and the NSW government. There’ll be more from them later on to say … but our beaches will remain closed and we’re investigating other beaches along the Randwick local government area … We had clean-up crews working at Coogee Beach. [It] looks pretty good but we’re still waiting on the tides to come in in order to investigate. It remains under investigation as to what the source of the contaminant is but we’ll update the community as things come to light. He said the “approximately golf-sized black balls” have been washing up onto the shore at Coogee Beach “as recently as this morning”. We don’t currently know what the situation will be on the weekend, but we’re having ongoing conversations … We’d love to be open, but we’re not in a position to say that just yet. What we like to do is thank the community for their patience while we go through this situation. Shadow workplace relations minister on latest job figures The shadow workplace relations minister, Michaelia Cash, was speaking to reporters from Melbourne just earlier about the latest job figures. She said the 4.1% unemployment rate was “welcomed by the Coalition” but argued “when you look behind the figures, we are now seeing what are incredibly concerning trends.” She said the growth was occurring in the public sector, not the private sector, and that the hours worked was also increased in the public sector but not the private. The public sector jobs growth is now outpacing the private sector and that is because the Albanese government [is] great at creating public sector jobs, but not so good [at] motivating the private sector to create jobs. Nine to hold all staff meeting at 4pm to outline culture review findings All staff from Nine Entertainment’s television and newspaper divisions have been invited to an online briefing at 4pm today at which management will outline the findings of an independent cultural review. It was commissioned after allegations of inappropriate behaviour and broader cultural issues in the television newsrooms were uncovered earlier this year. The majority of the problems have occurred within the Channel Nine newsrooms and not the newsrooms of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. Acting chief executive officer Matt Stanton told staff the review by Intersection may be a challenging time for employees and confidential support is available. After staff have been briefed the findings will be made public. Stanton replaced Nine’s former chief executive Mike Sneesby who commissioned the review in May. Former television news boss Darren Wick left the business earlier this year after allegations of inappropriate conduct. The Riotact journalist to whom the ACT opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, gave the middle finger has responded. Journalist Ian Bushnell said he is frustrated at being made the centre of a viral news story, in a post published to Riotact. I was just doing my job. It’s very awkward for a journalist to be at the centre of the story rather than just reporting on it. Bushnell is a former news editor of the Canberra Times and said attacks on journalists were now more common than they were earlier in his career. Trying to attack journalists for just doing their job is something the public should be extremely concerned about. It undermines the democratic process. He also rejected any suggestion of being unprofessional, and said as a journalist he was “there to ask questions on behalf of the public”. Ms Lee is the only politician I’ve had these sorts of exchanges with. I’m on good terms with everyone else, and I thought I was on good terms with her. Murray Watt says jobs figures ‘remarkable achievement’ The employment and workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, was speaking in Melbourne earlier about today’s job figures. He welcomed news that gains had lifted the number of extra jobs since the Albanese government took office to more than 1 million, and told reporters: This is the most jobs ever created in a single parliamentary term by any Australian government ever. It’s the first time in Australian history that any government has created more than 1 million new jobs in a single parliamentary term … This is a remarkable achievement in the context of a slowing economy and a labour market that’s expected to soften. NSW premier on closed Sydney beaches The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said eastern beaches had been closed “out of an abundance of caution” after tar balls washed ashore this week. He said the public would be kept updated on the investigations being led by the NSW Environment Protection Authority. He said: We need to make sure that we’re fully investigating. It’s an unusual occurrence on Sydney’s beaches. The EPA is leading those investigations. The council is responsible for closing down the beaches. Three more Sydney beaches have been closed “out of precaution”, after mysterious tar balls have washed ashore. Waverly Council said all of its beached were closed to the public today, after it was informed that “pea to marble size balls” were observed by EPA staff on Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches. All beaches in the Waverly LGA would now be closed as a precaution, the council said, until further investigation has been carried out. Mayor Will Nemesh said council would prioritise the safety of the community, and continue to monitor the situation closely: The wellbeing of our community is paramount. That’s why council has taken the precaution to close our beaches. The list of closed Sydney beaches now includes: Clovelly Beach The northern end of Maroubra Beach Coogee Beach Gordons Bay Bondi Beach Tamarama Beach Bronte Beach Aussie shares rally to second all-time high of the week The local share market has set its second all-time high for the week and is on track for its best daily performance in five weeks, AAP reports. At noon Aedt the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 81.4 points, or 0.98%, to 8,366.1, while the broader All Ordinaries had gained 80 points, or 0.93%, to 8,636.6. The ASX200 had been up by as much as 1.2% in late morning trading, but trimmed its gains after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported better-than-expected jobs data for September, with another 64,000 created. Ten of the ASX’s 11 sectors were higher at midday, all except technology. The property sector was the biggest gainer, up 1.4% as Goodman Group advanced 2% and Charter Hall climbed 2.7%. Westpac and NAB were leading the big four banks at midday, both up 1.2%. CBA had added 0.5% and ANZ was 0.7% higher. It was a bit of a more muted day for the heavyweight mining sector. BHP was up 0.2% and Rio Tinto and Fortescue had both climbed 0.3%. The Australian dollar was buying 67.07 US cents, from 66.96 US cents at yesterday’s ASX close. How a ‘putrid’ find in a museum cupboard could be the key to bringing the Tasmanian tiger back to life Breakthroughs sometimes turn up in unexpected places. The researchers working on the international push to bring back the thylacine say theirs turned up in a long-ignored bucket in the back of a cupboard at a Melbourne museum. It contained an astonishingly well-preserved head of the extinct marsupial, also known as the Tasmanian tiger – containing material the scientists thought would be impossible to find. The project to bring back the thylacine is being driven by Colossal, a Texas-based biotechnology “de-extinction and species preservation” company that is also aiming to recreate the woolly mammoth and the dodo using genetic engineering techniques. You can read more details about this project, below: Chalmers cheers 1m jobs during Albanese government As we flagged, the Albanese needed about an extra 23,000 jobs from the September data to pass the 1m mark since they took office in May 2022. The 64,100 that were added handily cleared that bar (subject to revisions). Chalmers has chimed in and said: This is the first and only time any government of any political persuasion has overseen the creation of a million new jobs in a single parliamentary term. We welcome the fact that the majority of these million new jobs are full time and around half are for women. For what it’s worth, the comparison look like this (as of last August), so Chalmers’ office put out a month ago: Still, the good news has an aftertaste: the RBA is looking for the jobs market to cool a bit to take out what it sees as excessive demand in the economy before it gets out its interest rate axe. Anyway, you can follow on at home here as well: Map of the Sydney beach closures after tar balls washed ashore Circling back to news that two more Sydney beaches had closed, after tar balls washed ashore. The beaches that are currently closed are: Clovelly Beach The northern end of Maroubra Beach Coogee beach Gordons Bay As Rafqa Touma reported just earlier, the four beaches will be closed until further notice. Greens call on government to fund national anti-racism strategy Senator Mehreen Faruqi, the deputy Greens leader and spokesperson for anti-racism, has called on the government to fund a national anti-racism strategy. This follows the release of a report commissioned by the AHRC, with first-hand accounts revealing racism in Australia was “ubiquitous, insidious and profoundly damaging”. (You can read more earlier in the blog here). In a statement, Faruqi said the report shows “racism is entrenched in Australia, and that it is rooted in settler colonialism and whiteness as an ideology and practice.” Racism is rife across society - in government, in the media, in interactions with the police, in workplaces, in playgrounds. For how long will First Nations people and people of colour in this country be subjected to racism before it is acknowledged and systemically tackled by the government? Instead of using ‘social cohesion’ as a distraction and a way of cracking down on legitimate protests against Israel’s genocide in Gaza, Labor must fully fund the AHRC to urgently implement a national anti-racism strategy. The Labor government can start today by mandating anti-racism training for all parliamentarians, to challenge white privilege which is at the core of racism in this country. Two charged after investigation into suspicious fire on northern beaches Two people have been charged after an investigation into an alleged suspicious fire on Sydney’s northern beaches last year, New South Wales Police said. On Monday, police arrested a 21-year-old man in Wauchope in connection to a truck fire in Cromer in April 2023. NSW Fire and Rescue crews extinguished the blaze, but the truck was destroyed. Police established a crime scene and began investigating the incident. In a statement, police said the man was taken to Port Macquarie police station, where he was charged with damage to property by fire/explosive over $15,000. He was granted conditional bail to appear before local in November. A 38-year-old woman was arrested in Cromer yesterday. She was taken to Manly police station, where she was charged with dishonestly destroying or damaging property with a view to making a gain from it. She was refused bail to appear before Manly local court today. Clovelly Beach and the northern end of Maroubra Beach have been closed after tar balls washed ashore overnight. Coogee beach was closed on Tuesday, and Gordons Bay beach was closed on Wednesday, with beachgoers warned not to touch or go near the debris, which preliminary testing shows as a hydrocarbon-based pollutant, but we still don’t know where the balls are coming from. The four beaches will be closed until further notice. Randwick Mayor Dylan Parker said Council would continue to remove the material across all beaches throughout the day: We don’t yet know what has happened to produce the debris washing up on our beaches, but we will continue to work with relevant authorities to ensure the safety of the public and clean up our beaches. Banking outages taking longer to fix, RBA report says Australian consumers and businesses are suffering longer outages for digital payment services, the research from the Reserve Bank of Australia has revealed. As AAP reports, this comes one day after a string of outages hit Westpac and subsidiaries including St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA, leaving customers unable to access their accounts online. The research, published today, was based on incident reports issued to the RBA from payment providers dating back to 2012, and more detailed statistics starting in 2021. The data detailed significant financial outages lasting longer than 30 minutes. Researchers Jared Griffiths and Matthew Joyce found the number of financial outages in Australia had dropped over the period, but the duration of financial outages had not fallen, with the median length of incidents involving fast money transfers and ATMs lasting more than two hours – and next-day transfer outages taking almost eight hours to resolve. The report noted that “every incident or outage can potentially cause inconvenience or economic harm for end-users of those systems.” Given the wide-reaching impact of outages, the effective management of operational risk in the payments system has never been more important. Consumers’ reliance on contactless payments and digital banking had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, RMIT finance senior lecturer Dr My Nguyen said, giving any outage a stronger impact. But Nguyen said in terms of global trends, “Australia is doing fairly well for reliability.” Any way you slice it, Australia’s labour market has been going gangbusters for most of this year and September turned out to be no exception (despite the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, bracing everyone for a downward arrow). Every state bar South Australia posted a lower jobless rate (seasonally adjusted) compared with August. Among the big economies, Western Australia led the way at 3.6%, down from 3.9%, with New South Wales also back into the “3s” at 3.7% from 4.1%. Queensland, which goes to the polls in a bit over a week, didn’t do too badly either, at 4.1%, easing from 4.2%, and Victoria’s eased by a similar margin to 4.4%. The lowest jobless rate in the land award went to the ACT (which handily goes to the polls this weekend). It fell to 3.4% from 3.8% (cue moaning in some media about government staff levels bulking up). South Australia’s increase to 4.3% from 3.9% in August was the only laggard. As the ABS notes, employment over the past year has risen at 3.1% versus population’s 2.5% growth rate. A generally downbeat NAB survey out at the same time as the jobs figures showed finding staff remains a challenge: Expectations for employment in three and 12 months edged down slightly, but the share of firms reporting availability of labour as a constraint edged back up to 82% (from 79%). In such conditions, shy of a sharply lower inflation result for the September quarter (out from the ABS on 30 October), the RBA looks unlikely to lower its cash rate soon. Perhaps a jump in inflation (though not very likely) might put another rate rise back on the agenda? The LNP candidate for Gregory in the upcoming Queensland election, Sean Dillon, has told 4BC radio he was assaulted and threatened near his home by two people. He alleged he was told “shut your union bashing mouth” by two people, and thrown on the bonnet of his car. Dillon told the station the incident was “terrifying” and “pretty horrific”, occurring 20km from his house after he pulled over to assist someone. I was physically accosted at that point, and it was pretty explicit … the instructions about what they thought around my continued involvement in politics and what I should or shouldn’t do. Dillon said he was in shock afterwards, because “it was the last thing that you expect as a political candidate”. He said the alleged offenders did not have their faces covered, but were not known to him. Dillon said he has good relationships with various union members, and “there’s certainly no union bashing when it comes to me”. Queensland police confirmed it received a complaint in relation to an alleged assault on 27 August, around 6.30pm, at the intersection of Eulimbie Road and Clermont Alpha Road in Alpha. Police said investigations are continuing. Stocks pared gains before release of jobs figures Underscoring the strength of the jobs figures and the reduced chance of an early RBA interest rate cut, the Australian dollar jumped about 0.2 of a US cent to US66.9c and stocks pared their gains for the day to 0.85% from 1.15% just before the release of the jobs figures. Job additions should lift total since Albanese took office to more than 1 million Economists had also expected the economy to add a net 25,000 jobs. Instead, more than 51,000 full-time positions alone were added with more than 12,000 part-time roles added as well. Unless there are revisions to previous months’ tallies, the September job additions should lift the total since the Albanese government took office to more than 1 million new jobs. More on the latest job figures The jobless rate for September was 4.1%, lower than the 4.2% rate expected by economists. The ABS also revised lower the August unemployment rate to 4.1%, meaning the month to month rate was unchanged. Australia’s employers added more than 64,000 jobs last month, most of them full-time, making it less likely the Reserve Bank will cut its key interest rate this side of Christmas. More to come. Victorian police are investigating after a three-year-old child was hit by a car in Melbourne earlier this morning. Police believe a vehicle struck the child at the intersection of James Cook Drive and Heatherton Road, in Endeavour Hills, about 8.30am. The three-year-old was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. The driver, a 24-year-old Endeavour Hills man, stopped at the scene and is speaking with police. The exact circumstances surrounding the collision are yet to be established, police said, and the investigation remains ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. The suspension of The Star Sydney’s licence has been prolonged and millions more handed down in fines, AAP reports, after a second probe into the casino revealed further, significant failings. The casino operator was advised this morning that it was being hit with a $15m fine for the breaches, the NSW Independent Casino Commission announced. Star Entertainment Group had started to clean up its act but huge questions remain around competence and capability, chief commissioner Philip Crawford said. Another extension of its existing Sydney licence suspension and independent manager’s appointment is aimed at protecting employment at the business. Crawford said: We’ve had in our minds for quite some time that the public interest is served around the jobs. If Sydney Star fails, the Star group will fail, and that’s a group that employs 9000-plus people ... it would affect the lives of a lot of people. There’s no coming back if you take the licence away. An independent review into governance and management at the casino must be completed by the end of the financial year. Senior management will be “refreshed” in a bid to reset the leadership group, while conditions around the casino’s licence have been amended. National Gambling Helpline: 1800 858 858 ACT chief minister, deputy prime minister, weigh in on middle finger debacle The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has responded to reports that the opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, gave a journalist the middle finger yesterday afternoon, ahead of Saturday’s territory election. As AAP reports, Barr has told reporters: Over the course of a campaign you learn a lot about how individuals respond to immense pressure. I can understand that frustration but equally that’s part of the role in government. Every week, you have to make difficult decisions, give press conferences where you are likely to get questions that are uncomfortable, where occasionally if the journalist doesn’t feel you’re answering the question, they may have a follow-up question, or two or three or four. For more on this, including reactions from Richard Marles and Matt Canavan, have a read below: How has a fugitive father hidden his three children for so long? You may have seen reports earlier this month that New Zealand fugitive Tom Phillips and his three children were spotted together for the first time in nearly three years. Just before Christmas 2021, he fled into the wilderness with his children, Ember, now 8, Maverick, now 9, and Jayda, now 11, after a dispute with their mother. The group was spotted earlier in the month on Marokopa farmland, in New Zealand’s Waikato region, after a chance encounter with teenage pig hunters. As Michelle Duff reports, the country is desperate to know where he is and why – after three winters spent hiding in rugged backcountry with his children – he hasn’t been caught. You can read more on this below: Victorian opposition slams greyhound motion from Animal Justice Party MP The Victorian opposition spokesperson for racing, Tim Bull, has had a crack at Labor for supporting a motion by Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell to introduce further transparency measures for greyhound racing dog deaths. The motion, which passed parliament’s upper house yesterday, will force Greyhound Racing Victoria (GRV) to report how many dogs are killed off track and the reasons for their deaths, as well a breakdown of all rehoming, including dogs sent overseas and interstate. But Bull said the new measures were “unachievable and costly”. He said in a statement: You cannot allow the Animal Justice party, with one MP out of 128, to dictate greyhound governance from the parliament chamber. It is a ridiculous notion. I am stunned the minister would side with an MP who publicly states she wishes to end greyhound racing. He is running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds. GRV already has in place a microchipping program that tracks the location, custody and medical history of Victorian greyhounds throughout their lives, however it has no power to command members of the general public to report a second change of ownership of a pet greyhound. This is not the job of GRV and falls within council pet registration. Apart from being impossible to implement, as GRV simply does not have these powers, it is a process that would come at cost in a period when declining betting turnover is impacting all codes. For more on Purcell’s motion, you can have a read below: Here’s a look at the national forecasts across Australia’s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Workplace hearing damage affecting one in 10 Aussies Hearing loss from a workplace incident has affected one in 10 Australians despite most saying ear protection is not necessary, a report has revealed. As AAP reports, Hearing Australia data released today surveyed more than 1,000 people on their experience with, and avoiding, hearing damage. A quarter of respondents said they knew someone who has experienced workplace noise-related damage. Eleven per cent experienced damage from workplace noise themselves, but one in three gave little thought to protecting themselves. Hearing Australia’s principal audiologist Karen Hirschausen said: Many people don’t fully understand the risk to their hearing in a nightclub or concert, and they overestimate the length of time they can spend in these noisy environments without hearing protection before risking hearing damage. When people are in loud environments like this, they [need to] take steps to protect their hearing, such as having regular breaks and moving away from speakers. Hirschausen believes workplace laws that stipulate noise-exposed workers should have their hearing tested when they start work, and then at two-yearly intervals, should be reinforced. People with asthma urged to stay vigilant as thunderstorm asthma season begins next month People with hay fever are urged to stay alert this thunderstorm asthma season which starts in November and mainly affects south-east Australia. According to Prof Jo Douglass from Asthma Australia, many thunderstorm asthma sufferers believe they only suffer from hay fever. In 2016, only a third of the 3,500 who presented at Victorian hospitals with thunderstorm asthma had previously suffered from asthma. Almost nine in 10 had previously had hay fever. She said it was important for hay fever sufferers to recognise symptoms associated with asthma, such as night waking and morning wheezing. Those suffering from asthma and hay fever are encouraged to check pollen levels, ensure their asthma action plan is up to date, use a preventer inhaler and keep hay fever under control. Bureau of Meteorology testing tropical cyclone warning system The Bureau of Meteorology says it will be testing its tropical cyclone warning system today. The routine testing will occur from 10am to 5pm Aedt, marked “TEST” and appearing on the Bureau’s website and weather app. University of Melbourne’s chancellor backs condemnation of actions of some pro-Palestine protesters The University of Melbourne’s chancellor has expressed “full support” for the vice-chancellor’s condemnation of the actions of some pro-Palestine protesters during a sit-in last week. Last Wednesday, a group of students, staff and alumni occupied the office of a Jewish staff member in a bid for the university to cut their ties with universities in Israel, some masked and wearing Palestinian keffiyehs. Jane Hansen confirmed the university council met on campus on Wednesday as part of its usual cycle of meetings. She said there were no specific items or resolutions about these matters, however council expressed its full support for previous statements made by the vice-chancellor and senior staff in relation to the protest. Around two dozen protesters gathered at the same time on campus, alleging more actions were coming and sit ins were “not violent”. Hanson said: Intentional acts of antisemitism, intimidation, violence or vilification against members of our community are completely unacceptable, as is any threat to the principles of academic freedom. On Tuesday, deputy vice-chancellors Prof Mark Cassidy and Prof Michael Wesley wrote to staff reiterating international research was “fundamental” to the university and staff and students “must be free to undertake their work without fear or intimidation”. McBride to have appeal heard next March in bid to have jail sentence thrown out or reduced The former army lawyer David McBride will have his appeal heard next March in a bid to throw out, or reduce, his jail sentence. McBride is serving time in Canberra’s Alexander Maconochie Centre after he was sentenced to five years and eight months for pleading guilty to three charges in November 2023 of stealing commonwealth information and passing that to journalists at the ABC. The material was used as the basis for a 2017 investigative series exposing alleged war crimes by Australian defence force personnel in Afghanistan, titled the Afghan Files. McBride was given a non-parole period of 27 months and will remain in jail until at least August 2026 if his appeal is unsuccessful. His appeal will be heard on 3 March 2025 in the ACT supreme court and is expected to last for a day. McBride’s legal team is seeking to appeal against the convictions and the severity of the sentence on the basis McBride believed it was his duty to release the information in the public interest. McBride’s lawyer, Eddie Lloyd, told Guardian Australia earlier this month McBride will argue he took an oath to serve the country and uphold the rule of law and, for that reason, felt he had “a duty to the public” to “blow the whistle”. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has suggested she will be making a significant announcement on housing soon. Speaking outside parliament this morning, Allan said the lack of affordable housing could be to blame for the nation’s falling birth rate: There are many reasons why women, why families choose to have kids and to have a certain number of kids, and these are really personal decisions. Yes, they are influenced by economic circumstances, whether you can get into a home, whether you can get into a home that’s close to your family supports. This is why building more homes is so important and building them in exactly the locations that Victorians are looking. She said Victorians want to live “close to where they grew up” but are priced out: Many want to live close to mum and dad or their family networks, so that when they have kids they’ve got that support network around them. Because I can tell you, it takes a village to raise a child. I’m blessed to have my family support me and as we are raising our kids, and that is true for so many Victorians. If you live an hour more away from your family support, that makes it harder and harder, and that’s why building more homes, particularly in and around the suburbs of Melbourne, is so vitally important … That is why, very soon, I’ll be having a lot more to say about how we are going to do a lot more to build more homes in and around the suburbs of Melbourne. Sticking with the declining birthrate for a moment, and AAP reports a revival of the baby bonus is not being considered by the government. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, told Sunrise the federal government was not considering reintroducing the baby bonus to boost the fertility rate: It’s not something that we’ve been discussing. I’m interested, obviously, in the figures. We want to do what we can to make it easier for families and couples to have children and we are doing that. It is important that we have a sustainable birthrate. The baby bonus was set up by the Howard government and gave $3,000 lump sum payments to new parents of children born from July 2004. The then treasurer, Peter Costello, urged families to “have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country”. Marles said the government was focused on cost-of-living measures for families. Demographer says birthrate below 1.5 would be hard to come back from Demographer Liz Allen from the Australian National University says the declining birthrate figures, released by the ABS yesterday, are “historic”. As we reported in yesterday’s blog, in 2023 there were 286,998 births registered in Australia, with a total fertility rate of 1.50 babies per woman. The total fertility rate has slowly dropped from 1.86 in 1993. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast earlier, Allen said the figures were “breathtaking”. It feels like we have hit rock bottom. I mean, these are historic figures, particularly the total fertility rate. What is most concerning to me as a demographer is once we break this 1.5 births per woman threshold, if we go any lower, we’re going to have really great difficulty bringing it back, as other countries around the world have shown. Allen said that this decline is not “necessarily [happening] by choice”, and that young people are “unlikely to achieve their desired family size.” We’re not talking oodles of children here, we’re talking one or two. The hurdles and barriers to have a much-wanted family are just insurmountable now. We have housing unaffordability, we have job insecurity and economic insecurity more broadly. We’ve got gender inequality and climate change that are really at the front of mind for our young people. Just to some breaking international news this last hour, former One Direction member Liam Payne has died aged 31 after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires. You can read more on this below, with more details to follow: One million jobs created during Albanese government? We’ll know soon Later this morning we’ll get September labour force figures from the ABS, and it’s possible we’ll nudge past the 1-million-extra-jobs mark since the Albanese government came to office in May 2022. Economists’ consensus is the Australian economy added 25,000 jobs last month, enough to keep the unemployment rate at 4.2%. Last month, there was a net increase of 47,500 jobs, although all were part-time roles, with 3,100 full-time jobs lost (prior to ABS revisions). Numbers do get tweaked, but, as of last month, the government could point to 977,700 jobs created since it took office (including about 52,800 in May 2022 itself when they took office three weeks in, if we want to quibble). Before today’s release, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was dampening expectations of a good set of numbers for September: Our labour market is not immune from the weakness in the economy and is softening around the edges. We’ve seen that in a host of data points, including the rise in the unemployment rate and lower average hours in recent months. Some of those data points come from Treasury itself, so perhaps Chalmers is opening some “early mail”. As always, though, changes to the participation rate (which has been hovering at record highs at 67.1%) could push the unemployment rate up or down. That’s why we tend to focus on the jobs added or lost (and the hours worked) as better guides to what’s going on in the economy. Anyway, watch out for the numbers at 11.30am AEDT. More on Green group estimate of Queensland LNP coal plan Continuing from our last post: Callide unit C, which is 13 years younger than unit B, blew up in 2021, knocking out power to 375,000 homes and businesses. All four Callide units went offline in 2022 due to multiple equipment failures at all of the plants. Energy strategist Clare Silcock said: Coal-fired power stations are increasingly a liability as they age and more renewable energy comes online. The troubled Callide C is a stark example of this, where we’ve seen multiple catastrophic failures, and the private company that owns half of the power plant has gone into administration because they can’t front the costs of keeping coal-fired power stations open. Neighbouring Callide B is also experiencing reliability issues. Over the past three years it’s only been able to operate at 70% capacity due to numerous unit breakdowns, often during summer at times of peak demand. Silcock said the government should simply close the plant as scheduled and spend the money on renewable energy instead. Green group estimates LNP’s keep coal plan would cost $420m a year A Liberal National party pledge to keep a Queensland coal station open beyond its scheduled closure would cost up to $420m a year, according to the Queensland Conservation Council. Callide unit B was built in 1988 and is due to close in 2028. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has pledged to keep coal power “indefinitely”, specifically promising to keep Callide B running longer. Crisafulli said last week the notion you can “turn off Queensland’s baseload power without impacting reliability or people’s hip pocket” by the early 2030s was “fanciful.” The plant made an annual loss of about $60m a year over the past five years, QCC says. Unit B is 100% publicly owned, which means the taxpayer foots the bill. Energy strategist Clare Silcock said the cost would dramatically increase past 2028: The LNP’s comments about keeping Callide B open beyond the end of its life are playing dangerous politics with our energy system. Callide B was designed with a lifespan of 40 years. Keeping it open beyond then could cost Queenslanders up to $420m in 2029 and expose us to higher risks of outages and pollution. More to come in a moment. ‘More than hurtful words’: Australia’s systemic racism Systemic experiences of racial discrimination at health services, schools, workplaces and when interacting with police have led the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to double down on calls for a National Anti-Racism Framework. As AAP reports, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia (FECCA) consulted with 860 participants for a report, commissioned by the AHRC. Respondents reported feeling that their cultural background affected the quality of health care they received from professionals, while others said they felt unsafe at school due to teachers discriminating. Racism was prevalent regardless of age, sexuality, faith, disability or cultural background, the commission found. Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said the first-hand accounts revealed racism in Australia was “ubiquitous, insidious and profoundly damaging”. The racism described is more than hurtful words being said to someone … it is systemic, often involving dealings with some level of authority, whose power determines access to opportunities, basic needs, services, or justice. Racism seeps into almost every aspect of people’s lives, and in ways that have become so normalised that victims don’t feel they can talk about it … everyday racism is hidden in plain sight. The report’s 11 recommendations included the government committing to a whole-of-society anti-racism agenda, with public and private institutions urged to have discrimination policies in place including preventative and redress mechanisms. Overhaul of compensation system for serious crime victims in Victoria announced Victims of serious crime in Victoria will be able to access an additional $25,000 in financial assistance, as part of a major overhaul of the state’s compensation system. The minister for victim support, Enver Erdogan, this morning has announced the victims of crime assistance tribunal, known as Vocat, will be abolished and replaced with a new online financial assistance scheme. Under the new scheme, which comes into effect on 18 November, primary victims of crime will be able to access $60,000 for loss of income, medical, counselling and safety-related expenses, as well as an additional $25,000 in certain circumstances. Secondary victims – someone who is injured at the scene or witnesses the crime – and family members of victims will continue to be able to access up to $50,000. The new scheme also removes the harmful practice of pooling $100,000 of financial assistance for families, with compensation awarded to each individual family member. Previous strict definitions around who was considered family have also been scrapped, meaning Aboriginal kinship relations, LGBTQ+ relationships and other family members such as in-laws can apply. Victims will no longer have to go into court to complete the process and are able to choose to receive a recognition statement from the state acknowledging the effects of the crime and expressing condolences. Erdogan said: Going through the court system can be quite traumatic. Vocat operates out of the magistrates court and that can be quite confrontational to be frank, because you might need attend and face your perpetrator. And we’ve heard from victims, especially of domestic violence and sexual violence, how difficult that can be, the anxiety. There’s people that usually have suffered quite considerable physical, mental injuries as a result of the crime, and obviously going to an online-based system is just a lot easier and more straightforward, and that’s the reason why we proceeded down this path, in consultation with victims. Opposition supports donation of tanks to Ukraine The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, says he “strongly supports” a move from the government to donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. In a post to X, he wrote: Strongly support the decision to gift 49 M1A1 tanks being retired by the Australian Army to Ukraine. It was crucial to not repeat the mistakes of the Taipan helicopters, which were buried by the Albanese government rather than gifted. The tanks should be delivered asap. Early this year, Australia refused Ukraine’s request to donate its retired fleet of Taipan helicopters – stating they couldn’t be returned in a flying condition. The fleet was dismantled and buried. Marles’ denies bullying problem in his office Circling back to Richard Marles’ interview on the Today show, where he was asked whether his office has a bullying problem. This comes after Marles’ chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, alleges her boss effectively sacked her without warning in a phone call on 30 April, the day after they returned from a challenging but successful visit to Ukraine, for which she says he had credited her. Marles said “no”, his office doesn’t have a bullying problem, and pointed to his statement in parliament last week. Obviously I feel very sad that this situation has got to the point that it has. And as I said last week, you know, Jo Tarnawsky is somebody who I’ve known a long time, who worked with me right back in 2012, and I’m very grateful for the service that she’s provided to me, then and now. You know, this matter is now in the hands of lawyers, which is obviously Jo’s right. And it’s very difficult for me as a result to comment much on it further. An independent review, commissioned by Nine Entertainment after it acknowledged “alleged inappropriate behaviour and broader cultural issues” in its television newsrooms, will be released today. The report will examine inappropriate behaviour and a “concentration of power” at the organisation that has “damaged the trust and fairness within our television newsrooms”. Nine’s former chief executive Mike Sneesby commissioned the review in May after media reports about how management handled allegations of inappropriate behaviour by former television news boss Darren Wick. News Corp and Nine newspaper reports alleged inappropriate touching of female staff at Nine Entertainment functions, including Christmas parties and the Logies television awards. Wick left the company in March and Sneesby followed in September. South Australia’s shadow minister for women on abortion legislation that was rejected overnight Yesterday, South Australia’s upper house held a conscience vote on legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days – an extremely rare occurrence – to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. The bill was narrowly defeated with 10 votes opposed to 9 in favour, as Tory Shepherd reports: The state’s shadow minister for women, Michelle Lensink, is a vocal opponent of the bill and had to dash to parliament to vote. She was on leave having chemotherapy, and had believed she had a ‘pair’ who would sit out the vote so as to not affect the result. At the last minute MLC Dennis Hood stepped in to pair her. Speaking to ABC RN this morning about what happened, she said: It was quite bizarre, and I think it just shows how desperate … some people can be in this debate … it’s just a terrible piece of legislation. As for how close the vote ended up being, Lensink said: “that’s sort of margin that we have on conscience votes in the Legislative Council at the moment”. Asked about what alliances occurred within the parliament around this, she said: There’s a lot of, particularly women, who work together, who understand that these are not simple choices that other women make when they go through them, that they’re very challenging … We know people’s circumstances who’ve been through this. So, you know, we work to try and make sure that that is respected and that the parliament understands that these are decisions that people have to make with the advice of their doctors and midwives, and they shouldn’t have the parliament sort of sticking its nose in randomly at the most stressful point properly in their entire lives. Marles again asked about PM’s property purchase Richard Marles was up on the Today show earlier, and was asked about the prime minister’s $4.3m property purchase – which has made headlines this week amid the cost of living crisis. Marles defended the move and said Anthony Albanese is “entitled to his own personal affairs and his own private life, and obviously the property that he and his partner purchased sit in that domain”. I don’t think Australians are going to be particularly interested in that. I think what Australians are interested in is what the prime minister does when he comes to work. In the final days leading up to the ACT election this Saturday, the opposition leader, Elizabeth Lee, has made headlines for giving a journalist the middle finger. Lee, who is the leader of the Canberra Liberals, had a tense exchange with a reporter during a press conference yesterday, telling them: “I will answer the question in my own way Ian [Bushnell], you don’t get to dictate how I answer the question.” She is then seen walking away, before suddenly turning back to the camera and “flipping the bird”. ABC reported the full exchange – regarding the costs of her party’s policies – as follows: Bushnell: “I just want you to answer the question.” Lee: “Are you finished?” Bushnell: “I am, answer the question.” Lee: “Are you finished or not? I will answer the question in my own way Ian. You don’t get to dictate how I answer the question.” Bushnell: “OK.” As the ABC reports, Lee apologised later that afternoon and said she had a “history with this journalist”, who is from RiotACT. Earlier, I engaged in poor behaviour that was unprofessional, and I apologise … I respect the work that journalists do, including asking the tough questions, and I think that I have demonstrated during this term that I’m willing to step up and answer tough questions. I don’t excuse my behaviour. It was poor behaviour and I am disappointed in myself and, in a moment of frustration, I did let the emotional side of my reaction get the better of me. Thunderstorm risk over most of South Australia today Miriam Bradbury said there was widespread risks of thunderstorms through much of southern and south-eastern Australia today: The severe storm risk today covers pretty much the entire state of South Australia, including the Adelaide area. But it also catches states on this border area of South Australia too. She said severe thunderstorms may occur across southern inland Western Australia, inland New South Wales and parts of Victoria, bringing damaging winds, large hail and heavy falls, “or a combination of all three”. Super cell thunderstorm over Casterton in Victoria, with tennis ball-size hail Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology was speaking with ABC News Breakfast earlier, about the thunderstorms that have lashed the south-east coast in recent days. She said storms throughout multiple states intensified through the afternoon and evening yesterday, with “very significant storms” in western Victoria. She pointed to the town of Casterton in the Horsham area, which experienced a super cell thunderstorm. That did bring some incredibly heavy downpours. We had 22mm in 20 minutes at Casterton, which is a lot of rainfall to happen in a very short space of time, as well as very large hail, pushing up towards tennis ball size and some very strong and gusty winds. She said super cell storms are “sort of one step up from severe thunderstorms, which are a couple of steps up from everyday thunderstorms in the first place”. Severe Weather Australia has shared some images of the giant hail and thunderstorm damage across Casterton here. Richard Marles questioned on declining birthrate data Richard Marles was also asked about new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing a declining birthrate. As we reported in yesterday’s blog, in 2023 there were 286,998 births registered in Australia, with a total fertility rate of 1.50 babies per woman. The total fertility rate has slowly dropped from 1.86 in 1993. The decline is most prominent among women aged 15 to 19, the ABS said, while the age-specific fertility rate of women aged 40 to 44 years has almost doubled in 30 years. Responding to the figures, Marles said this is why “we are focused on the sorts of costs of living pressures that impact families, so that we can do what we can to make it more affordable for people to raise a family”. We know people are doing it tough, and are not for a moment are we saying that the job is done here … We understand that we want people to be able to meet their dreams and aspirations in terms of having a family. Our reporter Tory Shepherd has taken a look at plummeting birthrates worldwide, which you can read more on below in these two pieces: Richard Marles on donation of tanks to Ukraine The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and also spoke to the donation of 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. He said: We know this will be a conflict that goes for a long time. We are in there for the long haul. This will not be the last package that we provide to Ukraine, as we have consistently said. And we’ll stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to resolve its conflicts on its own terms. Asked about concerns that Donald Trump may reduce support for Ukraine if elected as US president, Marles said “there’s a lot at stake”. We cannot allow to stand the idea that a large country can invade a smaller nation, not by reference to international law but reference to power and might. We stand with the international community in terms of supporting Ukraine, and we’ll continue to do that. And obviously, what plays out in America is a matter for the American people. But it really matters that the global community continue to support Ukraine in its fight. Conroy provides more detail on donation of 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, has been speaking with ABC RN after the announcement Australia would donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. You can read more about this earlier in the blog from Daniel Hurst, here. Asked what changed, after the Albanese government initially indicated a donation wouldn’t occur, Conroy said: We were talking with the Ukrainian government about their priorities and they made clear this is one of their priorities … Another important factor was the delivery of our new M1A2 tanks beginning in the middle of this year that free up these tanks to be released to Ukraine. So this is part of a broader process, and there are other checks and balances – including support from the United States – for the transfer of this equipment. Conroy couldn’t disclose when the tanks would be delivered due to “operational security”. Asked if the tanks were safe for use, he said Australia was talking with Ukraine about whether “some of these tanks will require some modifications to be fixed for battlefield”. We’ve made it very clear that we’re unwavering in our support for the people of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unprovoked and illegal war, and we’ve made it very clear that we’ll be supporting Ukraine as long as it takes for them to end the war on their terms and to maintain pressure on Russia. People held on Nauru moved into community, struggling with everyday costs Caseworkers with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre say the “majority” of people held in closed detention on Nauru have recently been moved into the community – however are struggling with the cost of everyday essentials. According to a statement from the ASRC, those in the community are allocated $230 per fortnight to survive on. About 39 people are living in “a complex similar to a detention centre and must share one small, office-sized kitchen”, the centre said, while transportation is posing a barrier for those in more remote areas. The ASRC is calling on the government to urgently evacuate all people held on Nauru for medical care and support while they wait for protection claims to be processed. Its deputy chief executive, Jana Favero, said: People should never have been sent to Nauru in the first place … The harm of offshore detention is well documented and will continue until we stop outsourcing our moral responsibility and honour our refugee convention obligations. Mohammad Bashir Anjum, who is currently held on Nauru, said “our mental health is not good and we rely on medicines to live our daily life”. There is no certainty about the future and what may happen to us. With the small financial allowance no one can afford three meals a day … We have spoken to authorities to request an increase in the financial allowance, and our requests were ignored. You can read more on this, from June, below: New polling from the Australia Institute shows that Australians view the supermarkets as “public enemy No 1” in the cost of living crisis. The Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work surveyed 1,014 voters, and 83% said supermarkets deserve some blame – or a great deal of blame – for the soaring cost of living. It puts the supermarkets ahead of energy companies on 82%, banks at 73%, and the government on 71%. Sixty per cent of voters said groceries had the most notable cost increase – far ahead of the next highest result of utilities at 21%. Sixty-four per cent said they supported increasing supermarket competition. Centre For Future Work senior researcher and report co-author Lisa Heap said the results were “emphatic.” Australians are pointing the finger squarely at supermarkets as public enemy No 1 in the cost-of-living crisis … More people blame supermarkets for the cost-of-living crunch than governments or banks. The public’s appetite for increased supermarket competition is unmistakable. Nearly two-thirds of voters see it as crucial for alleviating cost-of-living pressures … There’s likely to be political rewards for taking actions that increase supermarket competition. The cost of living crisis means people are spending less on essential services, the survey also found, with 37% spending less on heating/cooling their home, 29% spending less on healthy food and 26% less on seeing a doctor. King Charles to arrive in Australia tomorrow Tomorrow, King Charles will touch down in Australia. The six-day tour will take in Sydney and Canberra and is the first visit by a sitting monarch in 13 years. But not everyone is excited. Reporter Kate Lyons tells Matilda Boseley how the King’s visit has reignited the republic debate – even if the government seems to have given up on the idea. Commonwealth Bank has paid a $7.5m fine after the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) found the bank had sent over 170m emails that did not comply with Australian spam laws. The Acma investigation found that between November 2022 and April 2024, CBA had sent over 170m marketing messages to Australians that did not include a way to unsubscribe. Acma found that 34.8m of these messages were also sent to people who either had not consented or had withdrawn their consent to receive these messages. It follows a $3.55m fine against CBA in May last year over 65m emails that did not have working unsubscribe arrangements. Acma chair, Nerida O’Loughlin, said: Australians are sick and tired of this kind of spam intruding on their privacy and it’s clear CBA did not have its systems in order. The rules are clear, if a message includes marketing content or direct links to marketing content, it is a commercial message and must give people the option to unsubscribe. The confusion often lies for businesses in whether messages sent to customers are considered commercial (which would require an unsubscribe option) or non-commercial. Acma has also accepted a three-year court-enforceable undertaking from CBA to address the issues. A spokesperson for CBA said the bank apologised for sending the non-compliant messages, and accepted the findings of the investigation: Timely and relevant information for our customers is incredibly important, and the way we classify that information to meet our regulatory requirements and customer expectations is an absolute priority. We are committed to meeting our obligations and we’re dedicating significant time and resources to this. More on the joint union’s statement Yesterday’s rift between trade union factions coincided with a forum between building and construction contractors and unions and governments on challenges for the sector. At yesterday’s meeting, the National Construction Industry Forum agreed to develop a blueprint for reform due to be delivered in six months’ time. The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, said “working together to address the persistent challenges facing this industry is key to ensuring it is an industry that works for everyone”. Watt later told ABC radio he didn’t believe there was a divide in the trade union movement at all. Watt said: There is no doubt whatsoever that the overwhelming majority of unions and union members support action being taken to clean up the CFMEU. I think that the union movement generally acknowledges that it has been very damaging for the union movement as a whole to have a small number of people within the union movement bring disgrace on the union movement and the very good work that unions do for Australians. Asked whether the split would present issues with the federal government’s reform, Watt said he was “going to get on with it”. We’re going to get on with cleaning up the CFMEU Construction Division and developing a construction industry that works for everyone. If other people want to go and have other meetings, that’s fine. But I’m more convinced than ever, having spoken to the ACTU national executive, that the union movement supports change. A group of more than 20 trade unions have defied the Albanese government’s attempts to overhaul unions within the construction industry after allegations of corruption and criminal links made against the CFMEU earlier this year. Yesterday afternoon, the National Building Industry Group of Unions condemned the federal Labor government for placing the embattled union under administration. In a statement, the group said the CFMEU had been denied “basic natural justice” in a trial by parliament and the media. The statement continued: If a government can legislate outcomes for one union, then all unions are at risk. A union belongs to its members. Union members and their democratically elected leaders decide the future of their union, not knee-jerk legislation. The group, which includes leaders from the CFMEU, and the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU), will hold a Trade Unions for Democracy Summit in December to discuss proposals for the creation of an alternative to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which has backed the government’s response to allegations against to the CFMEU. And happy Thursday – thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today. As always, you can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Four independent crossbenchers will introduce a bill to establish a whistleblower protection authority when Parliament resumes next month. Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie will introduce the proposal, supported by crossbench colleagues Helen Haines, David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie, to create a new body that will support federal whistleblowers, investigate potential retaliation by employers, and ensure disclosures are properly handled. The private member’s bill will come almost a year-and-half after the National Anti-Corruption Commission first opened its doors, and more than a year after the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, confirmed a protection body was one of a number of options under consideration. Dreyfus has previously said the government is “committed to ensuring that Australia has effective protections for whistleblowers”. But Wilkie said the introduction of a standalone protection body was “long overdue”. The government must end the war against whistleblowers by supporting my bill. Only then can we ensure whistleblowers are protected, not punished, prosecuted or imprisoned. The crossbenchers are urging the major parties to support the bill. The announcement coincides with a hearing in the ACT supreme court this morning to determine when former army lawyer David McBride – who is considered by some to be a war crimes whistleblower – will be able to have his appeal heard. McBride was jailed in May for five years and eight months after pleading guilty to three charges in November 2023 of stealing commonwealth information and passing that to journalists at the ABC. The documents formed the basis of the 2017 investigative series exposing alleged war crimes by Australian defence force personnel in Afghanistan, titled the Afghan Files. Big business is urging the federal government to change zoning laws to allow more housing development close to infrastructure and services as part of a push to force a greater focus on increasing housing supply. Before publishing a report next week examining the housing supply challenge, the Business Council of Australia has proposed a program of land rezoning and changes to generate greater consistency in zoning laws across the states and territories. The BCA chief executive, Bran Black, said: We need state and territory governments to unlock more land for homes in cities and towns across Australia so we can fix this supply crisis. These changes need to allow for greater density and height near good transport services, while at the same time protecting the quality of life, green space and heritage of an area. He said there should be more streamlined processes for home builders to put forward their own proposals to boost housing supply thorough rezoning. The BCA is also calling for what it describes as a “competition payment” to create incentives for housing development. Earlier this week, the BCA called for local councils to be forced to set, and abide by, deadlines for making decisions on housing development applications, to ease what it argued had become a bottleneck at the local government level. Australia will donate 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, the federal government has announced. The donation is in addition to previously announced support, which included 120 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles. Government figures indicate the value of the 49 M1A1 Abrams tanks is about $245m in total. It means that the total value of Australia’s military assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country has topped $1.3bn. When non-military support is included, Australia’s overall support to Ukraine is valued at $1.5bn to date. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, will represent Australia at the Nato defence ministers’ meeting in Brussels this week. Australia is not a member of Nato but Conroy is expected to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart. Conroy said in a statement that the tanks would “deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian armed forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine”. The 49 tanks to be donated are near the end of their life. Sources said this meant that a small number of these tanks may need to be fixed by Australia before being delivered. Alternatively, the Australian government has offered to deliver all of the tanks quickly and Ukraine could use the ones with issues for spare parts. It will be left to Ukraine to decide which option to take up. The Australian army, meanwhile, is expected to retain a small number of M1A1 Abrams tanks to assist the transition and introduction of the new M1A2 fleet. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said: Australia’s support for Ukraine has not wavered since Russia’s illegal invasion, and Australia will continue standing with Ukraine. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Emily Wind. In a boost to Ukraine’s war effort – as its president presents a new military strategy dubbed a “victory plan” against Russia – Australia has offered Ukraine almost all of its Abrams tanks, which were due to retire next year. More on this soon. The South Australian bill to change the law on later terminations was narrowly defeated in the state’s upper house last night. By the narrowest margin of 10 votes to nine, the upper house last night voted to reject legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days – an extremely rare occurrence – to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. Anthony Albanese may face renewed backbench pressure to ease capital gains tax concessions, as Labor MPs privately express dismay at his decision to buy a $4.3m waterfront home on the New South Wales Central Coast before an election in the middle of a housing crisis. Meanwhile, big business is urging the federal government to change zoning laws to allow more housing development close to infrastructure and services as part of a push to force a greater focus on increasing housing supply. More coming up. The most prominent republicans concede the challenges they face to have an Australian head of state, but also claim the arrival this week of King Charles and Queen Camilla may be the shot in the arm their campaign needs. We have a full report and analysis, plus our Full Story podcast on the subject. And a group of building industry unions say they plan an alternative to the ACTU as they unite to reject Labor’s crackdown on the CFMEU. More on that also coming up."

                    "bodyText": "Apple’s latest iPhone bucks the trend of buttons vanishing from phones, gaining not one but two new controls on the outside, plus a big jump in chip performance and two-day battery life on the inside. The standard iPhone 16 is Apple’s smallest and lowest-priced handset in the new 16 series, costing from £799 (€959/$799/A$1,399) sitting below the bigger and more expensive 16 Plus and 16 Pro models. The pitch for the vanilla iPhone hasn’t changed in years, offering most of what is good about Apple’s phones but with fewer bells and whistles than its top Pro models. At a glance, the 16 looks identical to the many handsets that have come before it: an aluminium and glass sandwich weighing a relatively light 170g. The 16 even has the same sized 6.1in screen as before, where the Pro models have grown. The display has similar brightness and crispness as the outgoing iPhone 15 and is still stuck at a 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring compared with models with faster screens. It also lacks the Pro iPhone’s always-on display option. The cameras on the back have been rearranged to bring the dual lenses in line, reminiscent of the iPhone 12. That leaves the two new buttons as the main physical upgrades, including the useful action button from the 15 Pro last year that replaces the mute switch and can be used for a variety of functions such as turning on the torch, changing focus modes, recording voice memos and other actions using the Shortcuts app. The standard iPhone also has the same new camera control button as the 16 Pro, which quickly launches the camera, zooms and changes settings, and shoots photos. It runs iOS 18 but lacks Apple’s much-advertised AI features, which won’t arrive in beta as part of iOS 18.1 update until later in October in the US and December for the UK, Australia and other non-US English-speaking countries, while the rest of Europe is out of luck for the foreseeable future. Specifications Screen: 6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A18 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: iOS 18 Camera: 48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm Weight: 170g Faster A18 chip with solid battery life The 16 has a new A18 chip at its heart, which is 30% faster than the two-year-old A16 used in its predecessor with 40% faster graphics. It feels snappier in operation and will stay fast for a long time, as well as enabling the imminent AI features. The chip is also more power efficient, which helps the 16 have very long battery life for a phone this size. It manages to last more than 48 hours between charges for general usage, including a mixture of 5G and wifi, while actively using the screen for more than seven hours. It should last through even the heaviest of days. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £289. The 16 has repair guides available and was awarded seven out of 10 for repairability by specialists iFixit. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The dual camera system on the back of the phone is broadly the same as last year’s model, including a 48MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide, which can be controlled using touch or the new physical camera control button next to the power button. Main camera produces images that are great across a range of lighting conditions, while the 2x in-sensor zoom remains useful in good light but struggles a bit in duller conditions. The ultrawide now has autofocus and a slightly faster lens, producing better photos in dimmer environments. It also enables a macrophotography mode to shoot closeup images at up to 2cm away from the object – a fun feature that was limited to Apple’s Pro models until now. The 16’s camera also has the interesting photographic styles feature from the 16 Pro, which works a bit like advanced filters adjusting the colour, tone and palette of photos either when shooting them or after the fact. The camera can also shoot spatial photos and videos for viewing on headsets such as the Vision Pro, and has the impressive audio mix feature for video from the 16 Pro. Overall, the 16’s camera does a good job in most conditions, but its lack of a telephoto camera holds it back against similarly priced Android rivals. Price The iPhone 16 costs from £799 (€959/$799/A$1,399) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 Plus costs £899, iPhone 16 Pro costs £999, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 9 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,249 and the Fairphone 5 costs £499. Verdict The iPhone 16 may not look that different from the last few iterations of Apple’s standard smartphone but it features a range of updates that make it more interesting than it appears on first glance. The added action button from last year’s 15 Pro is genuinely useful for one-button access to your most used app or feature, such as the torch. The camera control button is equally useful for quickly opening the camera and shooting photos, even if it is a little fiddly to use to adjust settings with any accuracy. The camera itself is solid, capturing great photos pretty easily. The new photographic styles feature and macrophotography are great fun for those that want to get creative. The lack of a real zoom camera, faster and less jerky screen, and always-on display is disappointing. They are features common to rivals but Apple keeps for the iPhone 16 Pro. The much faster chip and solid two-day battery life are very welcome, and should help the iPhone 16 last longer before it needs service or replacing. It may not be the most exciting phone any more, but the iPhone 16 is a big jump up from five-year-old models and is ready to go the distance. Pros: fast, good dual camera with macro mode, decent screen, great size, action button, camera control button, photographic styles, USB-C, great battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, screen slower than competition and Pro iPhones, no always-on display mode, samey design."

                    "bodyText": "The well-groomed young man dressed in a crisp, blue shirt speaking with a soft American accent seems an unlikely supporter of the junta leader of the west African state of Burkina Faso. “We must support … President Ibrahim Traoré … Homeland or death we shall overcome!” he says in a video that began circulating in early 2023 on Telegram. It was just a few months after the dictator had come to power via a military coup. Other videos fronted by different people, with a similar professional-looking appearance and repeating the exact same script in front of the Burkina Faso flag, cropped up around the same time. On a verified account on X a few days later the same young man, in the same blue shirt, claimed to be Archie, the chief executive of a new cryptocurrency platform. These videos are fake. They were generated with artificial intelligence (AI) developed by a startup based in east London. The company, Synthesia, has created a buzz in an industry racing to perfect lifelike AI videos. Investors have poured in cash, catapulting it into “unicorn” status – a label for a private company valued at more than $1bn. Synthesia’s technology is aimed at clients looking to create marketing material or internal presentations, and any deepfakes are a breach of its terms of use. But this means little to the models whose likenesses are behind the digital “puppets” that were used in propaganda videos such as those apparently supporting Burkina Faso’s dictator. The Guardian tracked down five of them. “I’m in shock, there are no words right now. I’ve been in the [creative] industry for over 20 years and I have never felt so violated and vulnerable,” said Mark Torres, a creative director based in London, who appears in the blue shirt in the fake videos. “I don’t want anyone viewing me like that. Just the fact that my image is out there, could be saying anything – promoting military rule in a country I did not know existed. People will think I am involved in the coup,” Torres added after being shown the video by the Guardian for the first time. The shoot In the summer of 2022, Connor Yeates got a call from his agent offering the chance to be one of the first AI models for a new company. Yeates had never heard of the company, but he had just moved to London, and was sleeping on a friend’s couch. The offer – nearly £4,000 for a day’s filming and the use of the images for a three-year period – felt like a “good opportunity”. “I’ve been a model since university and that’s been my primary income ever since finishing. Then I moved to London to start doing standup,” said Yeates, who grew up in Bath. The shoot took place in Synthesia’s studio in east London. First, he was led into hair and makeup. Half an hour later, he entered the recording room where a small crew was waiting. Yeates was asked to read lines while looking directly into the camera, and wearing a variety of costumes: a lab coat, a construction hi-vis vest and hard hat, and a corporate suit. “There’s a teleprompter in front of you with lines, and you say this so that they can capture gesticulations, and replicate the movements. They’d say be more enthusiastic, smile, scowl, be angry,” said Yeates. The whole thing lasted three hours. Several days later, he received a contract and the link to his AI avatar. “They paid promptly. I don’t have rich parents and needed the money,” said Yeates, who didn’t think much of it afterwards. Like Torres’s, Yeates’s likeness was used in propaganda for Burkina Faso’s current leader. A spokesperson for Synthesia said the company had banned the accounts that created the videos in 2023 and that it had strengthened its content review processes and “hired more content moderators, and improved our moderation capabilities and automated systems to better detect and prevent misuse of our technology”. But neither Torres nor Yeates were made aware of the videos until the Guardian contacted them a few months ago. The ‘unicorn’ Synthesia was founded in 2017 by Victor Riparbelli, Steffen Tjerrild and two academics from London and Munich. It launched a dubbing tool a year later that allowed production companies to translate speech and sync an actor’s lips automatically using AI. It was showcased on a BBC programme in which a news presenter who spoke only English was made to look as if he was magically speaking Mandarin, Hindi and Spanish. What earned the company its coveted “unicorn” status was a pivot to the mass market digital avatar product available today. This allows a company or individual to create a presenter-led video in minutes for as little as £23 a month. There are dozens of characters to choose from offering different genders, ages, ethnicities and looks. Once selected, the digital puppets can be put in almost any setting and given a script, which they can then read in more than 120 languages and accents. Synthesia now has a dominant share of the market, and lists Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Zoom, Xerox and Microsoft among its clients. The advances of the product led Time magazine in September to put Riparbelli among the 100 most influential people in AI. But the technology has also been used to create videos linked to hostile states including Russia, China and others to spread misinformation and disinformation. Intelligence sources suggested to the Guardian that there was a high likelihood the Burkina Faso videos that circulated in 2023 had also been created by Russian state actors. The personal impact Around the same time as the Burkina Faso videos started circulating online, two pro-Venezuela videos featuring fake news segments presented by Synthesia avatars also appeared on YouTube and Facebook. In one, a blond-haired male presenter in a white shirt condemned “western media claims” of economic instability and poverty, portraying instead a highly misleading portrait of the country’s financial situation. Dan Dewhirst, an actor based in London and a Synthesia model, whose likeness was used in the video, told the Guardian: “Countless people contacted me about it … But there were probably other people who saw it and didn’t say anything, or quietly judged me for it. I may have lost clients. But it’s not me, it’s just my face. But they’ll think I’ve agreed to it.” “I was furious. It was really, really damaging to my mental health. [It caused] an overwhelming amount of anxiety,” he added. The Synthesia spokesperson said the company had been in touch with some of the actors whose likenesses had been used. “We sincerely regret the negative personal or professional impact these historical incidents have had on the people you’ve spoken to,” he said. But once circulated, the harm from deepfakes is difficult to undo. Dewhirst said seeing his face used to spread propaganda was the worst-case scenario, adding: “Our brains often catastrophise when we’re worrying. But then to actually see that worry realised … It was horrible.” The ‘rollercoaster’ Last year, more than 100,000 unionised actors and performers in the US went on strike, protesting against the use of AI in the creative arts. The strike was called off last November after studios agreed to safeguards in contracts, such as informed consent before digital replication and fair compensation for any such use. Video games performers remain on strike for the same issue. Last month, a bipartisan bill was introduced in the US, titled the NO FAKES Act and aiming to hold companies and individuals liable for damages for violations involving digital replicas. However, there are virtually no practical mechanisms for redress for the artists themselves, outside AI-generated sexual content. “These AI companies are inviting people on to a really dangerous rollercoaster,” said Kelsey Farish, a London-based media and entertainment lawyer specialising in generative AI and intellectual property. “And guess what? People keep going on to this rollercoaster, and now people are starting to get hurt.” Under GDPR, models can technically request that Synthesia remove their data, including their likeness and image. In practice this is very difficult. A former Synthesia employee, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, explained that the AI could not “unlearn” or delete what it may have gleaned from the model’s body language. To do so would require replacing the entire AI model. The spokesperson for Synthesia said: “Many of the actors we work with re-engage with us for new shoots … At the start of our collaboration, we explain our terms of service to them and how our technology works so they are aware of what the platform can do and the safeguards we have in place.” He said the company did not allow “the use of stock avatars for political content, including content that is factually accurate but may create polarisation”, and that its policies were designed to stop its avatars being used for “manipulation, deceptive practices, impersonations and false associations”. “Even though our processes and systems may not be perfect, our founders are committed to continually improving them.” When the Guardian tested Synthesia’s technology using a range of disinformation scripts, although it blocked attempts to use one of its avatars, it was possible to recreate the Burkina Faso propaganda video with a personally created avatar and download it, neither of which should be allowed, according to Synthesia’s policies. Synthesia said this was not a breach of its terms as it respected the right to express a personal political stance, but it later blocked the account. The Guardian was also able to create and download clips from an audio-only avatar that said “heil Hitler” in several languages, and another audio-clip saying “Kamala Harris rigged the election” in an American accent. Synthesia took down the free AI audio service after being contacted by the Guardian and said the technology behind the product was a third-party service. The aftermath The experience of learning his likeness had been used in a propaganda video has left Torres with a deep sense of betrayal: “Knowing that this company I trusted my image with will get away with such a thing makes me so angry. This could potentially cost lives, cost me my life when crossing a border for immigration.” Torres was invited to another shoot with Synthesia this year, but he declined. His contract ends in a few months, when his Synthesia avatar will be deleted. But what happens to his avatar in the Burkina Faso video is unclear even to him. “Now I realise why putting faces out for them to use is so dangerous. It’s a shame we were part of this,” he said. YouTube has since taken the propaganda video featuring Dewhirst down, but it remains available on Facebook. Torres and Yeates both remain on the front page of Synthesia in a video advertisement for the company."

                    "bodyText": "There are so many ways to fiddle while Rome burns, or as this season’s weather would have it, gets torn apart by hurricanes and tornadoes and also goes underwater – and, in other places, burns. One particularly pernicious way comes from the men in love with big tech, who are forever insisting that we need some amazing new technology to solve our problems, be it geoengineering, carbon sequestration or fusion – but wait, it gets worse. At an artificial intelligence conference in Washington DC, the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently claimed that “[w]e’re not going to hit the climate goals anyway because we’re not organized to do it” and that we should just plunge ahead with AI, which is so huge an energy hog it’s prompted a number of tech companies to abandon their climate goals. Schmidt then threw out the farfetched notion that we should go all in on AI because maybe AI will somehow, maybe, eventually know how to “solve” climate, saying: “I’d rather bet on AI solving the problem than constraining it.” Eventually is not good enough. A distinguished group of scientists said in a paper published on 8 October: “We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled. We are stepping into a critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis.” We need to pull back from that brink, but Schmidt is arguing for plunging over it, because guys like him are excited about AI. This is like arguing we should jettison the lifeboats and hang out on the sinking ship because what if there was eventually a totally awesome, new kind of lifeboat we can’t even imagine right now? We have the lifeboats now – we have the solutions, and we have had them for a while, and they keep getting better, as in better-designed, more efficient, more affordable and adaptable. We just need to implement them, but they’re just not the solutions a lot of the rich and powerful like. Proposing we go for some false or nonexistent solution has become an excuse constantly deployed as an excuse for not supporting the solutions we have. “Delay is the new denial” became a slogan in the climate movement a few years ago, and maybe “decoy is the new denial” should be added to it, by which I mean proposing we ignore workable present-day solutions in favor of unworkable and nonexistent ones while continuing to burn fossil fuel. One might think that Schmidt, whose net worth is estimated at around $23bn, would devote some time and resources to organizing us to reach our climate goals rather than excuse himself from acting with his dismissive defeatism. But overall billionaires and the very rich are part of the problem, with their outsized power and the dismal ways most of them use it. And their climate impact is obscene – the richest 1% of humanity is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest 66%. Scientists and engineers have been telling us for a very long time what we need to do and how to do it, and most of us already know that what we need to do is make a swift transition away from burning fossil fuels. Protecting forests and other natural systems and redesigning how we live, travel and produce and consume also matter, but phasing out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is the big one. Schmidt lives in California, where we’ve been getting more than 100% of our electricity needs met many days this year by sun, wind and water, and storing the surplus in immense battery systems. Obviously not everything in California runs on electricity, but this is a nice demonstration model of how rapidly a renewable system can scale up. When it comes to some of the tech oligarchs, I suspect the sheer modesty of the solutions – that we should consume less, which means we can produce less, and make this energy transition to a renewable-powered world – is not the kind of gee-whiz rocket science they love. (Though solar and wind technologies are pretty amazing, particularly if you know how rapidly their design has improved, their cost has plummeted and their implementation has spread.) It is in many ways a social solution in which lots of us adjust how we live and how we power our devices, not a grand centralized invention that is super profitable for a few. I do not know if it would be worse to live in a world in which we genuinely did not have the solutions, or to live in one where we have them but are not implementing them on the speed and scale we know we need to. But I know we have the solutions. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

                    "bodyText": "As we approach the end of another jam-packed Tuesday, here’s a look at what’s been keeping us busy: The veteran broadcast journalist George Negus has died at the age of 82. Tributes flowed for the former 60 Minutes host, including from the PM and Ray Martin. The BoM has left Australia on “La Niña watch” but says climate drivers may no longer deliver expected conditions. Anthony Albanese is buying a new home for himself and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, on the NSW Central Coast. It’s not part of his retirement plan, he stressed. Still, not everyone approved. Jobseeker is now just 20% of the average wage, data released by the Australian Council of Social Service for anti-poverty week has revealed. Australia’s peak humanitarian body decried the “lack of consistency” on sanctions. More than 1,000 Palestinians are applying for onshore protection in Australia. Three people were taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney. The Coalition refused to give its view on whether UN peacekeepers in Lebanon should be protected from Israeli attacks. Australia’s race discrimination commissioner condemned the white supremacist rally held in Corowa, in regional NSW, at the weekend. Finally, more than 48% of Australia’s low-income households are now experiencing food insecurity. Thank you for joining us. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow. Placing onus of online safety and privacy on individuals a cover for corporate inaction and bad behaviour: Lizzie O’Shea Staying with the SXSW forum in Sydney, where panellists have been discussing the balance between the right to privacy and the right to remain safe while online: The panel of four, which included the privacy commissioner Carly Kind and digital rights advocate Lizzie O’Shea, agreed that online platforms should not be allowed to hide behind the mantra of personal responsibility. As technology develops, including generative AI, safety mechanisms should be inbuilt into the design, the eSafety commissioner said. O’Shea said slating responsibility for both online safety and online privacy to the individual was merely a cover for continued inaction in the regulatory space and bad corporate behaviour. “When you go to the supermarket and buy a tub of yoghurt, you’re not expected to go home and test that it doesn’t have poison in it,” she said. You’re not expected to take responsibility for a large range of relatively important decisions you make about what you put in your body or what you’re exposed to. This is just another example. We have all sorts of ways in which we ask the government to intervene into these dynamics, to shape how the market works, to shape how individuals experience certain products, to hold companies to account when things go wrong. Regulatory balance needed between online safety and privacy, eSafety commissioner tells SXSW A greater level of consistency and regulatory coherence on a global scale is needed to achieve an acceptable balance between the right to privacy and the right to remain safe while online, Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has told a SXSW forum in Sydney. This balance is no more crucial than in the realm of child sexual abuse, she said. “Part of the challenge that we have here is a partially jurisdictional arbitrage by some of the more recalcitrant players … where we’re creating permissive hosting environments for this terrible content to thrive,” she said. When a company uses a privacy mantra as an excuse not to do something that they are technically capable of doing and achieving, that makes me lose my patience, because we see examples across the industry of technological interventions that can work and can balance the two. But we’re seeing recalcitrance in terms of companies simply seeing a business opportunity, or not wanting to take responsibility. Fellow panellist Michael Slater, professor of criminology at UNSW and the director of Childlight in Australia, said the technology sector had been given free rein for more than two decades. “We’ve had 25 years in which the technology sector has been empowered, primarily by governments, to do what it wants,” he said. There’s a very legitimate discussion here around privacy, but unfortunately, privacy is also the way – the language – that industry uses to defend itself against regulation. Salter said a representative survey of 2,000 men the UNSW undertook last year asked about sexual interest in children, and 4.6% of respondents admitted they would have sexual contact with a child under the age of 12 if they knew they would not be caught. “That’s a really significant market segment that in other more regulated industries, TV and movies, radio, print … there is a really restrained capacity for them to profit,” he said. But that’s not true for the technology sector, because emerging out of the libertarianism of the 90s … a sort of ethos around the internet, emerging from Silicon Valley and the technology sector’s self image, this notion of the internet’s independence from the state means independence from state law, independence from terrestrial law. And by and large, the United States government and governments around the world agreed with that posture, that we will essentially suspend the normal regulatory obligations that we impose on other sectors. So we’re dealing with a multitrillion-dollar business sector that has enjoyed a lack of child protection and other obligations that are evident elsewhere. BoM leaves Australia on ‘La Niña watch’ but says climate drivers may no longer deliver expected conditions The Bureau of Meteorology has left Australia on a “La Niña watch” but fewer climate models are now forecasting the phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific will kick into gear this summer. La Niñas have historically been associated with cooler and wetter than average conditions from across north-western Australia to the south-east. In an update the bureau said only five of the seven international climate models they surveyed, including its own, were predicting a La Niña would develop in the coming months. The bureau has warned that Australians should pay a little less attention to climate drivers like La Niña and El Niño because the pattern of global heating of the oceans means they might not deliver the kind of conditions they used to. Instead, the bureau’s long-range outlooks gave the best indicators of likely conditions. The bureau’s update said: Global [sea surface temperatures] remain at near-record levels, with temperatures since July being just short of the record temperatures observed during 2023, yet well above all other years since observations began in 1854. The sustained nature of this significant global ocean heat suggests that climate indicators such as [El Nino and La Nina] and [Indian Ocean Dipole] may not necessarily behave or evolve as they have in the past. Ray Martin has just spoken with the ABC about the death of his 60 Minutes peer, George Negus. The veteran broadcaster has died at the age of 82. Martin said Negus was an “extraordinary character and extraordinary journo”. What you saw of Negus on television was what he was like. There was no one quite like George … I think he became as famous … because he was worthy of it. He was a very good journo, he was very ethical and a very good storyteller, but an even better bloke. He loved the fact he worked for the ABC, and had a high regard for the ABC and Kerry O’Brien, one of his best mates, as well. But he also was anxious to take that across to commercial television. And because he was such a good communicator, he was bringing issues that were really important but also fairly complex to people who hadn’t seen the before … He was able to get some of those stories across and the ideas and the issues across in a way that very few journalists can do, and that’s a great credit to who he was. I guess he was unique. He personalised television, or personalised news and current affairs, but not in an opinionated way. I mean, personally, he was highly opinionated, and you’d have to try and tone him down. But on television, he would listen to other people, despite the fact he’d savage prime ministers and politicians whom he thought had done the wrong thing, not because he didn’t agree with them, but because he thought that they’d made mistakes. When it came to journalism, despite all the criticism [from] people who didn’t understand him and disagreed with him, I think George was balanced. I think George did tell both sides of the story. He listened to people who had different opinions to his. He’d berate them and take them on. But nevertheless … he wasn’t out there as a propagandist, I don’t think ever. I think he was a very good journalist. He certainly treasured the profession, and treasured the fact that you had to be objective and you had to be ethical. George Negus remembered by Nine Entertainment colleagues Nine Entertainment says many of George Negus’s friends and former colleagues at the network are remembering him as “a powerhouse of Australian broadcast journalism”. Negus, who had Alzheimer’s disease, has died at the age of 82. In a statement, Nine said: Negus joined Channel 9 in the late 1970s, legendary producer Gerald Stone recognised his distinctive style and hired George to be one of the founding reporters for the then brand-new current affairs program, 60 Minutes. Along with Ray Martin and Ian Leslie, George instantly became a household name in Australia. He was the reporter with the gruff voice, the big moustache and the bucketload of opinions. George’s trademark way of telling stories ensured he was never accused of being dull. He famously got under the skin of British PM Margaret Thatcher; he flirted with actor Meryl Streep; and he showed his great compassion in an extraordinary interview with Mother Teresa. Nine’s director of television, Michael Healy, said: “Today, Australia lost one of its greatest storytellers. When you watched a George Negus interview it was thoughtful, intelligent, composed. He was always in control.” Kirsty Thomson, 60 Minutes executive producer, said: Everyone at 60 Minutes sends love to George’s family. We are so proud to work at a program that’s always been inspired by George’s trailblazing journalism and globetrotting genius. NSW Young Greens seemingly back vandalism of Labor MP’s office The NSW Young Greens have seemingly backed vandalism to Labor MP Peter Khalil’s office, which occurred early yesterday morning. Victoria police alleged that paint was sprayed and a door was damaged at the MP’s Melbourne electorate office, with an unknown liquid allegedly poured through the door. Khalil said the vandalism included an inverted red triangle, a symbol associated with Hamas and that has been used to indicate Israeli military targets, and that the stench from the unknown substance was “so unbearable that staff immediately closed the door, and five hours later still feel overwhelmed and sick from the intensity”. The NSW Young Greens wrote on Instagram that it considers property damage “as a legitimate form of non-violent direct action”. The NSWYG acknowledges the long standing history of The Greens supporting non-violent direct action. Yesterday, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, denounced the vandalism in a post to X and said “protests must always be peaceful and non-violent”. Everyone should feel safe at work, and we wish Peter Khalil and his team well after this vandalism overnight. The NSW Greens were contacted for comment. Google says proposed misinformation laws would affect ‘exercise of lawful speech’ Google, one of the world’s biggest multinational tech companies, has said the Albanese government’s proposed law to counter misinformation would “ultimately impact the exercise of lawful speech in Australia”. The law, introduced in September, would give the communications and media regulator more powers to categorise material publicly shared as “reasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive and reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”. In a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the bill, Google said it was supportive of efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation, but didn’t agree with the government’s approach. The search engine turned tech conglomerate said there weren’t “clear guardrails” for the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s oversight and enforcement powers. Under the bill, ACMA would be given new information-gathering and record-keeping powers to force tech companies to hand over details on how they self-regulate. Elsewhere in its submission, Google also suggested the bill focus on disinformation – where false information is intentionally and deceptively shared – rather than misinformation. Its submission said: Unlike misinformation, disinformation involves an intent to deceive and as a result is more objectively assessable. It has been narrowly defined in other instruments around the world, including the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. It is also the class of content that carries the greater risk of harm to Australia. The Australian government has said it is “appalled by the unacceptable deaths of innocent civilians as a result of Israel’s operations in Gaza”. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, made the comment this afternoon and reiterated that Australia was calling for civilians to be protected. Wong’s spokesperson added: We also remain gravely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza and UN reports that northern Gaza is increasingly being cut off from essential supplies due to access restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities. This cannot continue. The spokesperson said Israel “must comply” with the international court of justice’s binding orders, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale in Gaza: Australia has repeatedly conveyed its concerns about the situation in Gaza directly to Israel. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price for defeating Hamas. We repeat our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the unconditional release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance. Parties must agree to the plan put forward by the United States and endorsed by the United Nations security council. Delays are costing lives. Man charged with assault on NSW north coast A man has been charged after an alleged assault on New South Wales’ north coast. Emergency services were called to a caravan park on Lawson Street in Byron Bay at about 3:30am, after reports of an assault, NSW police said. A 39-year-old man was found with a serious head injury. He was treated at the scene before being airlifted to Gold Coast university hospital in a critical condition. Another 39-year-old man was arrested at the scene and taken to Byron Bay police Station. He was charged with affray and granted conditional bail to appear before Byron Bay local court in November. PM remembers journalist George Negus as a ‘wonderful human being’ Another look at some of the tributes that are landing on social media following the announcement of the death of veteran broadcaster George Negus. Anthony Albanese called Negus, who died at the age of 82, “a wonderful human being”. “George sought and served the truth with steely determination and a twinkle in his eye, and along the way, he made even the smallest TV screen feel that much bigger”, he wrote on X. Digital payments ‘much cheaper than cash’, Labor MP tells ABC amid proposal to scrap debit card transaction fees Over to Afternoon Briefing, where host Greg Jennett is exploring the Labor government’s proposal to scrap debit card surcharges. Jerome Laxale from the Labor-held Sydney seat of Bennelong told the ABC that the argument that digital payment systems had embedded costs held no water. All these arguments fall apart when you compare digital payments to cash. There have been embedded costs for cash for millennia that have been carried in certain ways, particularly by banks – and even recently banks said they are paying up to $350 million each to circulate cash around. As they should. We know digital payments are effectively much cheaper than cash. We had evidence of that nature at the bank hearing. He said surcharges were a “byproduct of laws that are now approaching 20 years old. They need updating.” Sydney rail commuters told to allow extra travel time after person seen near tracks at Redfern Sydney Trains has advised commuters to allow extra travel time after a person was seen near the train tracks in Redfern on Tuesday afternoon. Several train lines are experiencing delays due to the incident, including T1, T3, and T8, the Daily Telegraph reports. T2 and T5 were affected but have returned to normal service, according to Sydney Trains. In a social media post, Sydney Trains said: “Allow extra travel time due to a person near the tracks at Redfern earlier. Stops may change at short notice.” Tributes are pouring in for the veteran journalist and broadcaster George Negus, who has died at the age of 82. Journalists and public figures including Kate McClymont, Peter FitzSimons, Phillip Adams and Sandra Sully have all taken to X to share the news. Echoing the comments of many, award-winning investigative journalist McClymont wrote: “Vale George Negus, one of the greats.” Author and commentator FitzSimons said: “Vale George Negus. Lovely bloke. Larrikin. Tv pioneer. Strong and fearless journalist.” Severe thunderstorm warning for western NSW The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of New South Wales. Residents in the state’s west have been told to expect damaging winds, large hail and heavy rainfall: The bureau earlier warned of possible thunderstorms across much of the country’s south east: Veteran broadcaster George Negus has died at the age of 82. In a statement, Negus’ family said he had Alzheimer’s disease and “passed away peacefully surrounded by loved ones”, the ABC reports. “Despite the challenges diseases like Alzheimer’s inflict on families, we still shared beautiful times, laughter and happiness together in recent times. “We also learnt a lot.” The family thanked healthcare workers for their support. Many thanks for joining me on today’s blog, Daisy Dumas will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. Australian shares hit another record high The Australian share market has climbed to another record high, AAP reports, with contributions from the big banks and the major miners. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 58 points, or 0.7%, to 8,310.8 at noon – its first time ever above 8,300. The broader All Ordinaries was up 55.4 points, or 0.65%, to 8,584.1. Eight of the ASX’s 11 sectors were higher at midday, with energy and utilities lower and consumer staples basically flat. The heavyweight financial sector was the biggest gainer, rising 1.3% as Westpac and CBA both climbed 1.7%, NAB added 1.5% and ANZ gained 0.9%. In the heavyweight mining sector, BHP was up 1.1%, Fortescue had added 2.3% and Rio Tinto had advanced 1.6%. The energy sector was lower after Brent crude slumped to a 12-day low of $US75 a barrel after bearish economic data out of China. Woodside was 1.6% lower, Santos had dropped 1.3% and Whitehaven Coal had dropped 2%. The Australian dollar was buying US67.32c, from US67.41c at Monday’s ASX close. Watch: emergency services respond to chemical flash at Sydney uni As we reported earlier, three people have been taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney’s Sports Aquatic Centre in Darlington this morning. One employee and two bystanders were affected by the acid-based chemicals, with one person sustaining burns to his hands. The area has since been secured and analysed, before being decontaminated and rendered safe. Here’s some footage from the scene, thanks to our video team and Fire and Rescue NSW: Opera House to be lit up for King after coronation snub The sails of the Sydney Opera House will be lit up for the upcoming royal visit, AAP reports, despite the New South Wales premier previously axing plans to similarly mark the King’s coronation due to cost. The state government plans to illuminate the landmark at 8pm on Friday with pictures of previous royal visits to Sydney. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will tour the NSW capital and Canberra after landing on Australian soil on 18 October. The green light to illuminate the sails comes almost 18 months after the premier, Chris Minns, dumped plans set by the former Coalition state government to light up the venue for the King’s coronation. The cost of $80,000-$100,000 per night was too much for taxpayers to bear, he said at the time. But Minns today said it was important the King was warmly welcomed during his visit to Sydney, and the “primary objective” in lighting up the Opera House would be to focus on events taking place in the state capital. The Opera House sails were illuminated for 23 days in 2012 but that ballooned to more than 70 days in 2022, costing taxpayers up to $7m annually. Requests to the government were still increasing and included “trivial matters”, the premier said previously. Friday’s display will include a four-minute looping montage of images from previous royal visits. Australia’s peak body for humanitarian agencies has accused the Australian government of a lack of consistency in ensuring accountability for human rights violations, citing a failure to impose any sanctions on Israeli government or military officials. The federal government announced today that it was imposing targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranian individuals linked to Iran’s missile program. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Iran’s missile program posed “a material threat to regional and international security” and that its ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October “was a dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war”. The Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) said in a statement that it was “horrified at the rising bombardment and civilian death toll in Northern Gaza over the last several days”. The peak body said it “urges the Australian government to assert accountability and apply autonomous sanctions on Israeli officials engaged in killing civilians, consistent with the approach it has taken towards other combatants committing war crimes”. Naomi Brooks, the humanitarian lead for Acfid, said: The Australian government has implemented sanctions on 200 Iran-linked individuals and entities. Despite over 40,000 deaths in Gaza, the Australian government has not yet sanctioned any Israeli government or military officials. This now looks like a lack of consistency and proportionality in how we hold governments committing gross human rights violations to account. After over a year of conflict, we have continued to see atrocities throughout Gaza, including horrific scenes at Al-Aqsa hospital where civilians were burned alive. The human toll has been beyond catastrophic. We urgently need a ceasefire. Comment is being sought from the Australian government. Teenager accused of woman’s murder seeks police evidence A teenage boy accused of murdering a grandmother during a carjacking has been granted a court order for prosecutors to disclose all evidence in the case, AAP reports. Vyleen Joan White, 70, died after being stabbed in the chest outside a shopping centre at Redbank Plains, west of Brisbane, on 3 February. Police alleged White was killed during the theft of her 2009 model Hyundai Getz hatchback. A 16-year-old boy from the nearby suburb of Bellbird Park was arrested two days later and charged with one count each of murder and unlawful use of a motor vehicle, and three counts of stealing. The youth’s charges were mentioned in Ipswich children’s court today, but he was not required to appear in person or via video link from custody. Prosecutor Andy Iordache told acting magistrate Paul Byrne she could have a complete brief of evidence ready within three weeks. The youth’s solicitor, Farshad Sarabi, asked Byrne for an order for prosecutors to produce the last items of evidence. Byrne ordered the prosecution to disclose the last items of evidence by 5 November and adjourned the matter until 26 November. Sarabi said outside court that the case was “sad for everyone” and “there are no winners in this situation”. When asked about the time it had taken for evidence to be disclosed, Sarabi said: “I think everyone is frustrated by the delays.” The Bureau of Meteorology has released a severe weather update, with possible severe thunderstorms forecast for much of the southeast: Rock band Oasis has announced a fifth and final Australian concert as part of their 2025 reunion tour, after huge demand. All four stadium shows in Melbourne and Sydney sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale. A fifth and final concert has now been announced for Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium on Monday 4 November. This means Oasis will perform three nights in Melbourne, and two at Accor Stadium in Sydney, on the following dates: Friday 31 October – Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (SOLD OUT) Saturday 1 November – Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (SOLD OUT) Monday 4 November – Marvel Stadium, Melbourne (EXTRA SHOW ADDED) Friday 8 November – Accor Stadium, Sydney (SOLD OUT) Saturday 9 November – Accor Stadium, Sydney (SOLD OUT) A statement said there would be a presale for existing registered fans who missed out during the initial presale ballot. Tickets will go on sale for the general public from midday this Friday, 18 October. Bureau of Meteorology releases 2025 weather calendar The Bureau of Meteorology has released its weather calendar for 2025, featuring space weather, a total solar eclipse and an elusive optical effect caused by light bending through fog. The photos traverse throughout Australia’s many climate zones – from Tasmania’s central highlands in the south to the Arafura Sea off the Northern Territory – taken by professional and amateur photographers. National community information manager Andrea Peace said the images were selected from more than 500 entries, with each month featuring a different weather phenomenon “alongside a meteorological description written by the Bureau’s meteorologists.” The weather calendar is now in its 41st year and can be bought online here. Here are some of the photos featured in this year’s calendar: The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, claims the government’s announcement about banning debit card surcharges was only “a plan for a plan”, criticising Labor for not yet following through on promised reforms to gambling ads and social media age limits. Returning to his earlier press conference in Sydney, Dutton said the Coalition was “very happy to look at anything the government is going to propose, but it’s not an announcement. It’s just that they’re looking at it and it could come in in 2026.” Australian families need help now from this government. At the moment, it’s a plan for a plan. Dutton went on to note: The government promised to introduce reforms to online gambling – nothing’s happened. They promised to introduce age verification – nothing has happened. The government makes all of these announcements, but never delivers anything, and I think this is just the latest example. It’s a line reminiscent of Anthony Albanese’s criticism of Scott Morrison before the last election, accusing the then PM of being “all photo op, no follow-up”. Dutton’s opposition seem keen to point out the government’s delay on various promises; in parliament’s question time last week, Coalition MPs asked Labor several questions on the long-delayed gambling ad reforms. Now, 16 months after Peta Murphy’s report recommending a full ad ban, it is unclear when the government will announce its response. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, last week promised a response before the election. More information on chemical flash at University of Sydney Fire and Rescue NSW has just released some more information on the chemical reaction at the University of Sydney, as we flagged a moment ago. The chemical reaction occurred outside the University of Sydney Sports Aquatic Centre in Darlington, about 10am. One employee and two bystanders were affected by the acid-based chemicals, FRNSW said, which were being moved for disposal. One person received burns to his hands and was taken to hospital, and a further two people were also transported as a precaution. The area has since been secured and analysed, before being decontaminated and rendered safe. SafeWork and the NSW EPA have been notified of the incident. The number of Palestinians applying onshore for protection in Australia has surpassed 1,000 since October 2023 as the federal government unveils a new temporary humanitarian pathway option for those fleeing the conflict in Gaza. Home affairs department figures for September, tabled in the Senate yesterday, show 118 from the Palestinian Authority applied for onshore protection visas in September 2024, bringing the total of applications to 1,033 since October 2023. Protection visa applications for Palestinians peaked in July with 176 for the month after steadily rising from January. So far, the figures show none of the protection visas have been granted. Last Thursday, the department published new details about its temporary humanitarian stay visas, allowing newly arrived Palestinians the possibility of a three-year visa. The option is similar to the pathway offered to Ukrainians fleeing the country following Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The temporary visa is only available by invitation from the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, or any delegates, but those affected by the conflict can fill out an expression of interest form to be considered. The two-step process would see an individual being granted a subclass 449 Humanitarian Stay (Temporary) visa initially – a visa that does not grant Medicare access. Individuals would then be offered a subclass 786 Temporary (Humanitarian Concern) visa, which is valid for three years. The department warned “individuals who are offered a temporary humanitarian stay cannot meet the criteria for and be granted a protection visa, regardless of whether they have already lodged an application”. Guardian Australia asked Burke for the number of individuals offered a 449 or 786 visa through the pathway on Friday. The minister’s office declined to comment. Three people have been taken to hospital after a minor chemical flash at the University of Sydney. Fire and Rescue NSW said it was called to the workplace incident just before 10am today, along with paramedics, after reports one person had suffered burns from a chemical reaction. He has been taken to Royal Prince Alfred hospital with minor burns, after “exposure to the vapour cloud that came off the reaction” inside a plastic bucket. Two other people were transported to RPA as a precaution. FRNSW crews are working to decontaminate areas where people washed-off after the chemical flash – described as a “rapid release of heat”. We’ve actually just recovered the remaining product of the chemicals that have been mixed together and put them into proper storage recovery bins … Now we’re just working through to continue to decontaminate so we can open this site back up. NSW Ambulance confirmed it had transported the three patients, but did not have an update on their condition. Max Chandler-Mather hits out at ‘property investor’ PM The Greens MP and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, has weighed in on Anthony Albanese’s purchase of a home on New South Wales’ Central Coast with his fiancee, Jodie Haydon. In a post to X labelling the prime minister a “property investor”, Chandler-Mather said: Labor [and] the Liberals have created a housing system where a property investor can buy a $4.3m beachfront home, while millions can’t even find an affordable rental, let alone buy a house of their own. Yet Labor still want to give property investors $176bn in tax handouts. Coalition silent on peacekeeper safety in Lebanon The Coalition has refused to give its view on whether UN peacekeepers in Lebanon should be protected from Israeli attacks. As reported here on the blog yesterday, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gave a statement to Guardian Australia saying that Australia had “made clear to Israel that any targeting or intimidation of UN personnel and facilities in Lebanon is unacceptable and must cease”. There have been further developments overnight, including the UN security council issuing a statement urging “all parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and premises” and saying “UN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack”. The foreign affairs ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK also issued a joint statement expressing “our deep concern in the wake of recent attacks by [the Israel Defense Forces] on Unifil bases, which have left several peacekeepers injured” and that “these attacks must stop immediately”. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denied accusations that Israel “deliberately attacked Unifil personnel” but said “the best way to assure the safety of Unifil personnel is for Unifil to heed Israel’s request and to temporarily get out of harm’s way”. Today Guardian Australia asked the opposition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, for comment about the protection of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, including whether the Australian government was right to make the call it did and whether Unifil was right to reject unilateral calls to move. Birmingham’s office said that they would not be providing comment. Overseas arrivals and departures figures released The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released its latest overseas arrivals and departures figures. Permanent arrivals in August were down from the same month last year but are up about a third from 2019. Short-term visitors were up 9.2% on last year, with most tourists coming from New Zealand, China and Japan. In New South Wales and Victoria, China was the No 1 source country for tourists. In Tasmania and Western Australia, the tourist market was dominated by Singaporeans. More residents are holidaying overseas, with short-term resident returns up to 916,890 – an increase of 6.8% on one year earlier. For these people, at least, the cost-of-living crisis may not be hitting home. But more people chose to leave and not return to Australia. Total departures were well up, increasing to 1,694,440 – an increase of 11.7% on one year earlier. The PM has been asked about his purchase of a home on New South Wales’ Central Coast with his fiancee, Jodie Haydon. Well, Jodie and I are getting married, as is known, and I’m pleased about that. And Jodie’s a Coastie. She’s a proud Coastie … There are three generations of Haydons on the coast there. And when your relationship changes, your life changes, and you make decisions. He said he was yet to buy the Copacabana home and, when asked if he planned to retire there, he said he was “planning to be in [his] current role for a very long time”. Clare O’Neil says Labor ‘came from a standing start’ on housing crisis The prime minister is in Queensland, where he has been lending his weight to the Miles government’s re-election campaign. Speaking alongside the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, in Logan, he has just announced a planned 1,100 new homes for the area as part of the government’s target to build 1.2m homes around the country over the next five years. O’Neil said: We are, without question, one of the boldest and most ambitious commonwealth governments on housing that we have seen for a generation in this country. We came from a standing start. The prime minister here mentioned that for most of the time the Coalition were in power, they didn’t even have a housing minister. Didn’t even have a housing minister: that’s how tapped out they were on this critical problem. When asked about Labor’s plan to drop debit card fees, Anthony Albanese said: We think it’ll make a difference. And when people go and they see a price up on the board and the business where they’re making a purchase, that should be the purchase price. There shouldn’t be hidden charges and surcharges there when people are using their own money … The debit card is taking money directly from people’s accounts. That is their money, and there shouldn’t be surcharges on it. More information on latest jobseeker data Currently, 60% of households relying on jobseeker live below the poverty line. Acoss is urging the federal government to increase Jobseeker from $56 a day to at least $82 a day to bring it in line with the pension. Jobseeker and related income support payments should be indexed to the higher of wage growth or inflation, instead of just inflation, Goldie said: As prices continue to rise and wages increase, it is vital that unemployment and related payments are adjusted to reflect the reality of living costs. We cannot allow people out of paid work to fall further behind, pushing more people into poverty. Acoss is also advocating for a strategy to halve poverty by 2030, including setting national targets and definitions of poverty, increasing investment in social housing and First Nations organisations and creating more employment opportunities for those facing barriers to paid work. Jobseeker is now just 20% of the average wage, data released by Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) for anti-poverty week has revealed. While the average wage in Australia is $1,923 a week, jobseeker is just $393, the Acoss briefing on solutions to poverty shows. The payment is only 43% of the $916-per-week minimum wage, and has dropped to just 69% of the $572-per-week pension. Youth Allowance at $319.50 a week is even lower, making up just 17% of the average wage, 35% of the minimum wage and 56% of the pension. It is also far below the Henderson poverty line, which is $1,224.94 a fortnight for a single person. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said it was time to raise the rate: Australia’s totally inadequate income support payments are a primary cause of poverty in one of the wealthiest nations on Earth. Our unemployment payment is among the lowest in the OECD. It is a political choice and driving persistent poverty. People receiving youth allowance or jobseeker are falling further behind both people in paid work and pensioners. Every day, people doing it tough are forced to go hungry, forgo essential medicine, and worry about finding or keeping a roof over their head. One of the quickest and most effective ways to lift people out of poverty is to raise the rate. Race discrimination commissioner condemns white supremacist rally at the weekend Australia’s Race Discrimination Commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, has condemned the white supremacist rally held in Corowa, in regional NSW, at the weekend. On Sunday, a group of balaclava-wearing men were spotted huddled under a sign that read “white man fight back”. A video posted online showed the group’s leader suggesting white people were being “pushed out” of their towns. Sivaraman said the Corowa rally was “a shock to many, particularly residents”, but for those who have been “following the rise of the far right in the last few years, it sadly wasn’t that surprising”. This is what happens when we refuse to properly name and confront the extent of racism that is ingrained across our society. These rallies are a horrific manifestation of what happens when racism is normalised – to the extent that neo-Nazis are emboldened to be on the streets as a threatening force … White supremacy is a threat that must be taken seriously. We should never forget that the worst mass murder in recent history committed by an Australian was a white supremacist in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. Politicians need to be careful their language does not denigrate one community over another or embolden neo-Nazis to openly march on our streets. Australian media also needs to be careful about which ideologies it platforms. He called for a national anti-racism action that “addresses the roots of white supremacy and all forms of racism in Australia”. Dandenong MP shaving head to raise money for Cancer Council Victoria Dandenong MP Gabrielle Williams is about to shave her head to raise money for Cancer Council Victoria, after her friend and Mulgrave MP Eden Foster’s cancer diagnosis earlier this year. Peter Dutton says Anthony Albanese’s purchase of a $4.3m luxury coastal home north of Sydney is “a matter for the prime minister”, but said he had concerns about ordinary Australians struggling with their mortgage. In a press conference in Sydney, Dutton was asked about Albanese’s latest property purchase at Copacabana. Dutton responded: “It’s a matter for the prime minister, but I wish he and Jodie [Haydon, his fiance] well, and they’re obviously planning for the next stage of life, post-politics. And I wish them well.” Dutton said “the prime minister can answer questions in relation to it” but went on to say: But the homeowners in Australia that I’m worried about at the moment are people who can’t afford their mortgages. People have had 12 interest rate increases, and interest rates should come back, as they’re doing in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand, but because of Mr Albanese’s bad economic management, we’re seeing inflation remain higher here and therefore, interest rates remain higher as well. Pesutto rubbishes claims from Allan he is untrustworthy Circling back to Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto, who has rubbished suggestions made by the premier, Jacinta Allan, that he was untrustworthy. As she arrived at parliament this morning, Allan had said: For weeks the Liberal party have been slugging it out in court with each other, contesting the question of John Pesutto’s character, and it is being exposed as being entirely untrustworthy … His own colleagues think that and it demonstrates that Victorians can neither trust him or the Victorian Liberal party. But Pesutto disputed this characterisation and said he would not stoop to “personal attacks”. My focus is on what the Victorian people need, and I’d like some answers from the premier on a range of issues. Laneway says presale ‘issue’ now resolved Circling back to the Laneway presale for a moment: in a post to its update channel on Instagram, Laneway says it is “aware of an issue with the pre-sale journey”. We have been made aware of an issue with the pre-sale journey, which should now be resolved and everyone should be able to purchase. Laneway is encouraging those who are struggling to clear their cache, try incognito mode or use a different browser. Pesutto says he will continue to ‘work hard’ for Liberal leadership John Pesutto says he was “brought up to be very resilient” and would continue to “work hard for everything”, including the Liberal leadership. Asked whether today’s meeting put leadership speculation to bed, or if he believes this uncertainty will continue until the trial is over and the findings released, John Pesutto said: I’m just going to focus on my job and working with tenacity to give the Victorian people a real choice, both now and in November 2026 and that requires a lot of work from my colleagues and I. I think what I’d say about my colleagues today is that we’ve come out of our meeting today with a real sense of the purpose we have in the mission we have, which is to replace this government, but to do it for the reasons that we need better leadership of our state. Pesutto bats off question about Liberal spill after trial wraps up Asked whether Liberal MPs have indicated a spill will go ahead after the trial wraps up, John Pesutto batted off the question. He said opposition is “a long journey and we are focused on the work ahead”. That’s all we can really do ... Coming out of today’s meeting, there’s a real sense of purpose and mission that we are having an impact on the debate in the state, and we need change in the state, and we need better leadership in the state. ‘I’m not going to go into party room matters,’ Pesutto says John Pesutto said he won’t discuss party matters, but admitted he raised the defamation trial with Liberal MPs as part of his “recap of the last month”. I’m not going to go into party room matters, as you can appreciate. But look, I’m happy to say there was just a general recap on where we’ve been going, with particular focus on the fact that we’re resonating with the Victorian people. It is clear that the Allan Labor government is losing support at a rapid rate – and that’s right across the state, and there’s good reason for that. Pesutto confirms spill motion against him failed to eventuate Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has just emerged from the Liberal party room after a spill against him failed to eventuate. Several MPs had spent last week planning a spill, citing Pesutto’s ongoing defamation trial brought Moira Deeming as a reason, but it failed to go ahead as they were unable to agree upon a replacement candidate. Emerging from the party room, Pesutto confirmed there was no spill: I don’t know what all that was about but everybody’s focused on the job ahead. We’ve got a government that is not leading our state well. We’ve got roads in a state of disrepair that are dangerous for people to use. The health system hasn’t been fixed. The budget is a mess. Debt is continuing to rise in this state, putting enormous pressure on Victorian households and businesses. So there is a lot to prosecute here in the parliament. Update on Oasis and Laneway tickets queue If you’re wondering whether you have the time to queue up online for Oasis tickets, our spy says don’t worry: the two Melbourne concerts just went on general sale, there are still seats available all over the stadium, and there’s no online queue. On the other hand, another spy is #24,698 in the queue for Laneway in Sydney, and another is #36,485 for the Melbourne stop, so yet again gen X have an unfair advantage over the millennials in getting what they want. Images of storm damage in Sydney and surrounds The NSW State Emergency Service has shared these images of the storm damage in Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and surrounds yesterday afternoon: Expansion of NSW entertainment precincts to protect venues from noise complaints People who buy homes near pubs and music venues in some areas will be discouraged from making noise complaints, AAP reports, as special entertainment precincts will be expanded in the NSW government’s second tranche of “vibrancy reforms” – to be introduced to parliament today. Buyers will be required to formally acknowledge they are purchasing property in an entertainment zone when snapping up real estate within the precincts. Just one precinct has been established to date, on Enmore Road in Sydney’s inner west, but the arts minister, John Graham, wants more in a bid to revive the state’s ailing nightlife industry. It is about cutting the red tape that has strangled nightlife over time and made local live music and performance at venues in many cases the exception rather than the rule. It is also hoped the laws will put an end to conflict between established venues and new neighbours. Graham said: People moving into an established entertainment zone will now do so with their eyes wide open through property search documents and we expect this will reduce conflict between neighbours and venues over time. Allan says ‘existing engagements’ means she can’t attend King Charles’ reception in Canberra The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been asked why she and the other state premiers have declined their invitations for a reception in Canberra next Monday to mark King Charles’s first visit to Australia since taking the throne. She said she has a number of “exisiting engagements”: The Victorian community will be very well represented by the governor, by the King’s representative in the state. The government will further be represented by the parliamentary secretary to the premier. Despite this she said she welcomed the King’s trip and “we would have warmly welcomed him to Melbourne and Victoria should his itinerary have made some time and space for that visit”. … particularly given the King went to school here in Geelong and we’re really proud of that personal connection with the King and his family. His schedule was such that his visit is confined to Canberra and Sydney, and my schedule is such that I’m just not able to make the reception next Monday, but the government [and] the Victorian community, will be very, very well represented by the governor of Victoria, who is indeed the King’s representative. But Allan was quick to note she has “long been on the record as supporting Australia becoming a republic”, though it was not a focus “right now”. An offender has fled the scene of a botched ram raid at a cycling store with their arm on fire after the business erupted into flames, AAP reports. Mystery culprits allegedly used a stolen car to ram the garage door of a business on Lygon Street, Brunswick, in Melbourne’s inner north about 2.55am this morning, police said. It is believed the offenders used the black BMW X5 to ram the door two or three times, before jumping out of the vehicle and entering the store. The ramming then led to a fire inside the business. It was reported to police that one of the offenders was spotted fleeing the scene with one of their arms on fire. The stolen vehicle was left behind and the offenders were last seen running towards Nicholson Street. The fire caused significant damage to the building and it remains unclear if anything was stolen from the store. Oasis general sale to begin shortly, plus Laneway presale The general public sale for the 2025 reunion tour of 90s rock band Oasis go on sale in just over 10 minutes. According to Ticketmaster, tickets have been priced in advance by the tour from $183.28 to $407.57. A handling fee from $9.90 per order also applies, and tickets are subject to availability. Ticketmaster says if anyone gets a message they were unable to reserve their chosen seats, it means someone has already secured them – and they should clear their selection and try different seats. Meanwhile, presale for the 2025 Laneway festival also opens from 10am AEDT, with the festival to be headlined by Charli xcx. Man charged with 87 counts of theft allegedly part of syndicate Victoria police have charged a man who was allegedly part of a retail theft syndicate. Detectives travelled to NSW on 11 October to investigate reports of a large shop steal syndicate, allegedly responsible for thefts of grocery products last year and this year. It’s alleged the group were conducting large-scale thefts of high-value products from supermarkets, Victoria police said, worth more than $3m. Detectives will allege the 27-year-old Indian national was part of the syndicate of more than 100 people. He was extradited from NSW and charged with 87 counts of theft. Australia must ‘exercise all political and diplomatic influence’ to ensure humanitarian aid to Gaza, says Save the Children Save the Children Australia is urging the Albanese government to “exercise all political and diplomatic influence it has” to stop Israel from cutting humanitarian aid to children and families trapped in northern Gaza. On Saturday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half of Gaza. The UN says an estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the latest ground fighting and artillery fire centred in Jabalia, which has now entered a second week. Save the Children Australia CEO Mat Tinkler said: The Australian Government must state loud and clear that using starvation as a weapon of war is a war crime and that perpetrators have to be held accountable. As is so often the case in conflict, the people least able to evacuate will be children (particularly those who have been orphaned) the elderly, the sick and injured and people with disabilities. If aid is cut off, the denial of food, water and medicine to these people will effectively be signing their death warrants. Save the Children says that according to the UN World Food Program, no food aid has entered northern Gaza since 1 October. Circling back to Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young’s interview on ABC RN earlier where she was asked about the ticketing situation for live music – and said she was worried by some of the allegations aired on Four Corners last night. Hanson-Young said she was concerned by the notion “audience members are [allegedly] being ripped off because of price surging on tickets or hidden fees on ticket prices.” If there is issues there, the ACCC should investigate them and make clear that any anti-competitive or unfair charges are not happening and being passed on to audience members. The Senator said the live music industry is “copping it from all sides right now”, still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and dealing with the cost-of-living crisis. I do think the ACCC should have a look at this and work out if there’s unfair practices. But I also think governments need to do more to support Australian musicians and artists. We are on the verge of losing an entire generation of artists in this country because of these issues and, you know, it’s such an important part of what makes us the great country that we are. Art helps us understand what we’re going through, where we’ve come from, where we’re going. It helps us to communicate, to connect. There’s a lot of pressures right now and music and art really helps us as a community to come together when times are tough and we need it more than ever right now. The Liberal party room has just wrapped up with no spill motion, as we had earlier reported. MPs have told Guardian Australia the 45-minute meeting was “friendly”, “agreeable”, “boring” and “nothing special”. Leader in the upper house, Georgie Crozier, said only Pesutto mentioned the defamation trial “in passing”. We’re putting it behind us. She said “not one” MP raised concerns about Pesutto’s leadership. Woman charged with domestic violence murder after man allegedly found unconscious Queensland police have charged a 32-year-old woman with murder after the sudden death of a man at Browns Plains yesterday. Emergency services were called to the Basie Court address after the 72-year-old man was allegedly found unconscious and not breathing. Police said the 32-year-old Browns Plains woman was taken into custody at the scene, and has since been charged with murder (domestic violence). She is due to appear in Beenleigh magistrates court today. Investigations are ongoing, police said. Residential vacancy rates fell slightly in September: SQM research Residential dwelling vacancy rates fell slightly across the country to 1.2% in September, according to SQM Research. There are currently 37,932 rental vacancies, a decrease from 39,665 in August. Perth, Canberra and Hobart – plus regional Australia – were the main drivers to the decline, according to the data. Sydney’s rental vacancy rate remains stable at 1.6% with 11,360 vacant rentals. Melbourne’s has increased to 1.7% with 8,796 vacant dwellings. Canberra had the highest rental vacancy rate among the states and territories at 2%. Vacancy rates in the CBDs were largely steady, with Sydney at a 5% vacancy rate and Melbourne at 5.1%. In the month leading to 12 October, rental prices in capital cities rose by 0.5%. Sydney experienced a 0.9% increase in combined rents, where Melbourne saw a 1.1% decline. Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said the national rental market “remains in severe shortage and barring some exceptions, is not expected to materially soften out of the rental crisis for some years”. Victorian Liberal MPs are filing into their party room for their first meeting since the beginning of the defamation trial brought against opposition leader, John Pesutto, by exiled MP Moira Deeming. The trial, which has aired the party’s dirty laundry, prompted calls last week from some MPs to spill the leadership. However, several MPs have told Guardian Australia the motion is unlikely to go ahead because the party room is unable to agree upon a candidate to replace Pesutto. Pesutto walked into his party room with members of his leadership team, Georgie Crozier, Evan Mulholland and David Southwick, and South West Coast MP, Roma Britnell. He told reporters: “Back to work.” The Berwick MP, Brad Battin, who has long been touted as a possible leader, was the first to arrive and said he had no plans to move a motion. Another contender, Nepean MP Sam Groth, said: “You’re all wasting your time.” Guy Barnett has been elected as Tasmania’s new deputy premier. The Tasmanian government whip, Simon Wood, said in a statement the Liberal party met this morning to elect a new deputy leader, and Barnett was elected unopposed. This comes as the former deputy premier, Michael Ferguson, was set to face a no-confidence motion in parliament today but resigned from the cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout. Barnett spent nearly a decade in the federal Senate before being elected to Tasmanian state parliament in 2014 as the member for Lyons. Albanese buys house on NSW Central Coast for $4.3m News.com.au is reporting that Anthony Albanese has purchased a new home for himself and fiance, Jodie Haydon, at Copacabana on the NSW Central Coast for $4.3m. 2GB’s Ben Fordham reportedly revealed the sale and says the prime minister exchanged contracts in September, with settlement expected before the end of October. Albanese had told Fordham: I’m about to get marred to Jodie and start a new chapter of our lives. Jodie’s a ‘coastie’ and spending time with her up there is awesome. It will be nice to be closer to her parents and her family one day. News.com.au reports that the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home was sold for $1.7m in 2017 and $4.65m in 2021 – on the market for almost a full year before Albanese bought it for more than $300,000 cheaper than what the current owners paid. In May, Albanese defended his decision to evict the tenant from a house he owns in Sydney, saying he has been “more than fair” as a landlord but his impending marriage means he wants to sell: Smart energy trial for parts of Illawarra The Albanese government has announced a smart energy trial in the NSW Illawarra to help boost household electrification. Backed by $5.4m in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), residents in the 2515 postcode will be able to apply for subsidies for a range of devices. A statement from energy minister, Chris Bowen, says energy-efficient electric appliances will be installed in participating homes in Austinmer, Clifton, Coledale, Scarborough, Thirroul and Wombarra, along with a smart energy management device to optimise energy use. Arena funding will help households buy heat pump hot water and space heating systems, plus batteries and other resources. The project aims to generate insights into consumer behaviour, attitudes and energy bill savings to inform how home electrification could be scaled across Australia. The MP for Cunningham, Alison Byrnes, said: I look forward to seeing this project provide valuable insights and data in how this model could be rolled out across communities, particularly our more vulnerable households in lower socioeconomic areas who would benefit greatly from reduced energy bills. Four flood rescues amid rapid onset storm in Sydney yesterday The NSW SES assistant commissioner, Colin Malone, says four flood rescues occurred yesterday, after people drove into floodwaters in Sydney. He spoke with ABC News Breakfast about the storms that lashed Sydney and eastern parts of the country yesterday, and said there were 118 incidents – with 330 volunteers working into the evening. This is normal as we head into the summer thunderstorm period. We’ve heard this morning on the news already that Sydney will have heavy rain this morning that will upset peak-hour traffic … Our message is no one’s life is worth the risk of driving through floodwater … Turn around, rethink it and prioritise your family and your own life before entering flood water. Residential rental increases will be capped at once per year, under changes being introduced through the New South Wales parliament today. The rule would cover renters under periodic and fixed-term leases, fixing a loophole in the law. The proposal is being put forward as part of the Labor government’s rental reform package, which also includes change to make it easier to keep pets in rentals and ending no grounds evictions. The better regulation minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said: Ensuring renters can only be hit with one rent increase a year will provide greater certainty and protection for renters regardless of whether their lease type changes. Police search bushland amid investigation into Wollongong woman who went missing three decades ago NSW police have searched bushland in the Illawarra as they investigate the suspicious disappearance of a Wollongong woman 30 years ago. Strike Force Athena was established in 2022 to re-established the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Pauline Sowry, also known by her married name of Pauline Lawrence. She was 49 years old when last seen by her family in the northern suburbs of Wollongong in December 1993. Her whereabouts remain unknown. A 2008 coronial inquest found she had died, most likely after an unconfirmed sighting in 1994. Police said that following new information, a bushland search recommenced in the Illawarra escarpment at Figtree, south of Wollongong, last week. Pauline’s son Jason Lawrence said it’s been incredibly difficult for the family not knowing what happened to their mother and sister. We’ve been robbed of not knowing my mother, I’ve been robbed of not seeing what I’ve become over the years, how strong I’ve been, my career, my children. I’ve been robbed of a mother and robbed of a grandmother to my children. I’ve been robbed of a normal life, I don’t wish it on anybody. It would be really good to get some closure and know that she didn’t leave us and something had happened. Will take ‘months, if not years’ for families to bounce back Continuing from our last post, the Foodbank Australia CEO, Brianna Casey, said families were making “unimaginable choices”. This is an alarming statistic that demonstrates just how desperate the situation has become for those who were once a lifeline suddenly finding themselves living pay to pay, watching every dollar and sadly, no longer in a position to extend help to loved ones and friends. We know it’s going to take months, if not years, for many families to bounce back. We will continue to wrap our arms around our communities for as long as it takes, doing our bit to help nutritious, culturally appropriate food get to as many struggling households as possible. More than half (53%) of food insecure households reported they are receiving food relief more often than a year ago. Food insecure households receiving help from friends and family has dropped significantly from 32% in 2023 to 25% in 2024. Highest rates of food insecurity for low-income earners since onset of cost-of-living crisis, Foodbank says Low-income households are enduring the highest rates of food insecurity since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis, according to the Foodbank Hunger Report 2024, released today. Now in its 11th year, the report from food relief organisation Foodbank surveyed 4,260 people and highlights the growing divide between those who are able to absorb or adapt to rising costs and those being left behind. More than 870,000 (48%) of Australia’s low-income households – earning less than $30,000 – are experiencing food insecurity. This is the highest rate since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis, up 5% on 2022. The report offers an insight into the state of hunger across the country and reveals more than half (59%) of all food insecure households are experiencing the most severe level of hardship, regularly skipping meals or going entire days without food. Single-parent households are the hardest hit with over two-thirds (69%) facing food insecurity and 41% of these also experiencing the severest form. The federal government has announced targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranian individuals it says is “contributing to Iran’s missile program.” A statement from the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Iran’s missile program “poses a material threat to regional and international security”, with the 1 October attack on Israel a “dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war.” The sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The Albanese government has now sanctioned 200-Iran linked individuals and entities, the statement said. Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilising actions. Tasmanian opposition weighs in after Ferguson resigns from cabinet Tasmania’s opposition leader, Dean Winter, has also been speaking with ABC News Breakfast this morning – after news the deputy premier has quit cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout. Winter was set to move the motion of no-confidence in Michael Ferguson when parliament sits today. Asked about comments from the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, that he is undermining the functioning of the state’s parliament, Winter responded: We’re holding ministers accountable when the premier of Tasmania refused to. This project – for people who don’t know – is $500m over budget, five years delayed. It’s a completely debacle. Someone needed to take responsibility. The premier [was] saying he wouldn’t do that, the parliament decided it would act and, at the last moment, the deputy premier resigned. Asked if Ferguson had paid too high a price, Winter said, “the price is being paid by Tasmania’s tourism and hospitality industry”, and that “he’s still on the backbench”. Greens senator on government plan to ban debit card fees Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking with ABC News Breakfast about the federal government plan to ban debit card fees and instruct the consumer watchdog to investigate excessive card costs. Hanson-Young said she doesn’t think the move “goes far enough”, and she worries the government is “squibbing it on credit cards.” This is only for debit cards. A lot of people are paying for their groceries and everyday items with their credit card and being slugged fees as well. I think we need to make sure it’s the bank that covers the cost of this, not the consumer and not the small businesses. She said the Greens would look at what the government is proposing in detail. Olivia Rodrigo falls through stage platform Gen Z popstar Olivia Rodrigo is halfway through the Australian leg of her tour, and made headlines overnight after falling at her Melbourne show. In a video posted to social media, Rodrigo can be seen falling through an open platform on the stage. She did not appear injured, getting right back up and saying: Oh my God, that was fun! I’m OK. Woah. Sometime’s there’s just a hole in the stage. That’s alright. OK. Where was I? Rodrigo performed four shows at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena – with last night being her fourth. She will perform at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena on 17, 18, 21, and 22 October. Australia has responded to calls to help the people of Myanmar suffering under its military junta and announced $9m in aid for food, water and shelter on top of education and health services. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, announced the package alongside Sean Turnell, who was a political prisoner of the junta for 650 days, as she launched his book about the situation in Myanmar in Canberra yesterday. At least 5,350 civilians had been killed and half the nation was living under the poverty line, primarily due to military violence since the 2021 coup, Senator Wong said. We are all appalled by the reports of widespread human rights abuses and atrocities. And happy Tuesday – many thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be with you for most of today’s blog. You can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s go. Slavery reparations not on the agenda for Chogm summit in Samoa The issue of reparations for slavery is not on the agenda for next week’s Commonwealth heads of government summit, and the UK is not considering paying up, Downing Street has said. We report today that the stance could put the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who will attend the gathering in Samoa along with Anthony Albanese and other heads of government of the 54-nation bloc, on a collision course with other countries. All three candidates to succeed Patricia Scotland as Chogm secretary general at the event have said they support reparations for countries affected by slavery and colonisation. Here’s the full report: HSC written exams start today A record number of students will be waking up with nerves in New South Wales this morning, with the formal written exam period to begin. More than 76,000 students will be sitting an HSC exam, to run over the next 19 days. In total, 124 exams will be sat, starting with English at 9.50am. Atars will then be delivered on Wednesday 18 December – with half of the mark derived from the exam period. The deputy premier and minister for education, Prue Car, advised students to “trust the hard work you’ve done”. All the best to the HSC class of 2024 – the largest high school cohort in the country and in NSW history – as you head into written exams. Thank you to all of the teachers who have been part of this cohort’s 13-year education. I know every teacher and parent is looking on with pride today as these young people take this big step in their educational journey. The NSW Education Standards Authority chief, Paul Martin, said the exam period would be a “huge logistical operation” for schools and staff. My message to students: there are many ways to reach your goals. Be passionate, be curious and feel confident in all that you have learned over the last 13 years. Tasmania’s minority Liberal government is again in crisis after the deputy premier quit cabinet over the bungled Bass Strait ferry rollout, AAP reports. Michael Ferguson was set to face a no-confidence motion in parliament today over delays and cost blowouts to the delivery of new $900m Spirit of Tasmania ships. That was set to carry, with crossbench MPs queuing up to back the Labor opposition. He instead bowed to the pressure last night by resigning as treasurer along with giving up his small business and consumer affairs portfolios. It is the latest headache for Jeremy Rockliff’s Liberals who were plunged into minority in May 2023 and called an early March election only to be returned in minority with a more diverse cross bench. New berths for the two Spirit vessels won’t be ready for their arrival in what the state Labor opposition has dubbed the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania’s history. Ferguson said in a statement: I want to thank my Liberal party colleagues for their continued support for me over the past 20 years – and during my time as a minister in cabinet. I want to thank the premier [Jeremy Rockliff] for his support and backing over the past few months – both personally and as a colleague – this friendship is one that I have returned to him during my time as his deputy premier. The Labor leader, Dean Winter, was set to move the no-confidence motion when parliament sits today. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then my colleague Emily Wind will take you through the main action. Our top story this morning is that Labor is launching another initiative to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australians by proposing to outlaw the charges we rack up when paying for things with debit cards. They will also instruct the consumer watchdog to investigate excessive card costs, as the transaction charges get set for an overhaul. The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, says in an exclusive interview with us today that he would rather see a minority Liberal National party government in power after the 26 October state election than horse-trade with independents and minor parties to share government. Miles faces a stiff task to overcome a big deficit in the polls to stay in power against the challenge from David Crisafulli’s LNP. Calls are mounting for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate business practices in the live music industry after an ABC Four Corners report scrutinising the Australian arm of the live entertainment behemoth Live Nation. Tasmania’s minority Liberal government will need to find a new deputy premier and treasurer after the state’s second-in-charge resigned amid a Bass Strait ferry fiasco. Michael Ferguson quit cabinet last night after being confronted with the prospect of losing a no-confidence vote in parliament today. More coming up."

                    "bodyText": "A late update: here are some photos from the post-summit drinks reception at St Paul’s Cathedral: Time for a recap. Investors attending the Labour government’s first International Investment Summit have announced pledges totalling £63bn today, which will create an estimated 38,000 jobs. Spending commitments include £20bn from ‘Vampire kangaroo’ Macquarie, on projects including a rollout of fast-charging electric vehicle infrastructure at motorway service stations, over £6bn of new data centres by US tech firms, an expansion of Stansted airport, and a tie-up with US pharma firm Eli Lilly. Jackie Wild, CEO of international technical construction group TSL (which is building Google’s £800m data centre in Hertfordshire) welcomed the pledge for more data centre investment, but warned that planning reform is needed, saying: “It’s encouraging to see the Government facilitating investment in digital infrastructure, including data centres, which will underpin the fourth industrial revolution and stimulate growth in the UK for decades to come. However, it is essential that international businesses have confidence in Britain’s capability to deliver the physical infrastructure to back investment. Businesses like Google, Amazon and Cyrus One are prospering here but it’s important that we now see swift progress on issues like planning reform to facilitate expansion and increased investment from businesses of their profile.” The government also secured a £1bn expansion of London Gateway port, after the row over transport secretary Louise Haigh’s criticism of its owner’s poor business practices was defused. Opening the event, Sir Keir Starmer said the government and investors were bound together, in the “shared endeavour of prosperity”. Growth, Starmer argued, was “vital…if we are to steer our way through a great period of insecurity and change”. Having ‘celebrated’ 100 days in office on Saturday, Starmer pledged to fix the UK’s public service and stabilise the economy quickly, and also repair Britain’s brand “as an open, outward-looking, confident, trading nation”. In comments that have caused alarm, Starmer pledged to “get rid” of regulations that are holding back investment, such as building homes, data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, and trainlines. Both the Green Party and the RSPB have voiced concerns about what this will mean for Britain. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, told delegates that UK corporation tax would be capped at 25% for the lifetime of this parliament, in an attempt to give bosses some certainty. She also warned that the government faces ‘difficult choices’ as she draws up the budget, and hinted that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions…. Reeves also announced that the UK Infrastructure Bank has been converted into the National Wealth Fund, which will be capitalised with £27.8bn to catalyse private investment in the market. The Financial Times has calculated that Reeves has cut by a fifth the new money she is investing into the UK’s National Wealth Fund, though – from the £7.3bn originally pledged to just £5.8bn. Rachel Reeves has dropped her strongest hint yet that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions in the budget, prompting accusations Labour is about to break its manifesto promises. The chancellor used the government’s international investment summit at Guildhall in London on Monday to warn of tax rises to come in this month’s announcement, insisting that business would understand the need for fiscal stability. After days of rumours that Reeves is planning to impose national insurance on employers’ pension contributions, the chancellor refused to rule out doing so, adding that executives would understand the need for such decisions. Speaking at the investment summit today, Reeves said: “We will stick to the commitments we made in our manifesto. But you know there is a £22bn black hole over and above anything we knew about going into the election that we need to fill, and that’s not just a one year, that persists throughout the forecast period. “So we are going to need to sort of close that gap between what government is spending and bringing in through tax receipts. But we are going to be a government that sticks to our manifesto commitments, including that one [on not raising taxes on working people].” However…Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Times Radio today that such a move would count as a “straightforward breach” of the manifesto. He said: “I went back and read the manifesto and it says very clearly, we will not raise rates of national insurance.” Reeves’s predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, agrees… (I think “Ling” should be “King”) Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, isn’t surprised to hear that the government raised a record amount of new investment today. She points out: “There was simply no way the government’s much touted summit could end without a flurry of announcements promising billions of pounds in investment. The figure of £63 billion made for a rousing crescendo to a day of optimistic rhetoric and political promises but it was impossible for all those suited and booted business leaders to ignore the elephant in the room. “Rachel Reeves might have promised that a road map for business taxation will be set out but speculation about where that road will bend can be costly. Shares in gambling companies plummeted today as investors mulled over a potential doubling of taxes, and with the Budget still more than two weeks away confidence is fraying and businesses are crying out for the clarity and stability they’ve been promised. As the dust settles at Guildhall, delegates are heading off to St Paul’s Cathedral for a drinks reception with The King, where they should be entertained by Elton John. Here’s a breakdown of the investments announced today: Data centres Global tech firms announced investments worth £6.3bn in UK data centres – which ministers view as critical to enhancing the UK’s capacity in artificial intelligence. This includes the firms CyrusOne, ServiceNow, Cloud HQ and CoreWeave making plans to open locations in the UK, including a £1.9bn data centre campus at Didcot in Oxfordshire. Blackstone confirmed a £10bn investment in Blyth, Northumberland to create one of the largest artificial data centres in Europe, creating 4,000 jobs. Amazon Web Services announced a £8bn investment last month. Carbon capture and storage Announced in the run-up to the summit, as much as £21.7bn of funding will be spread over 25 years in investment from the public sector. Ministers expect this to leverage in £8bn of private sector investment from companies including BP and Equinor. The plans will fund two carbon capture sights; one in the north west of England on Merseyside, and another in the north east, on Teesside – directly creating 4,000 jobs and supporting 50,000 jobs in the long-term. Clean energy Days before the summit ministers announced investment by the private sector in clean energy. This included the Spanish firm Iberdrola doubling its investment in the UK, through Scottish Power, from £12bn to £24bn over the next 4 years. Orsted and Greenvolt will invest after the government’s recently expanded offshore wind auction, with the business department expecting this to unlock £8bn in private investment from Orsted and £2.5bn from Greenvolt. Octopus Energy have committed to a £2bn investment in renewable energy generation, including four new solar farms in Bristol, Essex, East Riding of Yorkshire and Wiltshire. Macquarie, the Australian investment firm – which previously owned Thames Water – will supporting investment of £1.3bn investment into new green infrastructure, including its Island Green Power solar farm in Stow. Infrastructure DP World are investing up to £1bn in their London Gateway container port operation, after a controversial row with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh. The new investment will fund two additional berths and a second rail terminal. Manchester Airports Group is investing more than £1.1bn in London Stansted Airport. Network Rail and London &amp; Continental Railways are creating a new property company to regenerate brownfield sites across the rail estate, with a value exceeding £1bn. Public investment Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced an expansion of Labour’s flagship National Wealth Fund, involving a merger of the organisation with the existing UK Infrastructure Bank set up by the previous Conservative government. With a total of £27.8bn, the combined entity will be based in Leeds, and have the aim to provide public money to “catalyse private investment” into the UK’s clean energy and growth industries – including green hydrogen, carbon capture and gigafactories. The British Business Bank (BBB) will also have an expanded role, through a programme branded the “British Growth Partnership,” that will raise hundreds of millions of pounds of private money to invest in commercial projects. Ministers say the funding will be allocated “independently of government on a fully commercial basis”. This new money will be in addition to £3.5bn of support provided by the BBB to more than 23,000 businesses last year. Katie White, MP for Leeds North West, has welcomed today’s announcement that the National Wealth Fund will be headquartered in the city. White, who called for this to happen in the Yorkshire Post last week, says: “I’m thrilled that the Chancellor has confirmed the National Wealth Fund will be based in Leeds—the green finance capital of the UK. This is fantastic news for Leeds, the North, and the entire country. Private investment is crucial for driving the UK’s green transition. With Leeds already home to the UK Infrastructure Bank, leading investment to achieve net zero, and the growing presence of the Bank of England here, our city has proven it has the expertise and ambition to develop and invest in the industries of the future. The National Wealth Fund will create thousands of clean energy jobs, boost energy security, and contribute to tackling climate change. By working at pace with industry, the Government will unlock private investment and strengthen the economy.” The government has now announced the grand total of investment pledged at today’s summit, in a fashion reminiscent of Children In Need (no Pudsey Bear, though, alas). And ….. confirming Rachel Reeves’s comments in her speech a few minutes ago, they say the summit has secured £63bn of investment and almost 38,000 jobs. It’s wise to be a little cynical about such claims – often, companies simply bundle up plans they were drawing up anyway. But the government are very keen to trumpet today’s event as a triumph, pointing out that they’ve secured twice as much as Rishi Sunak managed at his final investment summit in November 2023 (when there was rather more political uncertainty flowing around). Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says: “Global investors should be in no doubt that under this new government Britain is truly the best place to do business. The record-breaking investment total secured at today’s Summit marks a major vote of confidence in the UK and our stability dividend across industry and innovation. We’re determined to deliver economic growth in every part of the UK and these investments, together with our forthcoming Industrial Strategy, will give global businesses the certainty they need as we lead the charge for the innovation and jobs of the future.” The new government has put unlocking private investment at the heart of everything we do,, Reeves says. Returning to the £60bn of investment announced at (or slightly before) the summit, Reeves says those pledges will mean new, high-skilled jobs, from Aberdeenshire in Scotland to Blyth in Northumberland, and to North Wales. She concludes: The decisions that lie ahead will not always be easy, but by making the right choices – to grow our economy, drive investment, we will create good jobs and new opportunities across every part of our country. That is the Britain that we are building, and that is the difference that we will make together. And with that, the chancellor leaves the stage, to a warm round of applause. Rachel Reeves then announces that the UK’s new National Wealth Fund had been created. It will be the UK”s new ‘impact investor’, she says, catalysing tens of billions of private investment to fund green technology. Reeves says the UK Infrastructure Bank will now operate as the National Wealth Fund, headquartered in Leeds, with a bigger team, more freedom, and more risk capital to invest. Business taxation is a critical part of the government’s growth plan, Reeves continues. Constant changes in corporation tax in recent years have caused instability, she says, so the government will produce a corporation tax roadmap. That will mean a cap on corporation tax at 25% (its current level) for this parliament (a pledge Labour already made back in February), and a ‘world-leading’ capital allowances offer, including ‘full expensing’ [which allows firms to offset investment costs against their tax bill.] I will deliver a balanced approach in the budget, Rachel Reeves pledges. That means: Fiscal and economic stability, investment over decline, in a budget that will protect living standards, repair our NHS and fix the foundations of our economy so we can build a stronger Britain. Moving onto her budget later this month, Rachel Reeves says the government faces “difficult choices” due to the situation it has inherited. The first step is to restore fiscal and economic stability, Reeves says. Defending her first fiscal rule, to move the current budget into balance, she says: Balancing the books by ensuring we do no borrow for day-to-day spending is not anti-investment. It’s the only way to ensure government and business can invest with confidence. Government investment must be sustainable, she adds, with debt falling at the end of the forecast (this is the second fiscal rule). It must also “crowd in” private investment too, she adds. Rachel Reeves declares the government is ending years of instability and uncertainty, and bringing jobs back to this country. She adds: Britain is open for business once again. Reeves adds that reforming the UK pension system will release more funds for investment. Rachel Reeves says the government want to be the most pro-business government the UK has ever seen. To do that, she says, government and business must work hand in hand, the chancellor says. She cites the government’s plan to remove blockages in the planning system, and end the ban on onshore wind. Back at the Guildhall, chancellor Rachel Reeves is delivering a closing keynote address to delegates at the investment summit. Reeves begins by saying how fantastic it is to be at the Guildhall after such a “brilliant day”. She says her optimism for Britain “burns brighter than ever”, after £60bn of shovel-ready investment was announced today. Those commitments, from companies such as Servicenow, Eli Lilly and the Manchester Airport Group, will help create over 40,000 jobs in the UK, Reeves says. That is a sign of the confidence that we now see in the UK economy, she says, and will help big and small businesses across the UK. That £60bn includes £20bn from Macquarie Group for a range of projects, and – I assume – the £24bn of green technology investment announced last Friday (three days before the summit)… Keir Starmer has also told Bloomberg TV that suggestions the UK government was considering raising capital gains tax as high as 39% was “wide of the mark.” Speaking at the investment summit, the PM said: “A lot of speculation is getting pretty wide of the mark,” Asked whether chancellor Rachel Reeves could hike capital gains tax to 39% from a top rate of 28% currently, Starmer replied: “That’s getting to an area which is wide of the mark.” The Guardian reported last week that Treasury officials have been testing a range of 33% to 39% for capital gains tax (CGT), as the government tries to raise funds for public services. The Royal Social for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has described Keir Starmer’s speech this morning, in which he said he wanted to “rip out” planning laws blocking growth as “unsettling”, my colleague Andrew Sparrow reports. Echoing earlier concerns from the Green Party, RSPB chief executive, Beccy Speight, says: An unsettling speech from the PM this morning for those who love and value nature. Deregulation done in the wrong way is effectively dropping standards, at a time when the natural world desperately needs better protection. It’s a short-sighted tactic that could have ramifications for us all in years to come, undermining our long term prosperity - better methods, such as nature-friendly planning, would give businesses the certainty they need. We support growth and we support the badly-needed energy transition, but not at the expense of our precious wildlife and wild places. His very own secretary of state [Steve Reed] said recently that “nature is dying” – uncontrolled deregulation is tantamount to hammering the final nail into its coffin. That’s from the Politics Live blog: Keir Starmer has told Bloomberg TV that he wants to bring in more investment, as the UK “desperately needs growth”. The PM says: We haven’t had meaningful growth in the economy in the United Kingdom in 14 long years. We’re determined to turn that around. Q: Would the governmen need to be sure that Chinese retailer Shein wasn’t using forced labour in Xinjiang, before you allowed them to float on the London stock market? Starmer won’t comment on individual cases, but talks about the need for high standards, particularly for workers. And in a hint that all companies looking to sell shares in London will face scrutiny over workers’ rights, Starmer says: “Of course we’ll be looking at any issue…with a particular feature on the rights of the workforce.” Britain’s competition watchdog has pushed back against some implied criticism from the prime minister today. In his speech this morning, Keir Starmer told international investors he’d ensure that the UK’s economic and competition regulators “take growth as seriously as this room does”. The Competitions and Markets Authority has now rebuffed the implication that it is neglecting growth. A CMA spokesperson has told the Guardian: “Driving growth and innovation has been an explicit strategic priority for the CMA over the last two years. It continues to be a focus for the work we are doing.” Australia’s Macquarie Group have announced a £20bn package of investment in the UK today. Attending the investment summit, Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake announced the company will help fund a network of fast-charging electric vehicle infrastructure in the UK. The investment will see Macquarie’s portfolio company Roadchef install around 650 fast-charging points at its motorway service area sites. Macquarie (often criticised for its management of Thames Water) says the upgraded EV charging facilities will be partly powered by 9 MW of new solar energy capacity installed on-site. Roadchef will also test electric charging solutions for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) at two key locations across the motorway network. Wikramanayake (who we saw earlier today) says: “The upgrade of Roadchef sites is our latest in a long line of investments in UK infrastructure and we have plans to invest more. We believe that infrastructure investment helps create strong foundations for economic growth, job creation, better services for the public and stronger communities. We are fully invested in the UK’s success and look forward to playing our part in delivering the investment the country needs.” Macquarie is also planning to invest in: 5GW of new offshore wind developments, including projects off the Orkney and Lincolnshire coasts Developing new solar power and battery energy storage projects, including the UK’s largest new solar project in Nottinghamshire by Island Green Power Supporting investment in the gas transmission network, including upgrades to the distribution networks in North West England, West Midlands, East Midlands, East of England and London Upgrading digital infrastructure, including bringing ultra-fast full fibre and gigabit wireless broadband to rural communities from Somerset to Cumbria Investing in the creation of new homes, including developments in Edinburgh and Birmingham Supporting the growth of high potential UK companies in areas such as utilities connections, wind farm performance analytics and smart metering led from Glasgow, Nottingham, and Watford Supporting investment to build the UK’s first reservoir in 30 years [in Havant, Hampshire] alongside upgrades to essential water and wastewater infrastructure across England’s South East Green Party MP for North Herefordshire, Ellie Chowns, has criticised Keir Starmer’s pledge to rip up bureaucracy to get growth moving. Following his speech at the investment summit, Chowns says: “Starmer’s pledge to investors that he will “cut red tape” is a tired cliché that, in practice, too often means harming environmental standards and workers’ rights. We’ve had fourteen years of successive Conservative governments promising to “cut red tape,” and all we have to show for it is a flatlining economy and falling living standards. If Starmer is serious about attracting investment to the UK, he will need a bolder approach that delivers on the “change” he promised in his election campaign. He could start by re-evaluating our relationship with our biggest trading partner, the European Union.” Secretary of State for Transport Louise Haigh has resisted talking about the row over her criticism of P&amp;O Ferries and their owner DP World, The Sun’s Ashley Armstrong reports: As reported earlier, DP World are attending the summit, and have announced a £1bn expansion of its London Gateway container port. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is hoping that the Labour governmnet will agree closer alignment with the European Union, and isn’t ruling out an eventual return to the single market. Speaking at the Government’s international investment summit, he told the PA news agency: “I’m quite clear that all successful countries do the most trade with their nearest neighbours, that’s one of the signs of success. We’ve got on our doorstep, not just friends and colleagues and family indeed, we’ve got a market of more than 500 million people. The good news is the Prime Minister spent a lot of the last three months visiting friends in Europe, whether it’s the president of France, the prime minister of Italy, the chancellor of Germany or the European Union, indeed, in Brussels. The current Brexit deal we have comes up before review next year. I’m hoping, unlike last time, there will be closer alignment, rather than divergence. We should be looking at a whole host of issues and talking about them – whether it’s a youth mobility scheme, whether it’s seeing what we can do to bring people closer together. I think the reality is, in the short term, we probably aren’t going to get back as members of the single market. But it’s something we shouldn’t be scared to talk about.” Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of the London-based investment giant M&amp;G, says global investors are looking at Britain differently under a Labour government. Speaking at the investment summit, Rossi told my colleague Richard Partington: “The last years have suffered a little bit, you know, Brexit, Covid, and instability. There is to a certain extent a renaissance of the UK, as people are looking at the UK again. Not only local investors but international investors.” With more than £100bn invested in the UK already, M&amp;G is one of the headline sponsors of the event, and is clearly in tune with the message the government wants to send. Rossi says he has held meetings with ministers throughout the day who all “speak the same language” on the priority of economic growth. “The alignment [between them], that relentless focus on growth. That is what is attracting people.” Rossi says M&amp;G is keen to see progress on reducing burdensome regulation, particularly in the planning system, but that he is also full-square behind the government’s employment rights reforms and the need to maintain some regulations to ensure a sustainable economy. He says: “If you want to have sustainable growth you need to make sure you take care of the most important stakeholders. Who are the most important stakeholders? It’s the people working.” However, he warned against Rachel Reeves announcing large tax increases in the budget in two weeks’ time, saying: “You’re not going to grow the economy if you tax the economy much, much more. Because then you’re killing the economy. You might have a short-term benefit but long-term there’s no benefit at all.” Asked about the suggestions that the chancellor could raise capital gains tax, Rossi said: “I cannot speculate on what she will do. But I’m sure that they will balance very well, whatever they do, with their ultimate ambition of growing the economy. And I’m convinced they’ll be very pragmatic about it.” In a further attempt to woo international investors, the UK has launched a consultation into its new industrial strategy, dubbed Invest 2035. The foreword of the strategy begins by declaring “Growth is the number one mission of this government” – which we’ve already heard from Keir Starmer today. The government says its industrial Strategy will be “ambitious and targeted”, saying. Its primary objective is to drive growth, by taking advantage of the UK’s unique strengths and untapped potential, enabling the UK’s world-leading sectors to adapt and grow, and seizing opportunities to lead in new sectors, with high quality, well-paid jobs. It will shape the type of growth being pursued: the Government will also seek to support Net Zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience. It will be grounded in long-term stability, a renewed commitment to free and fair trade, and a pro-business approach focused on reducing barriers to investment in the UK. And as expectred, it foguses on eight growth-driving sectors: Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Creative Industries, Defence, Digital and Technologies, Financial Services, Life Sciences, and Professional and Business Services. But there’s very little about migration – an issue which Eric Schmidt identified as crucial earlier today. The document says: Our people are supported by an immigration system that attracts the brightest and best, with the UK being the second most attractive country in the G20 for young people. Sam Coates of Sky News has whizzed through the document, and plucked out the key points: It’s nearly as busy outside the Guildhall as inside, with a second group of protestors holding a demonstration. Campaigners opposed to the Sizewell C nuclear plant unfurled two banners saying “Sizewell C is a Toxic Investment” this morning outside the investment summit. They hope to persuade international investors not to support the project. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C says: “It’s fantastic that Britain is open for business, but we’re here to tell international investors that, unless they want to find themselves embroiled in another HS2, they should put their money into renewables instead of slow, risky, expensive, “toxic” Sizewell C. The reality is that Sizewell C cannot help the Labour government achieve its Energy Mission, and if UK investors won’t touch it, neither should international ones, nor the taxpayer.” The ‘Final Investment Decision’ (FID) on the proposed plant on the Suffolk Coast has already been delayed. Yesterday, the GMB and Unite unions urged the government to sign off the investment quickly. Australian investment bank Macquarie is also attending today’s investment summit, despite having been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England’s water industry. Shemara Wikramanayake, Macquarie’s CEO is there, and was seated next to chancellor Rachel Reeves… …and also appears to have been chatting to Pat McFadden, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: Last year Wikramanayake insisted that the investment bank’s UK nickname, the “vampire kangaroo”, was disappointing, after it piled debt onto Thames Water which is now close to collapse. Climate campaigners are unimpressed by today’s announcement of more investment for Stansted airport (see earlier post). Alethea Warrington, head of aviation, heat, and energy at climate charity Possible, says: “Expanding airports to encourage even more flights is the last thing we need if we’re going to tackle the climate crisis. “Instead of allowing high-carbon sectors such as aviation to expand, the government should rein in aviation growth by banning private jets and taxing frequent flyers, and focus on supporting investment in clean, low carbon technologies and climate-friendly transport.” Larry Fink is one of the most powerful investors at today’s summit; on Friday, his asset manager BlackRock reported that it now holds assets of $11.5 trillion. He’s been meeting ministers this morning, including deputy PM Angela Raynor: And chancellor Rachel Reeves: While the cream of global investing hobnob inside the Guildhall, outside there are protesters calling for a wealth tax to fund investment. Youth climate justice campaign group Green New Deal Rising are displaying a banner reading “Tax Extreme Wealth”, as they urge Rachel Reeves to target the wealthiest in this month’s budget. Fatima Ibrahim, co-director of Green New Deal Rising, says: “Private investment alone will not fix our economy - and it certainly won’t rescue our public services or tackle the climate crisis. Instead of taking freebies from the super-rich and abdicating responsibility to the private sector, which has polluted our water and ruined our railways, it’s time for Rachel Reeves to make the common-sense, popular choice to end the unfairness in our tax system. She must choose to tax extreme wealth by implementing an annual 2% tax on assets over 10 million in the Autumn Budget. Doing so would unlock billions for urgently needed public investment to benefit our communities, not just wealthy shareholders”. Labour is pulling out all the stops for its international investment summit. Business leaders gathered in the City of London have just been told Sir Elton John will be performing tonight at an ultra-exclusive dinner reception at St Paul’s Cathedral, where King Charles will be in attendance. The dinner will include dining courtesy of the three-Michelin-starred-chef Clare Smyth, at an event with the cabinet, where one Labour staffer said there had been “fights” over who would get to attend because of the very limited capacity for company bosses. Sir Lucian Grainge, the chair of Universal Music Group, confirmed that the Rocket man would be performing this evening, while speaking on a panel session with the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, on the “UK’s soft power as a hard investment opportunity”. “He’s an ambassador. He wanted to be here,” says Grainge, to applause and whoops from some of the big beasts of capitalism attending the event at the Guildhall in the City of London. “I wish you could see the politicians’ faces. We spend a lot of time in meetings, we don’t get out very often,” Nandy replied. Perhaps, but would it be unfair to suggest that Labour politicians have been in hot water of late for taking freebies to attend superstar gigs? The panel session, involving Gareth Southgate, the former England manager, and the head of production at Netflix, Anna Mallet, highlighted how Britain punches above its weight for cultural capital. Southgate talked up changes to kick-off times in the Premier League as a key for attracting TV money into England’s national sport. “A lot of people didn’t like,” he says, but it brought the “ability to bring in best talent. The best players wanted to come here, and the product improved.” Grainge warned the UK was “at a crossroads” in the market for culture, as new technologies helped the rise of talent around the world - including Latin America, India and China (a country where he says it was an “entirely counterfeit market” 20 years ago but is now the seventh biggest in the world). Saying he is spending more time in the UK recently, as a market where Universal will invest, he adds: “The advantage for the UK, about the UK as an investment, is that it has as the prime minister keeps repeating, is the rule of law, a non-politicised justice system, and it respects and rewards for investment and innovation and creativity around copyright and IP.” A group of US tech firms have announced they will invest over £6bn in UK data centres. ServiceNow, CyrusOne, CloudHQ and CoreWeave would invest a combined £6.3bn in UK data centre technology, the government says at today’s investment summit. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle calls the move a ‘vote of confidence’ in Britain, which will take the total investment in UK data centres to over £25bn since the government took office in July. CloudHQ is set to develop a new £1.9bn data centre campus in Didcot, Oxfordshire. Kyle says: Tech leaders from all over the world are seeing Britain as the best place to invest with a thriving and stable market for data centres and AI development. Data centres power our day-to-day lives and boost innovation in growing sectors like AI. This is why only last month, I took steps to class UK data centres as Critical National Infrastructure giving the industry the ultimate reassurance the UK will always be a safe home for their investment. Today’s drumbeat of investment is a vote of confidence in Britain and our approach to work with business to deliver sustained growth for all. The government has also announced a “landmark collaboration” with pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly, worth £279m, to accelerate the delivery of next-generation medicines. Eli Lilly has expressed an intention to invest in the UK, as part of a collaborative partnership with the government announced at the International Investment Summit today. Eli Lilly plans to launch the first ‘Lilly Gateway Labs’ innovation accelerator in Europe. It will support early-stage life sciences businesses, by providing them with lab space, mentorship, and potential financial backing. Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting, says: “For all the challenges facing the health of our nation, we have two huge advantages: some of the world’s leading scientific minds, and a National Health Service with enormous potential. If we can combine the two, patients in this country can reap the rewards of the revolution in medical science unfolding before our eyes. “This announcement helps the UK take its place as a world leader in life sciences and brings life-changing treatments closer to being a reality for NHS patients. Partnerships like this are key to building a healthier society, healthier economy, and making the NHS fit for the future.” The collaboration intends to explore new ways of delivering health and care services to people living with obesity, the government adds. Eli Lilly makes an anti-obesity drug called Zepbound in the US, or Mounjaro in the UK. Last week, the NHS said it would offer Mounjaro to nearly a quarter million people as part of a three-year plan. A five-year, £1.1bn investment to grow London Stansted has been unveiled by the Prime Minister at the International Investment Summit. Just over half the money, some £600m, will go on previously announced plans to expand the airport’s terminal by a third, as it grows its capacity from 29m passengers to 43m per year. Another £500m will be spent on other enhancements to the existing terminal and to the wider airport, notably a 14.3MW on-site solar farm to support Stansted’s increasing electricity demands, including its new EV charging forecourt. Construction is expected to begin next year and take two to three years to complete. Planning permission for expansion was granted last year, but the cost of the overhaul has not previously been released – and with owning group MAG being one-third owned by overseas investors IFM (if mainly by Manchester councils) the announcement brings an element of foreign money to the UK. Transport secretary Louise Haigh said: “Transport is central to this government’s core mission of growing the economy. This is about giving companies like MAG the confidence to invest, boosting regional and national economic growth, and supporting the aviation sector while also meeting our existing environmental obligations.” Ken O’Toole, CEO of MAG - which owns Manchester and East Midlands Airports as well as Stansted, said: “Aviation is an essential enabler of the success of the UK’s key high-value industries, and we look forward to helping the government achieve the highest sustained growth in the G7 through the sustainable growth of our airports.” Speaking of Nobel prizes… two UK-born academics are among a trio of US-based professors who have just won this year’s Nobel prize in economics, for showing how the types of institutions introduced by colonisers have helped determine whether a country is rich or poor today. The explanation put forward by Turkish-American Daron Acemoğlu, Sheffield-born Simon Johnson and Briton James A Robinson, suggests that inclusive institutions for the long-term benefit of European migrants ended up resulting in more prosperous societies in the long term. However, they found that in countries where the aim was to exploit the Indigenous population and extract resources for the colonisers’ benefit, the impact has been detrimental, and resulted in far poorer societies, leaving some countries trapped in low economic growth cycles. Q: How can British companies attract the talent it needs for the artificial intelligence revolution? Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says: A pro-growth agenda would start with high-skilled immigration, which is now in place here and should be expanded. Schmidt points out that a lot of “incredibly smart people” are now getting graduate degrees in AI. The key, he says, is either to keep them in Britain or get them to move here from Europe. Schmidt agrees that more AI talent is needed, as the technology is hard, complicated, and it’s being built right now. He admits: Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to me, and I have a PhD in the area. But with a little bit of time, and the right leadership., Britian can have all those people. Schmidt points out: They love living here. A good moment to wrap up the session. Q: How can the UK win the battle for AI talent? Keir Starmer argues that Britain is in a good position now, in the top three in the world for artificial intelligence thanks to world-leading universities. He agrees that the UK needs to attract top talent. Making it clear that AI matters to the UK should help the country hold its leading position, he says. Former chief Eric Schmidt then fires a warning to Keir Starmer that Britain risks missing out on the move to data centres, which are notoriously energy-thirsty. Schmidt tells Starmer, on the stage at the investment summit: The demand for energy for data centres is massive. We need you to approve the necessary steps to make these data centres in Britain, because your research scientists, your companies, your citizens all need these things. Schmidt argues that investing heavily in AI will pay off, by finding ways to improve energy efficiency – finding the solutions to the energy transition faster. GSK chief Emma Walmsley turns to the health service… Keir Starmer says the UK is “rightly proud” of the NHS, set up by Labour over 70 years ago. The simple truth is that simply putting more money into the health services as it is won’t make it fit for the future. The PM insists he’s not talking about changing the principle of healthcare being free at the point of use. Instead, he says there is huge potential for AI to improve the delivery of public services, such as health care. He cites technology using AI to scan for liver cancer – which he’s seen, and which massively improves the chance of spotting the disease early. Eric Schmidt backs up this point, saying computer vision is now more accurate than human vision, so can do a better job of spotting early signs of illness. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt tells the summit that the Science Museum down the road shows how the industrial age was invented here in the UK. There’s every reason to think that artificial intelligence will have the same level of impact. And by the way, it was invented right here too, in particular in Kings Cross, which I think is.. “My constituency”, says Keir Starmer proudly, pointing out that Demis Hassabis winning the Nobel prize last week was “absolutely amazing”. I said to him yesterday, I feel proud, he should. Schmidt then eulogises about AI, arguing that AI will make everyone at least twice as productive. That means Starmer can make twice as many speeches… …The PM suggests this might not be popular, winning some laughs in the room… while a firm such as GSK can make incredible life-saving drugs twice as quickly. The key to AI is efficiency gains, Schmidt adds, which will lead to a massive wave of investment and higher incomes for people. Schmidt points out that last year the UK laid out the core structure of AI safety (under Starmer’s predecessor, Rishi Sunak). He says Britain is in a good position to take the lead on AI, as: The UK has frankly stronger civil servants, who are smarter and more committed to this, and are frankly stable, so you can work with them. There’s every reason the UK can build the AI world, and also help deal with the ‘guardrail’ issue, Schmidt adds. GSK CEO Dame Emma Walmsley then asks: Q: Where does Britain sit in a global setting, post-Brexit? Starmer says that the Brexit vote gave the impression that Britain was turning in on itself, and less interested in the outside world. The PM says he’s been focused on resetting the UK’s international relations, to make it clear that we want to play our old role on the world stage, as a “confident, outward-looking, value-driven” country that sticks to agreements it makes. Sat alongside Starmer, former Google chief Eric Schmidt says he was “shocked” when Labour became strongly in favour of growth. Taking his chance, Starmer chirps up with: Wealth creation is the number one mission of a Labour government… It’s true. Schmidt says he knows Starmer believes this. Having spoken with investors at the summit in recent days, Schmidt has good news for Starmer, saying: There’s plenty of money that’s going to come into the country if you achieve what you’re just said. Schmidt suggests the government needs a minister of “anti-regulation”. But the bad news, he argues, is that in the UK system there are “so many ways that people can say no”. Businesses would rather have a single person who can give a yes or no answer. Schmidt warns Starmer that Labour’s goal of making Britain a clean energy superpower by the end of the decade is at risk, saying: The cost of capital and the delay is killing you. And furthermore, you’re not going to achieve your 2030 energy goal – which is laudable – without fixing this. Starmer is now holding an “in conversation” event with former CEO and chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, moderated by the CEO of GSK Dame Emma Walmsley Walmsley starts by asking about competitiveness, saying: Q: How will we make sure that the costs of doing business in Britain, and the regulatory environment, are competitive, compared to the G7 and the rest of Europe? And taking a long-term view, what do you most want to achieve for businesses on your watch to encourage them to bet on Britain? Starmer starts by criticising the ‘sticking plaster’ politics of the previous government, saying he is leading a mission-driven government – and the number one mission is economic growth. That provides a ‘yardstick’ for taking decisions. Secondly, he again cites Labour’s chunky majority in parliament – meaning there is stability, decisions taking today can be measured in ‘years, not months’, and there’s power to take difficult decisions. He says he wants to champion the brilliance of the UK economy, and remove the ‘inhibitors’ such as planning. It takes far too long to get decisions on planning, measure in years not months. We’ve got to streamline that, and we’ve already started. On regulation, Starmer says the ‘volume’ of regulation, and the number of regulators “pulling away” at issues, is a problem that needs to be stripped away. He also cites the appointment of ex-Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson as UK investment minister, last week (just in time for the summit). Starmer adds that he wants a partnership between a ‘mission-driven government’ and the private sector. That means working together, where the government can clear the path to help companies succeed. As flagged this morning, Starmer then pledges to “look at regulation”, and remove rules that are holding back investment. The PM says: “Where it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, the warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it…. then mark my words, we will get rid of it. He cites the example of the East Anglia Two windfarm, where regulators demanded 4,000 documents (not simply pages) when assessing the proposal…. Once it was finally signed off, it was held up by other two years by a judicial review. That will deter investors from the UK, Starmer says, adding: It’s time to upgrade the regulators’ regime, and make it fit for the modern age. Starmer says the government will “march” through the regulators, and makes sure they take growth as seriously as the investors in the room today. The door is open for business leaders to voice concerns to Starmer and his team, the PM adds. He concludes: It’s time to back Britain. Keir Starmer then tells international investors they shouldn’t be worried about Labour’s employment rights bill, introduced last week. Let me be clear, they are “pro-growth”, Starmer insists. Workers with more security at work, with higher wages, is a better growth model for this country, he points out, and will bring much-needed dynamism to the economy. Starmer then runs through four crucial areas for his plan (admitting that CEOs prefer lists of three, not four) 1) Stability. He says there is a ‘golden opportunity’ to end the era of chop and change, citing his large majority won in July. 2) Strategy. Building a ‘more strategic architecture’ for growth, including the creation of a national wealth fund and Great British Energy, and the recent pledge to fund carbon capture and storage projects. Starmer says his government is not in the business of picking individual winners, but ti does want to build on its strengths. Verging into sporting metaphors, he says he wants to make UK businesses match-fit, by: Mowing the grass on the pitch, making sure the changing rooms are clear and comfortable, the training ground is good. The new industrial strategy is fundamental to the plan, Starmer says. 3) Britain’s global standing. Starmer says “We’re determined to repair Britain’s brand as an open, outward-looking, trading nation”, so people know it’s a stable, trusted, rule-abiding partner. Starmer says that somehow, in “the circus after Brexit”, the last government “needlessly insulted our closest allies”. There were also a few “choice Anglo-Saxon phrases for businesses”, Starmer reminds his audience (a reference to Boris Johnson’s notorious “fuck business” retort to employer concerns about a hard Brexit). 4) Regulation. Starmer says he doesn’t see it as good or bad, that’s “simplistic”. He points out that the tragedy at Grenfell Tower showed the importance of regulations. But he accuses the previous government of hiding behind regulators, and deferring decisions to them because it was weak or indecisive, or just not committed to growth. Starmer then points out that the UK has problems too. The public sectors need urgent care, while the public finances need the ‘tough love’ of prudence (chanelling Gordon Brown there). We will fix the public services and stabilise the economy, quickly, he promises. We don’t want any of the problems associated with our inheritance misting up the shop window of Britain. Starmer turns to the issue of stability, saying “It’s not just that stability leads to growth, though we all recognise that. It’s also that growth leads to stability. Growth leads to a country that’s better equipped to come together and get its future back. And that’s why it’s always been so critical to my political project. The key ingredient of that great moderation that we became accustomed to before the financial crash, but which together, in partnership, we have to earn again. Everyone invited to the summit is here for that reason, Starmer says Private sector investment is the way we rebuild this country and pay our way in the future. This is a great moment to back Britain, he insists – to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. He cites the “amazing” education sector, the largest tech sector in Europe, a leading position in ley sectors such as artificial intelligence, clean energy, the creative industries. A legal system that sets high standards around the globe, and a geographical location that means we can speak to colleagues in the Americas and in Asia in the same day. Starmer continues, saying that we live in an age where political fires rage across the world – conflict, insecurity, and “a populist mood” that opposes the open values that “many of us” at the investment summit hold dear. And yet, we also live in an “age of great possibility”, he argues, with businesses making investments, in areas such as digital technology, clean energy, medicine, life sciences. Each have the potential to change how we live, and to improve the lives of working people, the PM says. Starmer then argues that you can “stops a country turning in on itself” if you provide the benefits of growth to people., saying: In times like this, economic growth is vital – as it always been – if we’re to steer our way through a great period of insecurity and change and onto calmer waters. The shared ambition at today’s investment summit is growth, Keir Starmer says. Business leaders have to grow their business, while the PM has to grow the country. The “shared endeavour” of prosperity is what binds investors and the government together, he insisted. Starmer says he’s determined that the UK becomes the highest growing economy in the G7 – that’s the way to deliver the change he has promised. Sir Keir Starmer now takes the stage at the Investment Summit. He says it’s fantastic to see so many attendees at the new government’s first summit. Some investors have flown a long way to come to the Guildhall, the PM says, to share the “precious gift” of your time. He tells investors that he briefly pursued his education on the flute at the nearby Guildhall School of Music, with “long hair and very flared jeans”. Starmer says all photographic evidence has been destroyed (if you know better, get in touch!). Jonathan Reynolds wraps up by telling investors that Britain is making a “world-beating offer” for those who make the UK their investment destination of choice. He hopes they will leave “inspired”, and confident that the UK has a government that wants them to be at the forefront of our new, pro-innovation, pro-business, pro-wealth creation economy. Here’s a live feed of the key speeches at today’s International Investment Summit: Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds adds that the UK government is guided by four key principles: Building long-term stability renewing its commitment to free and fair trade cutting costs for investors working in partnership with business and trade unions He tells the investment summit: Our industrial strategy will create long-term, sustainable, inclusive and secure growth. The strategy will focus on eight areas, Reynolds adds: advanced manufacturing; clean energy industries, creative industries; defence; digital and technologies; financial services; life sciences; and professional and business services. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds is opening today’s International Investment Summit at Guildhall. Reynolds declares that the UK is “back”, “back at the global table”, and open for business. The UK has so much potential, Reynolds says, citing the open economy, legal protections, incentives for innovation, and a skilled workforce. Naomi Smith, chief executive of campaign group Best for Britain, hopes that Keir Starmer’s war on bureaucracy will address some of the hurdles created by Brexit, saying: “Cutting red tape must include the mountain that Brexit has created for almost every part of the UK economy but particularly SMEs, touring performers and export/import businesses. “Beneficial alignment with our largest market in areas like food standards and carbon taxes will reduce costs for businesses and consumers, give confidence to investors and boost growth.” Major CEOs and investors arriving at Guildhall are being whisked through the front door, with umbrella carriers protecting them from the London weather (it’s pretty wet today, again). Journalists, though, are being let in through the loading bay entrance, points out The Sun’s Ashley Armstrong: Logistics giant DP World has confirmed that it will invest £1bn to expand its London Gateway container port, after the row with transport secretary Louise Haigh was defused by Downing Street. The expansion, announced at today’s investment summit, will turn London Gateway, on the banks of the Thames in Essex, into Britain’s “largest container port within five years”, DP World says. The plan is to build two new shipping berths, taking the total to six berths, all large enough for the world’s biggest container ships. This will expand the quayside at London Gateway to more than 2.5km in length. The site will also get a second rail terminal added to handle the expected increase in containerised trade. The pledge follows the frantic effort by ministers and diplomats to repair relations with DP World, after Haigh called its P&amp;O Ferries division a “rogue operator” when announcing new workers’ protections this week. DP World say the expansion will create a further 400 permanent new jobs, on top of the 1,20 workers already employed at the former oil refinery. It points out, though, that the expansion is subject to planning approval and regulatory requirements, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman and chief executive officer at DP World, says: “DP World London Gateway will help make Britain’s trade flow in the future by connecting domestic exporters with global markets and delivering vital supply chain resilience for the whole economy. I am proud of this major investment which underlines DP World’s long-term commitment to the UK.” Photos of a meeting at the investment summit have landed. They show global co-chief investment officer of Blackstone Lionel Assant, and Ruth Porat, the chief investment officer of Google, with Porat alongside Keir Starmer: Q: Most investors will tell you, in private, that the biggest barrier for the UK is being outside the single market. Wouldn’t rejoining the single market be the brave thing to do? Peter Kyle argues that the UK and Europe have to look to the future, and explore their potential as two seperate territories. There are lots of opportunities, and barriers, that weren’t around in 2016, Kyle says, adding: We’re looking at a trade deal that explores all the opportunities going forward. Kyle then explains how he visited Seattle in February this year, pitching Labour’s plans to the head of Amazon Web Services. That led to AWS’s announcement of £8bn investment in Britain last month, he says: And on Elon Musk’s non-appearance at the summit, Kyle doesn’t explicitely say whether the Tesla/SpaceX chief was ever invited or not, before the row over his critical tweets this summer. Kyle says the government would “love to engage” with Musk, when he has an open investment programme to compete for. Q: Won’t some traditional Labour supporters be a little bit unnerved by the government speaking the language of the Tories – slashing red tape, getting rid of bureaucracy, getting into bed with big business? Kyle argues everyone should celebrate that if you create a new innovation in this country it will create wealth and jobs. Q: Why did the PM tick off one of his own ministers [transport secretary Louise Haigh] for a Number 10-approved press release [which labelled P&amp;O a “rogue employer”] Kyle points out that the Today Programme, and everyone else, criticised what P&amp;O did in 2022 [it sacked its staff without notice, and replaced them with cheaper agency workers]. P&amp;O and its owner DP World have now signed up to the government’s new workers’ rights legislation, he says, echoing his earlier point that DP World and the UK have both turned a corner. Q: Are you so keen at the top of the Labour Party to get close to big business that you’ll ditch your own cabinet ministers’ words? Kyle says the government is keen to show you can raise standards and attract innovation – he argues that this is happening, with DP World sticking to its £1bn investment plan (which looked shaky last week). Q: The boss of [US pharmaceuticals firm] Eli Lily has argued that a small market, such as the UK, must be willing to regulate less than the EU to make it attractive for investors to come here. Is that the plan? Kyle argues that the key is to regulate “smartly” and “creatively”, going back to his point about wanting to help companies get through the regulatory process without cutting corners…. Peter Kyle is now on the Today programme, for a pre-investment summit grilling, where he denies that Keir Starmer’s war on red tape will lead to cutting corners. Q: What bureaucracy will the government ‘rip out’’? Kyle gives the example of the Regulatory Innovation Office which he announced last week. That Office takes the learnings from Covid vaccine taskforce, to speed up deployment of innovations faster in normal times, Kyle says. He explains that currently, it can take up to three years for a new product to get through the regulatory minefield, before it can be made available. Kyle adds: Not cutting corners or lowering standards, but making sure that the government takes on some of the burden of compliance, so that our nation can benefit. Q: What if the NHS wants to hold the price of an innovative drug down, or doesn’t want to deploy a new development, anti-obesity drugs for example. Are you willing to get rid of that red tape in order to allow big US pharma giants to push their drugs into the health service quicker? “We are,” Kyle replies. He points out that for the first time ever, health secretary Wes Streeting has taken responsibility for spreading innovation through the NHS. More highlights from Peter Kyle’s morning media round: Peter Kyle has also argued that P&amp;O and the UK have both “turned a corner”, following the row between transport minister Louise Haigh and parent company DP World. Asked by Times Radio about the clash, the technology and innovation secretary argued that both sides were ‘looking to the future’: “Like your listeners, I was angry with the way P&amp;O acted back then. “But, actually, P&amp;O has changed because last week we introduced workers’ rights legislation which would stop that kind of thing happening again and P&amp;O were right there, right behind it. “DP World, their parent company, were right behind it. They will be here today and they are continuing their £1bn investment. “That means we’ve all turned a corner. They’ve turned a corner, our country has turned a corner and we are looking to the future.” Haigh’s criticism of P&amp;O was well-founded, though. After sacking 800 workers in 2022, the ferry operator paid some crew members less than half the UK minimum wage, the Guardian reported in March this year. Some agency workers received as little as £4.87 an hour. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will not be at today’s summit. It emerged last month that Musk would not be invited, following his controversial social media posts during last month’s riots. Peter Kyle, the UK’s Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, has defended Musk’s non-appearance. He told Sky News this morning that Elon Musk had not attended any investment summits under the previous government either. Q: So it’s not because he calls the prime minister ‘two-tier Keir’? Kyle denies it, saying: Absolutely not. Our PM puts country first, party second, he’s said that numerous times. Kyle says the summit is focused on companies who are already actively looking to make investment around the world, engaging with them and getting them here. He says £40tn of global assets are represented in London, looking for places to invest their money; the government wants to showcase the country and win investment. The first ministers from the British nations are all expected to attend the investment summit, as well as many regional mayors. Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be there, and says: “I’m delighted to be attending the International Investment Summit. With a new government, we are reclaiming Britain’s reputation as a magnet for global investment - bringing with it new technology, new ways of thinking and, crucially, new jobs across our country, meaning higher living standards. “London and the UK are open for business, trade and investment. I will continue working with the Government to forge new partnerships, reset relationships and seize the opportunity to secure long-term investment so that we can build a better London for everyone and deliver the change Britain needs.” The former England football manager and keen Labour supporter Gareth Southgate is expected at the investment summit today. Southgate will join actor and director Adjoa Andoh, Lucian Grainge, the chief executive of Universal Music Group, the company behind artists including Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey, and an executive from Netflix on a panel exploring investment opportunities in the UK’s creative scene. More here: Labour have received a boost ahead of today’s investment summit, with 14 top business leaders declaring that Britain has a “very real opportunity” to grow its economy. Senior executives from some of the world’s largest investors, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Aviva, Fidelity and Legal and General, have signed a letter declaring they are “optimistic” about Britain’s economic future. They cite Britain’s traditional strengths – education, the legal system, the City and the English language – before pointing out that “greater stability” makes the country even more attractive to invest in. The letter says: Sir, As global investors, we believe that there is a very real opportunity for the UK to grow its economy by attracting international investment. Britain’s educational establishments, legal system, financial services sector and language form the bedrock of a strong investment proposition. Technological developments, advances in the energy system and greater freedom in capital flows have further enhanced Britain’s position. With greater stability, its attractiveness is increased even further. We are optimistic about the future of the economy, and believe it is time to invest in Britain. It’s been signed by: Amanda Blanc, Aviva; Anne Richards, Fidelity International; António Simões, Legal and General; Beatriz Martin Jimenez, UBS; Bernard Mensah, Bank of America; Bill McDermott, ServiceNow; Cath Bowtell, IFM Investors; David M Solomon, Goldman Sachs; Dr Markus Krebber, RWE AG; Filippo Gori, JP Morgan; Jonathan D Gray, Blackstone; Philipp Freise, KKR; Steve Rigby, Rigby Group; and Viswas Raghavan, Citi. Their point about ‘stability’ will be welcomed by Starmer, who is expected to argue today that stability leads to growth, and that growth leads to stability. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Sir Keir Starmer will pledge today to scrap regulation that holds back company investment, as the UK welcomes major business leaders and investors to the new government’s first international investment summit. Today’s summit will see Labour pitching the UK as a place where economic stability has been restored, creating the right conditions for growth and investment. Starmer will address CEOs and investors at London’s Guildhall this morning, and vow to do “everything in my power to galvanise growth”. He’ll pledge to end the “chop and change” that has riddled Britain in recent years, deterring investment. And on the issue of regulation, the PM is expected to promise to look at rules that “needlessly” hold back the investment the country needs, by saying: “Where it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it then mark my words – we will get rid of it. “We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.” One person’s needless red tape is another’s vital standards, though, and there are fears that cutting regulation could be unsafe. One union source has likened Starmer’s words to former PM David Cameron’s “bonfire of red tape”, telling us: “The coalition also had a massive shake-up of red tape, and ended up taking out loads of safety regulations.” About 200 senior executives are signed up to participate in the summit, as well as a string of cabinet ministers, including Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The government’s argues that securing new investment from major companies will help it deliver economic growth, create jobs, lift living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off. It says ministers set to unveil billions worth of major investment deals in AI, life sciences and infrastructure. According to the Financial Times, Starmer will unveil commitments from the private sector to invest more than £50bn into the economy. Last week, the leaders of the world’s biggest green energy companies got the ball rolling by pledging more than £24bn of new private investment. The build-up to the summit was marred, though, by the row with Dubai-based ports company DP World, after Louise Haigh, transport secretary, called its P&amp;O Ferries division a “rogue operator” due to its sacking of 800 employees without notice in 2022. The government rowed back, after DP World threatened to pause a £1bn investment in its London Gateway port, with business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Starmer placating the company, so the company’s executives should now be attending. After Starmer gives his speech, he’ll hold a conversation with the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, “moderated” by Emma Walmsley, the chief executive of pharmaceutical firm GSK. Other panels will involve the chief investment officer of Google owner Alphabet, the chair of investment firm BlackRock, Larry Fink, and Amanda Blanc, the boss of insurance group Aviva.

                    "headline": "Westminster’s reliance on Elon Musk’s X is ‘totally wrong’, says Labour MP",
                    "bodyText": "Westminster needs to wean itself off X, a close ally of Keir Starmer has said, as he suggested that Elon Musk was deliberately manipulating its algorithm to boost his own political and personal interests. Josh Simons, the MP for Makerfield and former head of the Starmerite thinktank Labour Together, said he believed the British political class was dangerously addicted to the platform, formerly known as Twitter. Simons maintains an active X profile, but says he is keen not to “overuse” it. His comments reflect a growing concern among Labour MPs about the impact of X after the summer’s riots, during which misinformation spread rapidly on the platform. But they also threaten to exacerbate tensions between the government and the company, with Musk continuing to attack Starmer over ministers’ response to the violence. Simons, a technology expert who wrote a book on artificial intelligence, told the Guardian in an interview: “I think that Twitter’s algorithm, its ranking model, which determines what we see on Twitter when we open it, has manifestly changed since Elon Musk took over. Not least because I don’t think I’ve ever liked anything that he said ever, and I see loads of him all the time, and I really don’t want to. “I’ve even said: ‘Show less of this,’ and there he is, every time. And that’s a sure sign – when a founder and owner of a company, you see more of them on an algorithm, despite not liking them – [of] something going on.” He added: “I think that it is totally and completely wrong and harmful to British democracy that the Westminster bubble gets to know each other through a ranking model designed by a man who’s spending his life campaigning for Donald Trump. I think that it’s shortsighted of us all.” X did not respond to a request to comment. Relations between the government and the social media company have been tense since the summer’s riots, which experts say were fanned by online misinformation regarding the identity of the attacker who killed three children in Southport. As the violence escalated, Musk posted repeatedly about them, including one video of riots in Liverpool, which he annotated with the quote “civil war is inevitable”. Downing Street publicly criticised those comments, saying they had “no justification”, and in turn was greeted with another volley of angry posts from Musk. The X owner renewed his attack on the Labour government last month after not receiving an invitation to Monday’s international investment summit. “I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles [sic] in order to imprison people for social media posts,” he posted, in apparent reference to the government’s early release scheme. Many Labour MPs have quit X and set up profiles on rival platforms such as Bluesky instead. Simons, who used to work for Meta on its AI programme and is now standing for election to the Commons technology select committee, said he thought the new generation of MPs were more sceptical about the platform than their predecessors. “The mood is changing quite radically,” the 31-year-old said. “I actually think Twitter has a bit of a sort of Boomers/Gen-Xer thing about it. It’s interesting that among the new intake, quite a lot of people are quite sceptical about it. It doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t ever use it, not least because it gives us another tool to be seen on.” He also said he believed the debate over AI had been dominated for too long by older politicians who did not grow up steeped in technology in the way his own generation did. Such people, he said, were often either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about how the technology could change the way government works. The former prime minister Tony Blair and the former Conservative leader William Hague have been two of the most outspoken advocates for the widespread adoption of AI by the public sector. The former prime minister Rishi Sunak has spoken positively about its potential but also warned about its “existential risk” to humanity. Simons said: “There is a generation [that] didn’t actually grow up with data and technology, and they have these very simplistic, reductivist, often either utopian or apocalyptic ways of thinking about the future of the state or public services or the economy in relation to technology. “AI can often be a distraction from going one level deeper into the technology, in order to understand its policy and political implications better.”"

                    "headline": "Nobel winner Geoffrey Hinton is the ‘godfather of AI’. Here’s an offer he shouldn’t refuse…",
                    "bodyText": "Way back in 2011 Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist with aspirations to be a public intellectual, published an essay entitled “Why Software Is Eating the World”, predicting that computer code would take over large swaths of the economy. Thirteen years on, software now seems to be chomping its way through academia as well. This, at any rate, is one possible conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton shares the 2024 Nobel prize in physics with John Hopfield, and that the computer scientist Demis Hassabis shares half of the Nobel prize in chemistry with one of his DeepMind colleagues, John Jumper. The award to Hassabis and Jumper was, in a way, predictable, for they built a machine – AlphaFold2 – that enables researchers to solve one of the toughest problems in biochemistry: predicting the structure of proteins, the building blocks of biological life. Their machine has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200m proteins that researchers have identified. So it’s a big deal – for chemistry. But Hinton is not a physicist. Indeed, he was once introduced at an academic conference as someone who had “failed at physics, dropped out of psychology and then joined a field with no standards at all: artificial intelligence”. And he spent a year after graduation working as a carpenter. Yet he’s the guy who found the method (“backpropagation”) that enables neural networks to learn, which was one of the two keys that unlocked machine learning and triggered the current manic rise of AI. (The other was the invention of the transformer model by Google researchers in 2017). Where’s the physics in all this, though? That comes from Hopfield, with whom Hinton shares the prize. “Hopfield networks and a further development of them called Boltzmann machines were based on physics,” Hinton explained to the man from the New York Times. “Hopfield nets used an energy function, and the Boltzmann machine used ideas from statistical physics. So that stage in the development of neural networks did depend – a lot – on ideas from physics.” So that’s all right then. But the media often describe Hinton as “the godfather of AI”, which has a vaguely sinister ring to it. In person he’s the opposite: tall, amiable, courteous, cerebral and endowed with a wry and occasionally caustic wit. When asked by Cade Metz for his reaction when he got the news of the prize, he replied that he was “shocked and amazed and flabbergasted”, which I guess is what most people say. But in 2018 he shared the Turing award – computer science’s equivalent of the Nobel – with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. So he was always in the top league. It’s just that there isn’t a Nobel prize in computer science. Given the way software is eating the world, maybe that should change. There’s an old joke that the key to becoming a Nobel laureate is to “live longer” than your rivals. Hinton, now 77, clearly took note. But actually the most admirable thing about him is the dogged persistence with which he continued to believe in the potential of neural networks as a key to artificial intelligence long after the idea had been discredited by the discipline. Given how academia works, especially in a fast-developing discipline like computer science, that required exceptional determination and self-confidence. Perhaps what kept him going in his darker moments was the thought that his great-great-grandfather was George Boole, the 19th-century mathematician who invented the logic that underpins all of this digital stuff. One thinks also about the impact that the prize has on people. When news of Hinton’s prize came through I thought of Seamus Heaney, who was awarded the literature prize in 1995. He described the experience as “like being hit by a mostly benign avalanche”. Note that “mostly”: one of the consequences of a Nobel is that winners immediately become public property, of which everyone and their dog wants a slice. “All I do nowadays is ‘turn up’,” Heaney wrote resignedly to a friend in June 1996. “I’m a function of timetables, not an agent of my own being. And it’s going to be like this for weeks and months still… Whatever the Stockholm effect will be finally, its immediate result is a desire to quit the job and get started again in propria persona (in my own person).” So… Memo to Geoff: many congrats. And keep control of your calendar. What I’ve been reading Talk this way Is a Chat With a Bot a Conversation? is a fabulous New Yorker essay by the historian Jill Lepore about her interactions with GPT-4o, Advanced Voice mode. Interesting times… October 2, 2024. This particular issue of Heather Cox Richardson’s indispensable Substack blog is a gem.

                    "bodyText": "A Melbourne lawyer has been referred to the Victorian legal complaints body after admitting to using artificial intelligence software in a family court case that generated false case citations and caused a hearing to be adjourned. In a 19 July 2024 hearing, an anonymous solicitor representing a husband in a dispute between a married couple provided the court with a list of prior cases that had been requested by Justice Amanda Humphreys in relation to an enforcement application in the case. When Humphreys returned to her chambers, she said in a ruling that neither herself nor her associates were able to identify the cases in the list. When the matter returned to court the lawyer confirmed that the list had been prepared using legal software Leap, and he said there was an AI element to Leap’s software. He acknowledged he did not verify the accuracy of the information before submitting it to the court. In the initial ruling, first reported by Crikey, the lawyer was given a month to respond as to why he should not be referred to the Legal Services Board and Commissioner for investigation, and in a ruling from August and published this month, Humphreys referred the solicitor for investigation. In her ruling, Humphreys says the solicitor admitted the AI software had been used to generate the list but it had not been reviewed by he or anyone else, and the cases were not real. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The lawyer offered an “unconditional apology” to the court and said he would “take the lessons learned to heart” and asked not to be referred for investigation. He said he did not fully understand how the software worked, and acknowledged the need to verify AI-assisted research for accuracy. He made a payment to the solicitors for the other party for the costs of the thrown away hearing. Humphrey said she accepted the apology and acknowledged the stress it caused meant it was unlikely to be repeated, but a referral for investigation was important given it was in the public interest for the Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner to examine professional conduct issues, given the increasing use of AI tools in law. Humphrey noted the family court had not yet issued guidelines on AI use, but the supreme court of Victoria and the county court of Victoria’s guidelines state practitioners using AI tools should know how they work and their limitations. A spokesperson for Leap told Guardian Australia that verifying the work was a key part of a lawyer’s ethical obligations. The company said it provides a free verification process where a human, local experienced lawyer examines the output from its software to ensure accuracy. The spokesperson said that verification process was done in this case, but those documents were not used by the lawyer. The software firm did not elaborate on why they were not used, and the man’s name has been kept anonymous. “Despite the legal professional using [Leap software] LawY’s verification process, which sent the user the correct information just four hours after requesting it and well before appearing in court, the user unfortunately did not utilise this correct information in court,” the spokesperson said. “This example provides a timely reminder that AI is a powerful tool but must be used appropriately by users to add value to legal practice.” The company said 66,000 legal professionals worldwide use its software. An August 2024 announcement from Leap states that firms can “generate precedents with ease using AI” with AI-powered templates to be used to produce letters, emails and forms in less than a minute. The case is not the first of lawyers being provided false information via use of AI tools. In Canada in March, a lawyer in a custody case who used ChatGPT to find previous case law found the large language model provided false cases. It was also reported last year that lawyers representing a man allegedly injured on a flight had also used ChatGPT to find cases to support their argument and found the software had generated what the court called “bogus opinions”."

                    "bodyText": "Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has launched its artificial intelligence assistant in the UK, alongside AI-boosted sunglasses modelled by Mark Zuckerberg. Meta’s AI assistant, which can generate text and images, is now available on its social media platforms in the UK and Brazil, having already been launched in the US and Australia. Regulatory issues and product testing held up the UK launch, while Meta’s AI services remain unavailable in the EU due to the “unpredictable” regulatory environment. Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will now be able to access the Meta AI chatbot by tapping on an icon in their app or by buying a pair of £299 Ray-Ban Meta frames from a UK retailer and accessing its voice assistant. Zuckerberg, Meta’s co-founder, sported a pair of the Ray-Bans at a company event last month when he also announced that Meta AI would be able to respond to voice commands and use the voice of celebrities including Judi Dench, John Cena and Keegan-Michael Key. However, the celebrity voice assistant will not be available in the UK. Meta said the latest rollout, which also includes the Philippines, “will help people get answers to their questions, brainstorm content and bring their ideas to life in places where they can easily share the results with their local network and our broader global community”. Meta’s AI products, powered by the company’s Llama 3.2 AI model, have been the focus of attempts by social media users to block the company from using their posts to train its AI tools. One viral post with the message “Goodbye Meta AI!” was shared by actors and sports stars – including James McAvoy and Tom Brady – before it emerged that the post gave no privacy or copyright protection. Instead, UK users who wish to stop Meta from using their Facebook and Instagram posts to train its AI models need to fill out an objection form that can be obtained in their apps’ privacy settings. However, users of Meta’s AI products cannot block their interactions with the AI tools – as opposed to their actual social media posts – from being used to train and finetune the Llama model. Last week Meta said it had built a new artificial intelligence model called Movie Gen that could create realistic video and audio clips in response to user prompts – including a surfing koala. However, like OpenAI’s Sora video model, Movie Gen is not yet publicly available."

The US government may ask a judge to force the breakup of Google’s business as it attempts to challenge the tech corporation’s monopoly over the internet search market. The Department of Justice has filed court papers that say it is considering enforcing “structural remedies” that would prevent Google from using some of its products such as Chrome, Android and Play, which the DoJ argues give the company an advantage over rivals. Other actions being considered include blocking Google from paying to have its search engine pre-installed on smartphones and other devices. Google, which is owned by Alphabet, said it would challenge any case by the DoJ and that the proposals marked an “overreach” by the government that would harm consumers. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK Two scientists at Google DeepMind and an American biochemist have been awarded the 2024 Nobel prize in chemistry for breakthroughs in predicting and designing the structure of proteins. Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s British founder, and John Jumper, who led the development of the company’s AI model AlphaFold– which predicts the structure of proteins based on their chemical sequence – share half of the prize. The other half was awarded to Prof David Baker, of the University of Washington, whose computational research has led to the creation of entirely new kinds of proteins, with applications in vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors. The winners were announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, and will share the 11m Swedish kronor (£810,000) prize for computational protein design and protein structure prediction. On Wall Street, shares have turned positive after earlier modest declines. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 both edged 0.2% higher. Google owner Alphabet has fallen by 1.5%, after after it emerged that the US government may ask a judge to force the breakup of Google’s business, in an attempt to challenge the tech corporation’s monopoly over the internet search market.

Nick Read, the chief executive of the Post Office, has criticised the former chair of the state-owned body for falling asleep in board meetings and said he had received reports that he had reduced his personal assistant to tears. Read, who was testifying before the Post Office public inquiry, criticised Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair who was sacked in January by the then business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. Read said in his written witness statement to the inquiry that Karen McEwan, chief people officer at Post Office had spoken to him directly about Staunton’s behaviour “which she thought was appalling.” Read said in his witness statement: She said that he did not treat women well and had reduced his personal assistant to tears. Read added in his testimony that he had witnessed Staunton “be quite dismissive and rude” to Lorna Gratton, a non-executive director, at a Post Office board meeting in November 2023, “which was uncomfortable and awkward.” He also said that he got the impression that another non-executive director Amanda Burton “had felt a bit bullied and intimidated by him.” He added that Staunton’s behaviour had been fed back to the Department of Business and Trade “and that DBT were considering what to do.” Read said in the written statement: I explained that from my perspective I had witnessed the incident with Lorna at the board meeting and that I had also witnessed unprofessional behaviour, such as falling asleep in board and shareholder meetings (which the shareholder was aware of). The perception, shared by me and others, was that Henry was fatigued, and was not close enough to the issues on redress and the evidence emerging from the inquiry. He would frequently report surprise at the amount of time he had to dedicate to the role, and the impression given was that he had signed up for a different job to the one he found himself in,” Read continued adding that he felt the manner of Staunton’s departure was “poorly handled and unnecessarily humiliating.” Staunton has previously claimed he was the victim of a “smear campaign” led by Badenoch. In Staunton’s own evidence to the inquiry last week he said that he was not aware until December that allegations had been made against him. Staunton said in his witness statement: I deny those allegations completely, and felt deeply stung by them. At the Post Office, as in my career previously, I was a champion of diversity. I find racism and misogyny utterly abhorrent. He added that he found the allegations “deeply distressing” and he knew they “would be contested by everyone who knows me. “ Here is our story on the Post Office boss Nick Read’s appearance before the Horizon inquiry: The chief executive of the Post Office has said that no employee is “above the law” and denied that there are “untouchables” within the organisation who will never face disciplinary action over the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of post office operators.

Glencore’s billionaire former head of oil trading, Alex Beard, and five other ex-employees of the Swiss-based global commodity trader will stand trial in a London court in 2027 on bribery charges. Beard, who indicated at his first court appearance last month that he will plead not guilty, was not formally asked to enter a plea at a brief hearing at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday, Reuters reported. The 57-year-old is charged with two counts of conspiracy to make corrupt payments to government officials and officials of state-owned oil companies in Nigeria between 2010 and 2014, and in Cameroon between 2007 and 2014. In August, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office Beard with conspiring to make corrupt payments to benefit the commodities company’s oil operations in West Africa. Beard, who ran Glencore’s oil division from 2007 until his retirement in 2019, will face charges alongside former Glencore executives Andrew Gibson, Paul Hopkirk, Ramon Labiaga and Martin Wakefield after a long-running investigation into allegations of bribery at the company. Beard, who became a billionaire when Glencore listed in London in 2011, is the highest profile individual charged after the SFO’s sweeping investigation into Glencore which began in 2019 under the codename Operation Azoth. The pound has touched a one-month low against the dollar, as markets reassess the varying interest rate paths of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Sterling has slipped by 0.2% to $1.3075. The dollar hit a one-month high against a basket of major currencies. Sterling has been under pressure since Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said in an interview with the Guardian last week that the central bank could become “more aggressive” on interest rate cuts if inflation pressures continue to weaken. Previously, the pound had been supported by expectations that the Fed would cut much more than the Bank this year. But it is now down by more than 2% since the start of the month. Here is some analysis from last week: The Bank of Israel kept interest rates unchanged today for the sixth time in a row, maintaining a cautious stance as Israel’s year-long war with Hamas in Gaza and fighting with Hezbollah in Lebanon has led to higher inflation and weaker economic activity. The central bank, which is also worried about Israel’s rising investor risk premium, left its benchmark rate at 4.5%. It cut the rate by 25 basis points in January after inflation eased and economic growth slowed amid the Gaza war, but kept policy steady in February, April, May, July and August. Israel’s annual inflation rate rose to 3.6% in August from 3.2% in July, further above the government’s 1%-3% target range, after falling as low as 2.5% in February. Its economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.7% in the second quarter, a sharp slowdown from the 17.2% growth in the first quarter. UK bank CEOs gathered in Whitehall this morning for a meeting with Rachel Reeves, who was trying to sound out what kind of post-budget measures could support the City and drive forward the government’s growth agenda. It is understood that the heads of major lenders including HSBC’s new group chief executive Georges Elhedery, NatWest Group’s Paul Thwaite and Santander UK’s Miles Regnier took part in a discussion about competitiveness and City regulation. That included how upcoming Basel 3 rules would be implemented, as well as continued concerns around fraud, just days after new compensation rules came into force. Ultimately, there was “nothing groundbreaking” discussed as part of the meeting, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. And nothing, apparently, that would give bank bosses a steer on what might happen around the budget. The annual Mansion House dinner, which is a set piece for the new chancellor and gives her a chance to address City leaders, is due to take place on 14 November. The British paper and packaging firm Mondi is the top riser on the FTSE 100, after it struck a deal to buy the German, Benelux and UK packaging assets of the German family business Schumacher Packaging for €634m including debt, to expand in Western Europe. Mondi shares are up by 4.6%. The company lost out in a takeover battle for London-based rival DS Smith after US firm International Paper, one of the largest paper and pulp companies in the world, outbid it. Ireland’s Smurfit Kappa bought US rival Westrock in July to create Smurfit Westrock. Mondi’s chief executive Andrew King said: This acquisition significantly increases our corrugated converting capacity, extends our reach across Western Europe, and offers strong downstream integration opportunities. Wall Street futures are pointing to a lower open in half an hour, as investors await the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, out tonight, and inflation data tomorrow. Shares in Google owner Alphabet are down by 0.7% in pre-market trading, after it emerged that the US government is considering asking a judge to force the breakup of Google’s business as it attempts to challenge the tech corporation’s monopoly over the internet search market. Stocks in the UK and the rest of Europe are slightly down (France, Italy) or slightly higher (UK, Germany). Here is our full story on the earlier slump in Chinese stocks: Chinese stocks have suffered their worst fall in 27 years after efforts by Beijing to stimulate the world’s second-largest economy disappointed investors. Stock markets in Asia fell sharply after China’s top economic planning authority failed to announce further measures to improve flagging growth. On Tuesday, the National Development and Reform Commission held a press conference in which officials were expected to reveal specific policies to supplement the stimulus measures announced last month. However, the hoped-for policy plans were not forthcoming. Instead, the NDRC officials mostly summarised September’s announcements and commented on the general economic situation. Top banks are pushing the UK to relax its stance on deferred bonuses and clawbacks as regulators prepare to revise their post-financial crisis rulebook, Bloomberg reports. Discussions between financial firms and watchdogs are intensifying over the UK’s rules, which were introduced to curb “excessive-risk taking” about a decade ago and are among the strictest in the world. Senior managers have to defer part of their pay for up to seven years, and face clawbacks for a decade if issues emerge. The topic has been a key focus for banks and their lobby groups since British regulators lifted a cap on bonuses last October, removing one of the key reforms introduced by the EU in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and clearing the way for awards above the previous limit of two times’ bankers’ salary. Under the previous Conservative government, the regulators were given an extra duty to support the UK’s competitiveness. Talks have ramped up in recent months and the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority will publish new proposals soon, Bloomberg said. In August, Barclays became the first UK bank to formally lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses originally imposed by the EU, opening the door for staff to receive 10 times their salaries in payouts. The announcement was made through an internal memo to staff, four months after shareholders at Barclays’ AGM approved the move to drop the measure. The global economy could face losses of $14.5 trillion over five years from a potential geopolitical conflict that causes widespread disruption to global trade and supply chains, according to Lloyd’s of London. The world’s biggest insurance market says that with more than 80% of the world’s imports and exports – around 11bn tons of goods – at sea at any given time, the closure of major trade routes due to a geopolitical conflict is one of the greatest threats to the global economy. The economic impacts of this (hypothetical) scenario stem primarily from severe damage to infrastructure in the conflict region and the need for realignment of global trade networks due to the enforcement of sanctions and the effects of compromised shipping lines. The impact on businesses depends on the region they are located in and its factors such as involvement in the conflict, reliance on international trade and the goods that would be delayed or lost due to the supply chain disruptions. Europe for example, which is heavily reliant upon other major economies for supplies like semiconductors for car and electronics manufacturing, could stand to lose up to $3.4trn. Rebekah Clement, Lloyd’s corporate affairs director, said: Lloyd’s is supportive of public-private efforts to avoid global crises such as shortages of vital commodities and is committed to helping businesses remain resilient and prepare for the risks from widespread disruptions and financial loss from countless global risks, including geopolitical stability. The value of insurance also extends to the compounding secondary impacts of geopolitical conflict, including downstream delays and interruptions by impacted trading partners and suppliers. Examples of insurance covers which can help businesses protect themselves against these impacts include political risk insurance and contingent business interruption, as well as dedicated war risk insurance. Taking a quick break from the inquiry. Tucking into a tub of Quality Street is Christmas tradition for many British families and once they have scoffed the chocolates the handy container takes on a new life as a cake tin or Lego storage box. But the really useful plastic tub could be looking at its last Christmas as the confectionery brand’s owner tests the reaction of Quality Street fans to a new paper container. While the new vessel is born out of a desire by the brand’s owner, Nestlé, to cut its use of virgin plastic the public reaction is hard to predict. In 2022 the decision to replace Quality Street’s colourful plastic wrappers with recyclable paper ones received mixed reviews. Indeed the TikTok riposte of one former Quality Street lover went viral after she called it a “travesty”, and said “who wants to eat this piece of garbage”. However Nestlé has stuck with the paper wrappers and has now gone a step further. It has produced around 200,000 of the paper tubs which will go on sale in selected Tesco stores from next week. But after years of shrinking tubs – mercifully this year the product has the same weight and recommended price of £5.50 – and altered line-ups Nestlé knows it has a hard sell on its hands. To this end it claims the tub, in the signature Quality Street purple, has a “luxurious design, and feel, and is embellished with gold foil”. It also has an “integrated re-close feature” which sounds like a fancy term for a lid. Jemma Handley, senior brand manager for Quality Street, said: We’re looking forward to seeing what Quality Street fans make of the paper tub. A lot of care and hard work has gone into the trial and we’re proud to be the first major manufacturer to trial a paper tub at Christmas. Post Office chief executive Nick Read has said some people at the organisation may have held the view that “not every quashed conviction” was an “innocent” subpostmaster. He told the long-running Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry: I don’t think I could say specifically that that is the case but there will be a view that not every quashed conviction will be innocent postmasters. The majority of the organisation would agree that the action that has been taken is absolutely the right action and whether there are guilty postmasters that have been exonerated really is no longer an issue. The chief executive of the Post Office has said that there are no staff involved in “postmaster-facing activities” who were involved in historical investigations and wrongful prosecutions, despite the controversy about so-called “untouchables” still in the organisation’s ranks. The public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has previously heard testimony that Nick Read, who joined as chief executive in 2019 with a pledge to “right the wrongs of the past”, has used the phrase “untouchables”. This refers to a group of the organisation’s investigators and staff involved in the pursuit of post office operators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal. On Tuesday, the inquiry was shown a whistleblowing document claiming there were “at least 120 employees” at the Post Office who “to a greater or lesser degree were involved in the wrongful prosecution of SPMs [sub-postmasters]”. “I have been very clear at no stage will we walk past allegations of wrongdoing in the organisation,” said Read, giving testimony on the first of three days at the inquiry. “Where evidence of wrongdoing is brought to my attention, or anyone else’s attention in the organisation, we will investigate and take action fully.” Jason Beer, counsel for the inquiry, asked Read on Wednesday about whether some staff involved in the investigation and wrongful prosecution of postmasters are the same personnel involved in the compensation claim procedure under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. Beer said that those individuals also attend face-to-face “good faith” meetings with subpostmasters, despite their historical actions. Read, who has submitted four witness statements totally 307 pages of written evidence to the inquiry, said: I can’t say there have not been individuals involved in improper investigations and wrongful prosecution who were involved in the handling of compensation claims under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. It depends what you mean involved. I am confident there are no individuals involved in postmaster-facing activity that had roles in the past where allegations or anything of wrongdoing has been brought to my attention. Nick Read, the outgoing chief executive of the Post Office, is appearing before the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. He is due to give three days of testimony from today. Read, who was brought in to replace Paula Vennells in 2019 and “right the wrongs of the past”, announced in the summer that he was stepping back from running the company to focus on preparing and proving that “nothing like this could happen again”. The executive, who has given himself 88 days to prepare for his appearance, has come under heavy criticism from witnesses and become embroiled in a reputational crisis of his own. You can watch the hearing here: My colleague Mark Sweney has looked at the key issues the judge-led inquiry is likely to ask him to explain. Some good news for the German economy, the biggest in Europe: exports unexpectedly rose in August thanks to strong demand from the UK and US. Exports increased by 1.3% in August compared with the previous month, according to data from the federal statistics office. Economists had expected a 1% decline. Germany’s foreign trade surplus widened to €22.5bn from €16.9bn in July, boosted by a sharp drop in imports, down by 3.4%. Volker Treier, head of foreign trade at the German Chamber of Commerce DIHK said: The second slightly increase in exports in a row is a small glimmer of hope, but no reason to sound the all-clear. He said manufacturers are still under pressure because of high costs for energy, tax and labour, along with too much paperwork. Fundamental improvements are urgently needed in Germany as a business location if the German export engine is to pick up in the long term. Exports of goods to the US were rose by 5.5% in August while shipments to the UK climbed by 5.7%. Here is our full story on Google: The US government may ask a judge to force the breakup of Google’s business as it attempts to challenge the tech corporation’s monopoly over the internet search market. The Department of Justice has filed court papers that say it is considering enforcing “structural remedies” that would prevent Google from using some of its products such as Chrome, Android and Play, which the DoJ argues give the company an advantage over rivals. Other actions being considered include blocking Google from paying to have its search engine pre-installed on smartphones and other devices. Google, which is owned by Alphabet, said it would challenge any case by the DoJ and that the proposals marked an “overreach” by the government that would harm consumers. Rio Tinto has swooped on the US company Arcadium Lithium in a £5.1bn takeover, trying to get a foothold in the supply of lithium, a key component in electric car batteries. It is a huge bet on the energy transition despite tough conditions in the global electric car market. Lithium is known as “white gold” due to its market value and silver colour. The London-listed metal and mining giant’s shares fell by 2.3%, while New York-listed Arcadium shares jumped by 31% in pre-market trade. Rio Tinto said it will pay $5.85 a share for the Pennsylvania-based lithium miner. That represents an almost 90% premium to Arcadium’s closing price of $3.08 a share on 3 October, the day before news of a potential deal emerged. The acquisition will give the Anglo-Australian company access to lithium mines, processing facilities and deposits in Argentina, Australia, Canada and the US, as well as a client roster that includes the carmakers Tesla, BMW and General Motors. Lithium prices have fallen because of Chinese oversupply and a slowdown in electric vehicle sales, turning miners of the metal into attractive takeover targets. If the deal goes through, Rio Tinto will become the world’s third largest supplier of lithium, behind Albemarle and SQM. Rio Tinto’s chief executive Jakob Stausholm said the purchase is a significant step forward in Rio Tinto’s long-term strategy, creating a world-class lithium business alongside our leading aluminium and copper operations to supply materials needed for the energy transition. In Europe, stock markets are mixed. The FTSE 100 index in London has climbed by 30 points, or 0.38%, to 8,221 while Germany’s Dax and Italy’s FTSE MiB have slipped by 0.1%, and France’s CAC is up by 0.1%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has looked at the markets: Investors are searching for a sense of direction amid a cacophony of developments, as harsh geopolitical winds swirl and a fierce storm barrels towards Florida. Oil prices have tracked higher again, as hopes for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah fade, while Hurricane Milton threatens to disrupt energy supplies, with some pipelines and delivery terminals in Tampa already shut. Brent Crude is currently trading around $77.5 a barrel. Prices had dipped sharply yesterday, amid hopes the Hezbollah leadership would not tie negotiations for a ceasefire to what’s happening in Gaza. But given how previous deals in stopping violence in the Middle East have seemed so close, but have ultimately collapsed, it’s not surprising that confidence in agreeing even a limited break in the war is waning, prompting supply concerns to swirl again. The FTSE 100 is set to gain back a little ground, following yesterday’s losses, but caution is in the air following another highly volatile session for indices in Asia. The wave of enthusiasm which greeted the kitchen sink stimulus from the People’s Bank of China is ebbing away, given the lack of detail for further fiscal stimulus. Banks in China might be ready to lend, with lower rates and deposit requirements on offer, but if the demand isn’t there, it’s still set to hold back an economic rebound. Investors had been hoping for more details on an expected fiscal stimulus, hoping tax breaks would reinvigorate consumers and companies to borrow, but the vague plan put on the table yesterday by authorities disappointed. The Nikkei has climbed higher again, helped by ongoing weakness in the yen, up against the stronger dollar, which has been bolstered by expectations that the next rate cut from the Fed will be smaller than September’s big reduction. Stocks in China plunged, after a press briefing by Beijing’s top economic planner on Tuesday disappointed investors. They had hoped for more stimulus measures, but officials did not announce any major new steps. The Shenzhen Composite Index tumbled by 8.2% in its biggest fall since May 1997, while the Shanghai stock exchange lost 6.6% and the benchmark CSI 300 slid by 7.1% after the Golden Week holiday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down by 1.8%. Before the week-long holiday, Chinese stocks rallied when a raft of measures were announced by the People’s Bank of China and other authorities to revive the economy, the boldest stimulus package since the pandemic. China’s finance ministry is due to set out its plans on fiscal stimulus in more detail at a news conference on Saturday. Finance Minister Lan Fo’an will attend the conference, whose theme is “intensifying countercyclical adjustment of fiscal policy to promote high-quality economic development”. Investors are expecting a spending package between 4 and 10 trillion yuan (£220bn to £1.1tn). Richard Hunter, head of markets at the trading platform interactive investor, said: Shares in China underwent another difficult session as investor disappointment in the region persisted. The main concern was that the raft of measures announced prior to last week’s holiday – which had lit the fire under a moribund market – were not followed up with any specific actions from the authorities, or indeed further plans. The puncturing of enthusiasm fed through to commodity stocks. The minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s last meeting will be published tonight and may attract less interest than usual, given the raft of recent comments from Fed members as the economic picture has evolved. Hunter said: Indeed, any comments over concerns around a deteriorating labour market will have been eclipsed by last week’s bumper non-farm payrolls report, the result of which has been the tempering of interest rate cut expectations. Of rather more interest, perhaps, will be tomorrow’s reading on inflation in the form of the Consumer Price Index, which could show that the taming of inflation is just a whisker away from the Fed’s target. In the meantime, there is now a near 90% probability of a more subdued 0.25% cut in November in terms of consensus, with a small chance of no change at all beginning to surface. Oil prices are pushing higher again, after sliding yesterday amid talk of a potential ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is up 0.5% at $77.55 a barrel, a 37 cent gain, while US light crude has advanced by 0.3% to $73.78 a barrel. Prices lost more than 4% yesterday but markets are still concerned about a potential Israeli attack on Iran’s oil infrastructure. The selloff came after a rally in oil prices that began after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel on 1 October, culminating in an 8% gain last week, the biggest in more than a year. Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at the brokerage Phillip Nova in Sinagpore, said: The everyday dilemma of ‘Middle Eastern headlines’ moving like a pendulum between ‘ceasefire talks’ and ‘further escalation in attacks’ has been distracting investors from reality. Oil markets are twirled in sentiments of ‘buying the rumour’ and sidelining the real fundamentals that should matter. Central bankers in New Zealand have been busy overnight, cutting their key interest rates by half a percentage point. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered the cash rate to 4.75%, from 5.25%, a move which knocked the New Zealand dollar (known, rather sweetly, as the ‘kiwi’ in FX circles). The kiwi dollar tumbled 0.9% to $0.6084, the lowest since 19 August. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com, says: The main objective of this decision is to keep inflation within the target range of 1-3% and stabilize the economy, which has shown signs of weakening in recent months. This indicates that monetary authorities are willing to take additional measures, if necessary, to support growth. Google has criticised the DoJ’s proposal, calling them “radical” and arguing they “go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.” In a corporate blog post, Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president for Regulatory Affairs, claims that the US government is pursuing “a sweeping agenda that will impact numerous industries and products”, rather than simply focusing on the issue of search contracts. Mulholland argues that: Forcing Google to share your search queries, clicks, and results with competitors risks your privacy and security. Hampering Google’s AI tools risks holding back American innovation at a critical moment. Splitting off Chrome or Android would break them — and many other things Changes to the online advertising market would make online ads less valuable for publishers and merchants, and less useful for consumers. Unreasonable restrictions on how Google promotes our search engine would create friction for consumers and harm businesses. You can read the argument here. Also in the US overnight, attempts to end the Boeing workers strike have hit a roadblock – with the company withdrawing its pay rise offer. Boeing and the union held their latest round of negotiations with federal mediators on Monday and Tuesday, but talks collapsed and the sides were left locked in acrimonious stalemate showing no signs of being resolved anytime soon, a person briefed on the talks said. Nearly four weeks after the walkout began, no further negotiations were planned between Boeing and union representatives. Both sides blamed the other for the deadlock. “Unfortunately, the union did not seriously consider our proposals,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes head Stephanie Pope said in a note to the employees, calling the union’s demands “non-negotiable“. Pope added: “Further negotiations do not make sense at this point and our offer has been withdrawn.” But, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said in a statement that Boeing was “hell-bent on standing on the non-negotiated offer” proposed last month. The union said: “They refused to propose any wage increases, vacation/sick leave accrual, progression, ratification bonus, or the 401k Match/SCRC Contribution. They also would not reinstate the defined benefit pension.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Google is facing the threat of being broken up, as the US government weighs up how to tackle its monopoly in online search. In a court document filed overnight, the US Department of Justice suggests it could seek ‘structural remedies’ such as forced product sales – to prevent Google using its Chrome browser, Android operating system and Play app store to unfairly dominate the search market. Other, less radical, options are also under consideration, though. Introducing their case, the DoJ say: Google’s anticompetitive conduct resulted in interlocking and pernicious harms that present unprecedented complexities in a highly evolving set of markets. These markets are indispensable to the lives of all Americans, whether as individuals or as business owners, and the importance of effectively unfettering these markets and restoring competition cannot be overstated. The DoJ’s “proposed remedy framework” comes a month after a US judge ruled that Google had violated antitrust law and created an illegal monopoly. The case centred on Google’s use of exclusive agreements with device makers like Apple and Samsung, in which it paid billions of dollars to make sure that its product was the default search engine on their phones and tablets. The DoJ argues that the courts must address Google’s unlawful conduct is undoing its effects on search distribution, so rivals can compete for customers fairly. The court filing says: Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google’s control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow. At this stage, the plaintiffs are only “considering” behavioral and structural remedies – legal-speak for breaking the tech giant up. Other options include potentially restricting Google from using contracts and “monopoly profits” to control distribution channels and search-related products. Or, Google could be forced to share users’ search data with rivals. The plaintiffs also want the remedies to be forward-looking; they could include restricting Google from using search results to train new generative artificial intelligence models and products. They say: Google’s ability to leverage its monopoly power to feed artificial intelligence features is an emerging barrier to competition and risks further entrenching Google’s dominance. The Justice Department is expected to file a more detailed proposal with the court by 20 November, Reuters reports, while Google will have a chance to propose its own remedies by 20 December…..

                    "bodyText": "Two scientists at Google DeepMind and an American biochemist have been awarded the 2024 Nobel prize in chemistry for breakthroughs in predicting and designing the structure of proteins. Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s British founder, and John Jumper, who led the development of the company’s AI model AlphaFold– which predicts the structure of proteins based on their chemical sequence – share half of the prize. The other half was awarded to Prof David Baker, of the University of Washington, whose computational research has led to the creation of entirely new kinds of proteins, with applications in vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors. The winners were announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, and will share the 11m Swedish kronor (£810,000) prize for computational protein design and protein structure prediction. Hassabis and Jumper, who had been highly tipped as potential winners, discovered they had been awarded the prize just minutes before the announcement. “I don’t think they had either of our numbers,” said Hassabis, adding that his wife had declined several Skype calls before realising they were from a Swedish number. “It’s an unbelievable honour of a lifetime to receive the Nobel prize,” he said. “I spent my whole life working on AI, dreaming of this kind of impact … where we can use it for the benefit of society.” Speaking at a press briefing immediately after the announcement, Baker described how the ambition to create entirely new proteins began as a dream more than 20 years ago. Advances in computing and scientific understanding in the intervening years had paved the way for this vision to have a meaningful impact in the world, he said, including in the design of novel vaccines for coronavirus. “We glimpsed at the beginning that it might be possible to create a whole new world of proteins that address a lot of the problems faced by humans in the 21st century,” Baker said. “Now it’s becoming possible.” Heiner Linke, the chair of the Nobel committee for chemistry, said: “One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Both of these discoveries open up vast possibilities.” Proteins control and drive all the chemical reactions that are the basis of life. They function as hormones, antibodies and the building blocks of different tissues. Baker’s mission was to design new proteins that do not exist in nature, and in 2003, he succeeded. Since then, his group has produced novel proteins with wide-ranging applications in medicine and materials science. Proteins generally consist of 20 different amino acids, which are linked together in long strings that fold up to make three-dimensional structures. It is these structures – as well as the chemical composition – that determine how proteins will interact and whether, for instance, they will bind to a drug in the body. Since the 1970s, scientists have been working on what had become known as “the prediction problem”: working out a protein’s three-dimensional structure from its chemical sequence alone. The problem seemed theoretically intractable and progress was slow. Four years ago, there was a breakthrough. In 2020, Hassabis and Jumper announced the development of an AI model called AlphaFold 2. Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, Jumper said that deep learning models had provided the right kind of mathematics to tackle the “irreducible complexity of biology”. With its help, they have been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200m proteins that researchers have identified. Since their breakthrough, AlphaFold 2 has been used by more than 2 million people from 190 countries in applications such as understanding antibiotic resistance and developing enzymes that can decompose plastic. Hassabis said that Alphafold should be viewed as proof of AI’s potential for accelerating scientific discovery – and for benefiting society butadded that as a “dual purpose technology” AI also had the potential to be used for harm. “I’ve always felt it would be one of the most transformative technologies in human history,” he said. He added: “We really have to think very hard … about how to empower the good use cases while mitigating … the bad use cases. It carries risks as well and we need to be aware of those.” Dr Annette Doherty, the president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: “The benefits of this research are remarkable, as we can all look forward to applications improving our health and wellbeing. I am sure that their work will prove as inspirational to future generations as the discoveries of their predecessors who have been awarded this most prestigious honour.”"

                    "bodyText": "Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, the technology news editor at Guardian US. I’m taking over TechScape from Alex Hern, and I’d like to introduce myself and my ideas for this newsletter. A bit about me: I started working at the Guardian the day Sam Bankman-Fried went on trial. My first holiday from my new job coincided with the shock firing of Sam Altman from OpenAI. The story I tell over and over again at parties is the one about how I was arrested and jailed while reporting a story on deadly testicular injections. The new newsletter: TechScape plugs you into the politics, culture and consequences of technology. We’ll dissect the significance of the week’s most substantial tech news, investigate odd niches, catch you up on the best of the Guardian’s reporting and offer a helpful tip now and then. My version of TechScape is a newsletter about technology and the people making it. Tech – both as a product and an industry – is the biggest driver of change in our age. It intersects with every aspect of our lives and changes our everyday actions. Think of TechScape as a guide to the future and the futuristic present. Thank you for joining me. This week on my iPhone Average screen time per day: six hours and two minutes. Most used app: Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. This app, just downloaded last week, inflames my nostalgia for my teen trading card years, for better and worse. Quite a lot in the game has changed since then, so there’s much digital territory to explore. The elite Silicon Valley school testing a temporary total tech ban Leaders across the US, the UK and Europe are debating whether students should have cell phones in their hands during the school day. A growing number of people in power – everyone from presidents to school superintendents – believe they shouldn’t. California’s governor signed a bill last week mandating that schools reduce student screen time, and Los Angeles’s school district, the second-largest in the US, voted to prohibit phones on public high school campuses starting in 2025. The UK is not making its decision piecemeal like the US: ministers announced plans to ban phones in schools across the country in February. Hungary now requires schools to collect students’ devices at the start of the school day. France is in the midst of a trial ban on phones for students under 15. The Netherlands banned phones in schools as of 1 January 2024. The consensus is growing. It is a popular stance among both conservatives and progressives to take up arms against screen time. The opinion in vogue is that phones are bad for everyone, especially children. One problem: it is a truth universally acknowledged that a person living in our age must be in want of a smartphone. How to prepare students to balance the two competing necessities – screen time and screen-free time – within them? An elite school in the heart of Silicon Valley is asking students to reconsider their relationships with technology by putting their devices down. Castilleja, an all-girls private school where tuition is $62,400 per year, has banned cell phones in its Palo Alto, California, classrooms since before middle school head Laura Zappas can remember. Smart watches, too. The school is home to 185 students in grades six, seven, and eight, ages 11 to 14. This past school year, Zappas instituted an entirely tech-free week, telling every Castilleja student to lock up their devices – smartphones, smart watches, tablets and school-issued laptops – at the start of the day for a week in March. The girls took notes and completed all assignments on paper, recording data from science experiments in graph journals. They wrote down what homework they needed to finish in paper planners personally distributed by Zappas. They complained of cramps from hand-writing more lines in one day than in all the rest of the school year. “We’ve found that students with laptops – they can have a couple screens open at the same time,” said Zappas. “They could be messaging or they could be playing a game instead of taking notes. Or their immediate impulse to start the class was to come in and open their laptops right away rather than waiting for direction from the teacher or what they were doing. It was just this constant pull to the laptop.” The initiative, simply dubbed “Tech-Free Week”, served as a reset for the digital-first teaching practices of the pandemic era, Zappas said: “Before Covid, I think we were using a blend of paper and technology. And then I know that my own teaching shifted pretty dramatically with Covid and having to have all assignments had to be electronically submitted. And so after Covid, that just became our routine.” What would going unplugged look like as a way for our students and our teachers to really think more deeply about our relationship with technology? The administrator described Tech-Free Week as a pause for reconsideration: “What would going unplugged look like as a way for our students and our teachers to really think more deeply about our relationship with technology? How can we engage as a community together without screens?” The results were favorable: 42% of students reported improved focus in class and reduced distractions during schoolwork, according to a poll conducted by the school. Nearly three-quarters of the teachers asked for Zappas to repeat the initiative. She’s in talks with the upper school’s administration, grades nine through 12, about conducting a tech-free week for older students. Zappas emphasized that advance notice and copious preparation made tech-free week possible. She notified the school’s teachers of the initiative four months prior and pitched it to parents six weeks ahead. She asked that both teachers and parents consider how they can model a healthy relationship . That one tech-free week required so much planning would indicate that devices may be inextricable from modern life, even for students as young as 11. We had a French teacher who gave them all dictionaries, and she said they hadn’t ever seen a dictionary in French before. “We had a French teacher who gave them all dictionaries, and she said they hadn’t ever seen a dictionary in French before,” said Zappas. “And it took them quite some time then to figure out: ‘Well, what really is the right word I want to use here? How do I find that?’” Zappas advocates for striking healthy balances with screen time rather than wholesale abandonment of devices. She finds the debate over Jonathan Haidt’s Anxious Generation, which advocates for forbidding children from having smartphones until high school, rather overheated. I think it has to be about referencing things and not just banning them. Because we all have to be interacting with technology. “I don’t think that there’s one way to think about it. I think it has to be about referencing things and not just banning them. Because we all have to be interacting with technology. That’s how we’re going to prepare our students to live in the world in which we live,” she said. Zappas is not alone. On a local level – that is, among elite private schools in the US – the prevailing wisdom is shifting toward allowing access to devices, though only in controlled educational settings, one that casts the technology as what Zappas describes as “a school tool and a source for creation”.

                    "bodyText": "Criminals who targeted Françoise Schorosch’s father knew how to lull the elderly man into a false sense of security. “The sender of the email was someone impersonating me and asking for money,” she says. By mimicking how his daughter opens and signs off emails in German, but otherwise writes mostly in English, the fraudsters led him to think he was helping her with money to buy her first property. He is one of many thousands of people who, each year, are tricked into sending money to bank accounts operated by criminals. These frauds are known as authorised push payment (APP) scams, and the ballooning scale of the problem has prompted changes to the rules which take effect today. The mandatory fraud reimbursement scheme being brought in by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) includes these changes: Affected individuals can expect to be reimbursed within five business days of making their claim. There will be a maximum compensation of £85,000. This has been reduced from £415,000 after lobbying from the payments industry. There is an optional £100 excess that firms can apply to a claim – though some banks, such as TSB, have already pledged to waive it. And the PSR says this excess cannot be applied to “vulnerable” consumers. There will be a time limit of 13 months on claims. Once a bank or payment company has given the customer a refund, the financial institution can then claim half of the money back from the bank used by the criminal to receive it. The type of scam used to target the Schorosch family has been dubbed the “Hi dad” or “Hi mum” fraud. Schorosch is battling to get almost £6,000 returned to her father after he was duped into sending cash to a bogus Nationwide account. “I was sharing discussions about working with solicitors, surveyors and estate agents,” she says. “I had been keeping him abreast of all of the financials, and getting his advice because this was my first purchase. I suspect that someone managed to access our email exchange and then reach out to him directly.” The fraudster – who subtly altered Françoise’s email address from gmail.com to email.com – asked her father to send €7,000 to a Nationwide account. It wasn’t until he called her nearly a week later, wondering why she had not thanked him for the money, that they realised something was amiss. The family has filed police reports in both countries and appealed to both Nationwide and Deutsche Bank, where he sent the money from, for help getting his money back. Nationwide says it sympathises with the family. “We are unable to share any details about our customer’s account due to our confidentiality obligations, but can confirm that appropriate steps were taken to investigate and act upon the matters raised with us. “As the payment was sent from an account with Deutsche Bank, they need to contact them to help recover the funds. To date, we have had no contact from Deutsche Bank in relation to this payment.” The case is complicated by the fact that the contingent reimbursement model (CRM), a voluntary arrangement by some banks to refund victims, only applied to domestic payments, and not to transactions made using Swift, the money transfer system, used by her father. The new rules supersede the CRM and apply to all payment service providers – but do not cover Swift. Nationwide adds: “If we receive notification of a scam relating to a payment from overseas, we would still look to apply industry best practice to investigate and repatriate any funds that may remain.” The Observer asked Deutsche Bank – which says it could not share information due to German banking secrecy laws – to do this. Schorosch says her father was “devastated” by the incident. “He truly believed his daughter was reaching out to him for financial support and wanted to be of help. “He is now retired and living off a pension … I know he has spent several sleepless nights over this.” The latest figures from UK Finance, the umbrella body for the banking industry, shows that almost £460m was lost to APP fraud last year. While the PSR says the new rules will see “the vast majority” of money lost to these frauds reimbursed to victims, there are cases where the customer will not be refunded. This would be if they were complicit in the fraud, or “grossly negligent”. The PSR says: “Gross negligence is a high bar, and this exception does not apply to vulnerable consumers.” Law firm Farrer &amp; Co says a customer would have to show “a very significant degree of carelessness” in order to be deemed grossly negligent. However, the new rules have been criticised by some for not going far enough. Consumer group Which? says the lower £85,000 threshold could result in banks being more reticent about investing in ways to protect consumers. “Victims will still be able to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, where the maximum reimbursement amount is £430,000,” it adds. “For victims of high-value fraud, such as investment scams and house conveyancing fraud, consumers could face a lengthy battle to secure justice. “This is despite the sophistication of scams only increasing – a phenomenon that is likely to increase further due to the rise of fraudsters making use of artificial intelligence, adding to the stress and emotional harm experienced by many.” Fraud prevention service Cifas welcomes the new rules, but says there needs to be more collaboration between the PSR, law enforcement, government and other bodies dealing with the issue. In a related development which, in theory, will help protect people from APP fraud, bank payments will be able to be delayed by an extra three days if lenders suspect consumers are being scammed. Under the new powers being given to high street banks by the Treasury, payments suspected of being fraudulent may be delayed and investigated. The Treasury indicated the new rules were likely to take effect from the end of this month, though banks will need to update their terms and conditions, which could affect the implementation. The government hopes this will be another way to help tackle the spiralling level of fraud, which is now the most prevalent crime in England and Wales. Last week Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would expand a scheme to share information with banks to help guard against fraud. Its “fraud intelligence reciprocal exchange” programme, to “stop scammers and protect users”, has been working with NatWest and Metro Bank, but is now expected to bring more banks on board."

                    "bodyText": "Judges in the family courts are using victim-blaming and gender-biased language towards domestic abuse survivors, AI analysis of judgments and appeals in England and Wales reveals. The findings are the result of a project called herEthical AI, which trains computers to identify attitudes among judges that it warns is resulting in the retraumatisation of domestic abuse survivors in the family courts. Examples found through the research include characterising a woman as a “deeply troubled mother with mental health difficulties unrelated to the father’s behaviour”; referring to an attempted strangling as a possible “prank”; or concluding that it was improbable that an “educated professional” would not speak to anyone else while “inappropriate and wrong” sexual relations were happening. The idea for the project originated with a campaign called Breaking Bias run by Right to Equality. Charlotte Proudman, its founder and a barrister, said the AI model could “look through the nitty gritty to find patterns of behaviour in the language used” and reveal “stereotypical assumptions” about victims of domestic abuse, as well as a lack of understanding around coercive and controlling behaviour and how trauma impacts memory. She said the findings underscored the need for greater training on domestic abuse in family court proceedings to help rebuild low levels of public trust in the fairness of the judicial process. “There’s an attitude of disbelief – victims have reported feeling gaslit, victim-blamed, dismissed in the courtroom setting, some have described being cross examined as equivalent to being raped all over again – which is one of the most harrowing things I have heard. That’s horrendous. The courts are there to protect victims not to make it worse,” she said. One problem she identified was the “adversarial” system, which can retraumatise survivors of domestic abuse and has a “deterrent effect” on others thinking of coming forward. HerEthical AI, a startup that brings together academic experts in psychology and machine learning, along with a retired police inspector, plans to publish a journal article with its findings, as well as helping survivors make the case to be tried by a different judge or file complaints against them. So far, it has used freely available judgments and appeals, but the project is crowdfunding to buy transcripts to better understand what is going on in courts. The cost of a court transcript comes per folio, which consists of 72 words – the cheapest being 80p a folio and going up to £1.91 a folio. This is often out of reach for domestic abuse survivors, who may have taken a financial hit to leave their abuser. Hazel Sayer, a member of HerEthical AI and a research fellow specialising in gender-based violence at Bournemouth University, said this meant that family courts could be a “secretive environment, lacking accountability and transparency”. The result, according to Roda Hassan, founder of Riverlight, a nonprofit that provides advocacy services for domestic abuse survivors and is collaborating on the project, was that “at the moment there’s no real way to hold judges and magistrates accountable” for what goes on inside courtrooms, other than through “very expensive and difficult” appeals processes, requiring specialist legal knowledge which many survivors cannot afford. Riverlight has worked with survivors whose transcripts have included phrases such as “you’re a silly girl” and “you could not have been raped because you were married to him”. One woman Riverlight is working with is Sarah (not her real name), who was shocked by the attitude of her judge when she tried to claim full custody of her children after leaving an abusive relationship. She had been pushed while pregnant, and had testimony from a GP who saw the bruises as well as recordings of her partner being verbally abusive. She felt that the judge’s priority was ensuring the children would still have access to their father, even though she was frightened to leave them alone with him. “I was accused of not being child-focused by bringing up the abuse that me and the children suffered,” she recalled, adding that the judge’s attitude was “you need to put it in the past and move on”. As a result, she said, “my mental health was horrendous, I was having nightmares, I started CBT through the NHS to help me cope”. She added: “I actually doubted myself about whether I should have left because now I have to hand over my children and not be there.”"

                    "bodyText": "Apple has upgraded the iPhone 16 Pro by adding the 5x zoom camera from the big Pro Max line, making size its main differentiator and turning the smaller “pro” into an instant candidate for the best small smartphone going. The 16 Pro costs the same – £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) – as last year’s model, and sits between the £1,199 16 Pro Max and the vanilla iPhone 16, which starts at £799. That also puts it in direct competition with Google’s £999 Pixel 9 Pro, which has the same-size screen. At first glance, the 16 Pro looks just like last year’s 15 Pro, but the screen is 0.2in larger, measuring 6.3in on the diagonal. The slimmer bezels around the display have absorbed some of that growth, but the phone is still a little bigger and 12g heavier, making it roughly the same size as its predecessor in a thin case. The slick and crisp display is one of the best on the market, looking particularly good for photos and video, though it doesn’t quite hit the highest peak brightnesses offered by rivals when outdoors. The glass covering it is 50% tougher than previous iPhones, according to Apple, but the 16 Pro will still likely need a case to protect it from drops. A new camera control button has been added to the side, which you press, swipe and click to do different things such as quickly opening the camera. That brings the total number of buttons to five, including the action button added last year. The 16 Pro runs iOS 18, which adds a lot of customisation features for the home screen, control centre, updates to the Photos, Notes and Maps apps, a new password manager and RCS support for the messages app. But the much-advertised Apple Intelligence features, such as a smarter Siri, notification summaries, various AI writing tools, emoji and image generators are not yet available. They will start rolling out in beta with an iOS 18.1 update in October in the US and December for the UK, Australia and other non-US English countries, while the rest of Europe is out of luck for the foreseeable future. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A18 Pro RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 18 Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 12MP 5x zoom, 12MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm Weight: 199g New A18 Pro chip is faster and more efficient The 16 Pro has a new chip that is about 10-15% quicker with 20% faster graphics. It feels rapid in use and will stay fast for years to come. It is also about 20% more efficient staying cooler when playing high-end games. Battery life is solid for this size of phone and lasts about 38 to 40 hours between charges on mix of 5G and wifi, and actively using the screen for more than five hours. That is about the same as its predecessor and means charging it every other day or overnight for heavy use days. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles, with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The 16 Pro has repair guides available and was awarded seven out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. The 16 Pro contains more than 25% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The camera gets a big upgrade for the 16 Pro gaining parity with the Pro Max line, including the 5x optical zoom camera added to the 15 Pro Max last year and the new dedicated camera control button. The button quickly opens the camera when the phone’s screen is on. A double light-press brings up a menu to switch between adjusting the exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles or tone with swipes, before sliding your finger across the button to make the adjustments. Clicking fully down on the button takes a photo. It is really handy for quickly launching the camera and shooting photos, but using the more advanced tools felt slow and took practice to get right. The main 48-megapixel camera captures great images and now shoots at full resolution without any delay. The ultrawide camera has been upgraded from 12MP to 48MP this year, which generally improves wide angle images but provides a bigger boost to macrophotography for larger and more detailed close up images. The extended optical zoom from the 5x telephoto camera is the biggest upgrade, however, significantly closing the distance to objects with meaningful magnification. Digital zoom on top stretches to 25x magnification, with still good results up to around 10-15x. Apple has also upgraded its photographic styles feature to adjust the colour, tone and palette of photos as you capture them. Various presets are available to change the mood, such as vintage or vibrant, or adjust the undertones to make things look warmer or cooler, increase contrast and depth to shadows, or make other tweaks. Any of the styles can be modified using a virtual D-pad and an intensity slider. It is hard to be precise, but you can get really creative, such as replicating the look of particular film cameras or creating very dramatic looks. You can set a new one as default using a short guided tutorial and change the one that’s used for each photo after the fact in the photos app. Other new fun features include spatial or 3D photos, which can be viewed on headsets such as the Vision Pro. Video shot at 120 frames a second in 4K can be turned into cinematic slow motion after the fact. The new audio mix feature for video can cut out background noise or make it sound like each person in front of the camera has an individual mic, which is thoroughly impressive. Overall, the camera shoots predictably good images in a range of conditions. The photographic styles feature is great for those who want to get creative without having to develop images on a computer after the fact. The added 5x telephoto camera on the 16 Pro is a killer feature that keeps it up to par with Google’s Pixel 9 Pro. But a complete lack of AI features is noticeable, particularly compared with Google’s extremely useful “best take” and similar tools. Price The iPhone 16 Pro costs from £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 costs £799, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 9 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,249 and the Fairphone 5 costs £499. Verdict The iPhone 16 Pro strikes the best balance of size and capability with a big-enough screen and all the high-end trimmings squeezed into a relatively small frame. The addition of the 5x optical zoom brings Apple’s smaller Pro up to parity with its monster 16 Pro Max, so the choice for iPhone buyers is now simply about size and price, not capability. The faster chip and camera upgrades, such as the fun photographic styles, are welcome. The new camera control button is a mixed bag: very handy for quickly launching the camera but fiddly to use to adjust settings and difficult to press hard enough to capture an image without shaking the phone. It needs some work to be great and is not ideally placed for the left-handed. Apple’s much-advertised AI features are not available yet, and for the first time in a long while Apple has real competition from Google’s excellent Pixel 9 Pro for the best smaller phone available. It doesn’t come cheap at £200 more than the regular iPhone 16, but the 16 Pro is Apple’s best phone and at least it costs £200 less than the 16 Pro Max. Pros: relatively small and easy to hold, great cameras including 5x optical zoom, great screen, USB-C, action and camera control buttons, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: expensive, camera control a bit tricky, getting bigger and heavier, samey design as predecessors. Looking for the latest iPhone or a good deal on a refurbished handset?

The federal government was accused of throwing “small change” at the looming bird flu threat. Confidence that the Reserve Bank may soon be cutting interest rates seemed to be spreading. Brisbane’s thumping grand final triumph over Sydney was the most-watched AFL decider since 2021, we learned. The Australian share market ended the month with a fresh all-time high while the local currency is also near a 19-month high. And, with October comes the official start of the bushfire season. That’s all for now. Thank you for joining us – we’ll be back bright and early tomorrow. The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network said it is “dismayed” by the attention politicians and the media is giving to a “handful of flags” at the weekend’s Palestine and Lebanon solidarity protests, “rather than confronting Israel’s expansion of violence across the region.” APAN president Nasser Mashni said: This obsession with flags serves as a convenient distraction, allowing our leaders to continue to ignore the massacre of the people of Lebanon and Palestine, and other Arabs, and sidestep the urgent conversations about our complicity in genocide. ‘Proper regulations’ needed to protect telco customers during crises, Hanson-Young says Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says “proper regulations” are needed to protect telco customers in the event of crises. Speaking with the ABC about the Optus outage last November, she said “millions of Australians, thousands and thousands of small businesses” were failed that day. We need to make sure there’s some proper regulations about communicating where there’s a crisis. We’re asking for … requirements for telecommunication companies to share roaming ability, so if a big telco goes down, actually it’s not the consumer or the user, the member of the public, that’s left in the lurch. Transitioning between providers was possible, she said, but required regulation, direction “and some proper rules put in place”. Unrelatedly, she said she did not see any Hezbollah support at a pro-Palestinian protest in Adelaide over the weekend. “It was a very peaceful event. But it was a very sombre event,” she said. Referring to Hezbollah support seen at protests in Melbourne and Sydney over the weekend, she said distractions from well-meaning events expressing community “heartache” over the Middle East were “always frustrating”. From what I saw in Adelaide, people just want peace. They want peace and they want our government to be stronger in bringing that about. ‘Results are clear’: Sydney’s queer community does not want police to march in Mardi Gras parade Sydney’s queer community does not want the police to participate in the Mardi Gras parade, according to a report released today. Pride in Protest said that after putting pressure on Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, its organisers agreed to seek direction from the queer community earlier this year on whether the NSW police should be allowed to participate. Mardi Gras organisers ran a series of town hall meetings in August and September, with the results showing a majority of participants not wanting the police to participate in the Mardi Gras Parade, Pride in Protest said. The Mardi Gras board will now put a motion to Mardi Gras members at the 2024 AGM in December to disallow a police float in the annual parade, Pride in Protest said. Luc Velez, Pride in Protest member and Mardi Gras board director said: The qualitative and quantitative results of the consultation are clear – our community doesn’t want the police to march. The community town halls heard story after story about how queer people feel unsafe around police. People spoke about police using slurs, of them not taking sexual assault victim-survivors seriously because they were queer, and of police deliberately misgendering and deadnaming people in custody.

The 42-year-old man from Newstead also faces a four-month disqualification from driving after police stopped the Nissan X-Trail he was driving on the East Tamar Highway at Long Reach this afternoon. Tasmania police inspector Aleena Crack said: By targeting motorists travelling through roadworks we’re making sure the employees at those work sites get to go about their jobs in a safe environment. In many cases, speeding in these sorts of areas is due to driver inattention. Australia is one of the biggest markets for child exploitation material from the Philippines, with experts pushing for the government to legislate a social media duty of care to protect children from growing harm. Data from the Philippines anti-money laundering council tracing the financial origin of money paid to view child exploitation material or live streams of children being abused, placed Australia behind only the United States and United Kingdom. That backs an Australian Institute of Criminology study from 2020 which found 256 Australians had spent $1.3m over 13 years to access child abuse material from the Philippines. The Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society has spent the day hearing about the dangers of social media, and the need for regulations to protect children, in particular, from danger. That included the sexual exploitation of children, including on live streams. International Justice Mission Australia CEO, David Braga, said social media platforms remained the “easiest platform people can get access to” and more needed to be done to force the social media companies to take action. “It’s the right time to take this action,” he said. There may be other places that we then have to act again in future, but right now, people are being harmed today, easily, through these platforms. That has to stop. Braga said social media companies could use AI technology to block material before it was shown from the broadcasting end, as well as blocking it from reaching the receiver (he used the example of existing technology known as Harm Block). “We’re talking about some of the most sophisticated technology companies on the planet,” he said. It shouldn’t be beyond the realms of possibility for them to also put in place these types of controls and increasingly improve it, using the AI capability to increase the level of precision around detection and blocking it. Braga said putting a legal duty of care on social media companies (and tech companies which create devices) would move the companies to ensure their products protected children from harm. We would love to see that legal duty of care and increased penalties. And if you combine that with what I’ve already mentioned about the fact that the technology exists, they can do this. NSW police allegedly pepper-sprayed a 13-year-old child and two others after officers attempted to pull a Hezbollah flag off a protester at the Palestine-Lebanon rally in Sydney, according to legal observers. Legal observers at the rally on Sunday said police deployed pepper spray “indiscriminately” on the crowd after the protester did not surrender the flag. Waving a Hezbollah flag at a protest did not necessarily meet the threshold for arrest, according to the Australian federal police. “The mere public display of a prohibited symbol on its own does not meet the threshold of a commonwealth offence,” a spokesperson said, adding that the symbol must also be displayed alongside conduct considered to insult or intimate people to be considered an offence. The spokesperson said police have the power to direct a person to remove a prohibited symbol from public display, but they do not have the power to remove the prohibited symbol from public display themselves. However, a person can be charged for failing to comply with police officers’ directions to follow an order to remove a symbol. A number of people at the Sunday rally were holding pictures of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before the rally. The flag is considered a prohibited symbol given Australia has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organisation. A protester who spoke to Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity said the flag is viewed by some as a symbol of the liberation of southern Lebanon from the occupation of Israel. A volunteer medic who attended to the 13-year-old after they were allegedly pepper-sprayed said “the child is OK, but was definitely shaken by police violence”. “We strongly discourage the use of pepper spray by police … during protest as it’s far too easy to cause harm to attendees or bystanders,” the medic said. Adam al-Hayek, a member of Legal Observers NSW (LONSW), said: The use of OC spray at yesterday’s protest was not only harmful to children and other protesters, but was also unreasonable and without lawful justification. This pattern of unnecessary and unwarranted weapon use is reckless and a risk to public safety. Dangerous weapons have no place at protests. Guardian Australia contacted NSW police for comment. BoM model still downplays La Niña prospect but outlook looks relatively wet Whether a La Niña will form later this year in the Pacific has been a contentious matter for much of the year. Judging by the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest model run, conditions don’t point to one forming this year: To be sure, BoM has been an outlier for a while, with the US counterparts NOAA still rating the chance of a La Niña forming by November as almost a three-in-four chance (though they do have a lower bar to clear). BoM will release its fortnightly climate drivers update tomorrow, and we’ll see how those other models compare. (It’s likely the agency will retain its “La Niña Watch” status.) Meanwhile, in the Indian Ocean, BoM sees conditions tilting towards the negative dipole phase (measuring relative sea surface temperatures in that basin’s west and east), which usually means wetter than usual conditions for much of Australia. As our esteemed colleague Graham Readfearn recently reported in this article, climate change – particularly hotter seas almost everywhere – makes it harder to link, say, La Niñas with wetter than typical weather for eastern Australia. That’s why BoM prefers people heed its seasonal outlooks instead. The October-January period looks like being unusually damp, La Niña or not. That beach umbrella, in other words, may end up being dual use this summer. Middle East conflict inflaming tensions in Australian communities Staying with finance minister Katy Gallagher’s conversation with Greg Jennett on Afternoon Briefing in which the finance minister said that the escalation of conflict in the Middle East had raised tensions within Australia – and that the opposition was adding to community divides. “Things are obviously very tense in the Middle East at the moment. And we’re a large multicultural community here in Australia, with large populations of people who come from those countries or have family who live there … I think you can see that rising tension here that we’ve been seeing really for the past year, since the conflict started from October 7 onwards,” she said. I think the job for government is to continue to work on calls for unity and calm. We’re a successful multicultural nation for a reason. And, you know, we don’t need division … It’s no surprise we’ve seen Peter Dutton out again today, stoking it with calls around visa status, he’s all about stoking division and raising tensions and I guess from our point of view we want to calm tensions down. Coalition running ‘scare campaign’ over negative gearing, Gallagher says When asked about the Albanese government’s stance on negative gearing, Katy Gallagher told the ABC that she didn’t know what the opposition was “on about” in its mounting of what she called a “scare campaign”. Our policy is clear. [Jim Chalmers] said that today. It’s around supply. It is focused 100% on supply. How do we build more houses, how do we get more properties available for renting, more affordable and social housing, and our help to buy scheme, [get] more people out of renting into home ownership? That is the problem in the economy at the moment. In housing. It’s around supply of it. And you know, that’s 100% of our focus. So I don’t know what the opposition is going on about. You know, trying to run a scare campaign, essentially, around our policy which is focused on supply. Over to Afternoon Briefing, where back-to-back budget surpluses are on the agenda. A big contribution, the ABC’s Greg Jennett said, was $10bn in underspends. He asked finance minister Katy Gallagher how much of that would slide to the next year. “Some of it will be moved into the next year. And we were clear about that today,” she said. But really, the story behind the two surpluses is the work over two years. We found $80bn worth of savings in our three budgets handed down. We have returned revenue to the budget when revenue is coming in, and all of those things matter to the numbers that we delivered today … Yes, there’s some movement of funding around. And some will go into this financial year. But the two surpluses is a story of our responsible economic management. Confidence that the Reserve Bank may soon be cutting interest rates seems to be spreading (even if RBA governor Michele Bullock likes to downplay hopes lest they fan a pickup in inflation). NAB, one of the big four banks, today brought forward the timing when they think the central bank will begin easing monetary policy to February. (They had been the most pessimistic, reckoning the RBA would wait until May. NAB is now in line with ANZ and Westpac while the upbeat economists at CBA have pencilled in December – just two RBA meets away.) “[T]he balance of risks has likely shifted sufficiently for the RBA to feel comfortable cutting a little sooner than we earlier expected,” NAB said. “It remains our view that RBA cuts will be later and shallower than many peer central banks.” The US Federal Reserve slashed its key interest rate by 50 basis points a couple of weeks ago, joining counterparts in New Zealand, the UK and the European Central Bank in lowering rates in recent months. One reason for the relative slowness in Australia is that inflation didn’t rise as much here as in many other regions, and the RBA has been trying to retain job gains in the local economy since the start of the Covid pandemic. September quarter inflation figures, due out on 30 October, will probably determine when the RBA actually starts cutting interest rates. Its next board meeting follows a few days later, wrapping up on 5 November (with US presidential elections later that day, Australia time, potentially making redundant any number of predictions on interest rates or anything else). Gender pay gap in focus of feminised workforce review Disability workers, early childhood educators and health staff could be in line for a pay rise to narrow the gender pay gap, which is sitting at 11.5%, AAP reports. But any move to lift the wages in highly feminised industries would have to be gradually phased in to manage workforce and economic risks, the federal government says. The Fair Work Commission is reviewing undervalued award wages in industries with a high female workforce such as health, social work, pharmacies, disability and early childhood care. Any decision to increase award wages would have “broader implications” for workplaces and the economy, the federal government said in its submission to the commission. While the submission did not say how much the government would want wages to rise, an “orderly transition” would be needed. “Any wage increases arising from the gender-based undervaluation identified by the commission should be implemented in a measured and responsible manner that manages workforce, fiscal and macroeconomic risks,” the submission said. “If the commission concludes that pay increases are warranted, the commonwealth is likely to support a staged or phased process for implementation, particularly for any significant increases.” Thank you, as ever, Emily Wind. Let’s get on with the remainder of the day’s news. The federal government is accused of throwing “small change” at the looming bird flu threat after its own threatened species commissioner warned it could be Australia’s worst ecological disaster, AAP reports. Fiona Fraser has painted a confronting picture about what the nation can expect when the virus that’s devastated wildlife overseas arrives. She says there’ll be no avoiding mass deaths from H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza, which could arrive any day with migratory birds from the north and the south. The consequences could be grave for imperilled species including endangered Australian sea lions and Tasmanian devils, with Fraser warning it could be worse than the devastating black summer fires. Bird flu has decimated both bird and mammal species. South America has suffered extraordinary losses of marine mammals including sea lions, dolphins and otters. Over the weekend, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said planning was under way for a bird flu meeting involving environment ministers from around Australia. Plibersek did not answer AAP’s questions about when and where the meeting would be held but said it would be soon. Thanks for joining me on today’s blog! I’ll handover to Daisy Dumas, who will be with you for the remainder of the evening. Take care. Severe thunderstorm warning issued for Byron Bay and surrounds A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for parts of the northern rivers coastline in NSW, the Bureau of Meteorology says. The warning area includes Ballina, Lismore and Byron Bay, with damaging winds and large hailstones forecast over the next several hours. Pay rise peace deal for NSW firies but union fight not over An interim peace deal over pay has been struck between NSW firefighters and state officials, AAP reports, but their union warns it is not backing down on claims for a major wage increase. A stop-gap agreement for a 3% rise, backdated to February, shifts the industrial dispute to formal arbitration to resolve the parties’ outstanding issues. Some 6800 firefighters would benefit from the deal that followed a 4.5% pay rise delivered in 2023, the state government said. The Fire Brigade Employees Union is seeking a wage rise of 20% over three years to help members with cost-of-living pressures in a dispute that led to hundreds of firefighters protesting outside state parliament in March. The interim deal will mean the parties move to the Industrial Relations Commission for arbitration. Union state secretary Leighton Drury said the provisional deal did not change the broader pay demand for members. We hope that the Industrial Relations Commission and the new judges will see the worth of professional firefighters for what they do for NSW. We’re still aiming for 8, 6 and 6 [%] over three years. The NSW government has offered all public-sector workers a blanket 10.5% pay rise over three years, including a mandatory superannuation increase, well short of the figure demanded by several key unions. The pay dispute has led to mass strikes from nurses and midwives in recent weeks as their union pushes for an immediate 15% pay increase. Tomorrow’s weather forecast The Bureau of Meteorology has published a national weather forecast for tomorrow – the first day of October. Insurance industry accuses NSW of trying to roll out ‘health tax’ on policyholders Earlier today, the NSW government said private health insurers failing to pay their fair share of public hospital bed bills are costing New South Wales $140m each year (you can read more details earlier in the blog here). But as AAP reports, the industry has in turn accused the state of trying to roll out a “health tax” on policyholders to shore up an ailing hospital system. Private Healthcare Australia, an industry group, said most insurers paid a mandated federal rate for single rooms but NSW wanted a higher “preferred rate” to meet the budget revenue target. The health funds currently paying the NSW preferred rate represented about 10% of the state market, it said. Chief executive Rachel David said members of big funds, including HCF, would be forced to pay more under a higher private-insurer contribution on rooms. Some health insurance premiums could go up by $114 per year if changes were made, leading to thousands dropping out of the private system, she said. David described the push as a “secret plan to legislate a health tax”: We understand the NSW government is under significant budget pressure, but imposing a tax on people working hard to contribute to their own healthcare is not the solution. A man has been charged with commercial drug supply after police allegedly located cannabis inside his car after he hit a kangaroo in New South Wales. Officers were called to the Sturt Highway, about 25km west of Darlington Point, 1pm last Friday after a car hit a kangaroo. After inquiries, police searched the vehicle and allegedly discovered more than 44kg of cannabis leaf in the vehicle’s boot. A 30-year-old man was arrested and taken to Griffith police station where he was charged with supplying a prohibited drug in a commercial quantity. He appeared before Wagga Wagga local court on Saturday and was formally refused bail, to appear before Griffith local court today. Showers and storms forecast for parts of WA The Bureau of Meteorology says showers and storms will impact parts of northern and central Western Australia today. Severe storms may bring damaging gusts to parts of the Pilbara and Gascoyne, it said. The Queensland opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has insisted he’s the underdog, despite another poll suggesting the Labor government is in for a drubbing. A poll by the Financial Review and Freshwater Strategy this morning forecast a 56-44 two party preferred result in favour of the Liberal National party opposition, with Labor’s primary on 30 and the LNP on 43. Crisafulli was also regarded as “better premier” by more Queenslanders, 46% to 30%. He said: If you went to watch a sporting game and one team had won 11 of the last 12, you would think that side is probably the favourite, right? So let’s call it what it is – we are trying to create what, in historical terms, has been rarely done. We have to win more than a dozen seats. In an epic 52-minute press conference in Cairns on Monday, Crisafulli refused to rule out putting the Greens ahead of Labor on LNP how to vote cards. In 2020, the LNP helped kick out deputy premier Jackie Trad for Greens MP Amy McMahon by recommending preferences. The Labor party know that there is a real prospect of a larger contingent of Greens giving them preferences, giving them supply and enabling a fourth term and 14 years in office, and nothing will distract me from what would be a chaotic parliament. And I’m asking Queenslanders if they want change vote for it, both put the LNP number one. Social media in spotlight at parliamentary committee as parents share stories Hello from Canberra where the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society is holding a public hearing. It will hear from stakeholders about the impact of social media on society and democracy. (A joint select committee includes MPs from both the House of Representatives and the Senate and includes members from across the parliament.) The morning was spent mostly hearing from those involved in the media sector, including the MEAA and youth media juggernaut The Daily Aus. That part of the hearing focused on the impact of social media on news, and how designating a social media company (under the media bargaining code) may have negative impacts, by leading to social media companies just banning mainstream media from its platforms. (The argument being it wouldn’t stop people going to the platform for their news, but they wouldn’t be receiving it from trustworthy sources.) There has been a shift in the committee now, as the MPs hear from parents who have lost children to suicide and advocates for children’s mental health. They would like to see the social media age ban to apply to anyone under 18. The Heads Up Alliance, a group of parents who have formed an organisation to lobby on this point, have told the committee they want the opposition and government to go to the election with the strongest policies possible. Ali Halkic, who is appearing at the committee representing his son 17-year-old son Allem, who suicided after a cyber-bullying campaign, described social media as “a cancer that’s infesting our young children”. My son was so beautiful and confident. And he was probably vulnerable at the same time, because he was never exposed to bad words or evil or anything like that. But at the end of the day, as a parent, we have rights, and ... a lot of people won’t agree, but 16 and under, they should have no choice (to join social media). We as parents should be able to govern what we allow and what we wouldn’t allow. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Queensland LNP kick off election campaign in Cairns with youth crime announcement LNP leader David Crisafulli has kicked off the Queensland election campaign a day early with a press conference in Cairns. In an unsurprising move, today’s announcement is on youth crime. Crisafulli promised to spend $100m to fund “gold standard early intervention”. Half of the program would pay to expand local programs, designed to redirect children away from youth crime. The other half would fund international programs. Crisafulli said: I will never walk away from the need for strong laws. That is the reason we are we are. It’s a generation of untouchables, and there has been no consequences or actions, and you’ve got to set that. You’ve got to set that. But at the other end, good societies and compassionate societies, and they get a chance for people to turn their life around. The election will be held on 26 October. Asked if he was disappointed that news was leaked of Treasury looking at negative gearing and the capital gains tax, Jim Chalmers responded: It’s not really worth getting too worried about it. Asked if any housing initiatives or housing programmes were part of that underspend, Katy Gallagher responded: There is one programme and it’s relating to the remote housing. It’s essentially delays in milestones being met through the states on a remote housing programme, and a lower than expected take up of home builder. She said the decision there was $300m. Labor ‘unconvinced’ of impact on housing supply if negative gearing reforms made Circling back to negative gearing, Jim Chalmers was asked if there’s a way that changes could happen in a way that would actually boost supply? He responded that “supply is our primary consideration and that’s what has motivated the $32bn worth of initiatives that we have announced”. And one of the reasons why the changes that you’re asking me about are not part of our policy – and as the prime minister said last week – is that he is unconvinced and we are unconvinced of the impact on supply. And so overwhelmingly building more homes for Australians to make it easier for people to find somewhere to rent or buy, that is our north star here. Chalmers warns that cancelled visas possible for anyone ‘who seeks to invite discord in Australia’ Moving topics, Jim Chalmers was asked about reports of protesters waving Hezbollah flags at a pro-Palestine protest in Melbourne at the weekend – and whether he believes that warrants being disqualified for a visa on character grounds, if they are on one? He said that “any indication of support for a terrorist organisation is completely and utterly unacceptable – whether it’s Hamas or Hezbollah.” These are listed terrorist organisations, and I think any support for a terrorist organisation should and will immediately draw the attention of our security agencies. Now, there is a higher level of scrutiny for people who are on a visa, and the home affairs minister has made it really clear from day one that he will consider refusing and cancelling visas for anyone who seeks to invite discord in Australia. Jim Chalmers was asked to clarify foreign investment laws, and which country leads in terms of declined requests. He said that no specific requests were raised by his counterparts in China, where he visited recently. And in terms of knockbacks, there have been some investment bids knocked back, but they haven’t all been from one country. I think something like a bit more than 90% of bids from China have been approved. There have been some that haven’t been, but if you look at the ones that haven’t been approved, they haven’t all come from one place. Asked what areas are being knocked back versus what areas are being approved? Yeah, it’s a case by case analysis of risk. And I’ve identified in our Foreign Investment Review Board reforms the kinds of things that we are especially attentive to. No plan to ban Chinese EVs, Chalmers says Jim Chalmers is asked how confident he is that there are no security concerns about Chinese made electric vehicles, or other technologies like solar. This comes as the US banned Chinese-made EVs, and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce invoked last week’s Hezbollah members’ pager explosions in raising his concern about technology he claimed could be made with a “malevolent purpose” by a “totalitarian state”. The treasurer said “we don’t propose to ban EVs from any one country, but we do intend to continue to take advice from our relevant agencies”. And if the situation changes at some future point, then we would take that into consideration. But as Chris Bowen has said, as I have said and I’m assuming others as well, we don’t intend to do what the Americans have done. Chalmers says his job as treasurer is to seek advice on various proposals Jim Chalmers was asked if he would look at the negative gearing modelling at all? He responded: The sorts of advice that we seek from time to time is not especially unusual, especially when it comes to contentious issues. And frankly, when we’ve got housing challenge as acute as it is right now, I think it’s just doing our job – me doing my job as treasurer to seek advice on the various proposals that are in the public domain, and from time to time in the Senate. Asked about negative gearing, Chalmers says biggest housing challenge is supply A reporter asked: “People in your party and members of the caucus are eager for the government to be bold on negative gearing. Given you’re going to have some pretty schmick Treasury modelling on the subject, regardless of where it comes from, wouldn’t it be … responsible to at least keep that around, even if you’ve got a strongly-held view about your policy position?” Jim Chalmers responded: Well, we do have a strongly held view about our policy position because the primary challenge in housing right now is housing supply. And that’s why we found $32bn in three budgets, including $6bn in the last budget, to build more homes for Australians so that it’s easier to find somewhere to rent or buy. Is a third consecutive surplus completely off the cards this financial year? Jim Chalmers said a further update would be coming closer to Christmas: But even if you take that budget forecast for this year’s deficit, which is around $28bn, don’t forget the deficit for that year when we came to office was going to be $47bn. So even where we’ve got a currently forecast deficit for the third year, it is a much smaller deficit than what we inherited from the Liberals and Nationals. I’m not going to speculate about what that update might say when we release it closer to Christmas. Clearly, a $28bn deficit is hard to get rid of in one whack, but we will continue to make the right decisions for the right reasons and manage the budget and the economy in the most responsible way. Chalmers asked if surplus is justified in cost-of-living struggle A reporter asked how the government can justify a surplus when a lot of Australians are struggling to pay the bills? Jim Chalmers responded that “we don’t see a surplus as an end in itself”. You know, one of the reasons we are proud of the consecutive surpluses that we’ve delivered for the first time in almost two decades is we haven’t done that or cost of living relief. We’ve done that and cost of living relief. So we understand the pressures that people are under, we’ve deliberately ensured that we have found room for that cost-of-living relief. Katy Gallagher said the government doesn’t see “just reaching a surplus as the end game”, echoing Jim Chalmers’ sentiment from a moment ago. She said: It’s so that we can make room for the important things that people really value in the community. More housing, better Medicare services, cheaper medicines, and cost of living help when they’re doing it tough. We’ve only been able to find the room to do that because of the approach that we’ve taken in the last budget, three budgets since we came to office. Gallagher says surplus is the ‘culmination of a lot of work’ The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, was next up to speak to reporters. She described the surplus as the “culmination of a lot of work over a couple of years” through the budget: So that is finding savings, not just adding to expenditure but looking at ways that we can reprioritise spending, making ministers go back and do the hard work of looking within their departments. And they have all done that and Jim and I really appreciate the role that they have played in helping us tackle the budget mess that we inherited when we came to government. Budget surplus is due to lower spending not higher taxes, Chalmers says Jim Chalmers says the budget surplus is bigger “not because taxes are higher, but because spending is lower”. Spending in the last financial year was much lower than anticipated at budget and revenue was lower as well. Spending was down by around twice as much as revenue was down. He said the government doesn’t view a surplus as “an end in itself” but is about “fighting inflation, making room for cost-of-living relief, building a buffer against global economic uncertainty and also paying down the Liberal debt that we inherited”. Chalmers speaks to reporters about budget surplus The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media from Canberra amid news the government will deliver a $15.8bn budget surplus – more than $6bn higher than the surplus predicted at May’s federal budget. Chalmers told reporters: These are the first consecutive surpluses in almost two decades. In our first year, a $22bn surplus, which was a $100bn turnaround. In our second year, a $15.8bn surplus, which is a $72bn turnaround. That $172bn turnaround in just two years is the biggest nominal improvement in the budget in a parliamentary term ever. Deaths rise in June 2024 compared to previous year, ABS figures show ABS releases provisional deaths data for January to June The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released its provisional deaths data, for measuring changes in patterns of mortality. The data covers January to June this year, and shows: 91,319 deaths occurred between January and June 2024, 1.3% more than 2023 but 2.5% fewer than 2022. 16,855 deaths occurred in June 2024, 4.6% more than 2023 but 1.9% fewer than 2022. There were 667 deaths due to Covid-19 in June 2024, the highest number since 753 deaths in January 2023. You can read the full data online here. Hip hop group Public Enemy to reschedule Australian concert dates The hip hop group Public Enemy has announced its upcoming Australian concerts have been postponed and will be rescheduled. Their tour included shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane throughout October. Chuck D, the group’s frontman, needs to undergo immediate eye surgery and said in a statement: I’m sorry to make you wait a little longer but I need to get this eye surgery done, so I can really rock the house for you and Bring The Noise. Stay tuned for the new dates. The statement said all existing ticket holders would be notified of the new dates once confirmed, with original purchases remaining valid for the rescheduled date. Ticket holders can also request a refund. NSW’s bushfire season officially begins tomorrow Tomorrow marks the official start of the 2024-25 bushfire season in New South Wales. In a statement, the New South Wales government said high fuel loads were presenting challenges for fire agencies across the state, with the RFS responding to more than 1,600 bush and grass fires since 1 July. The minister for emergency services, Jihad Dib, encouraged people to prepare their bushfire survival plans: We have already seen dangerous fire conditions in NSW, with recent hot, dry and windy weather rapidly drying out bush and grass land areas, increasing the fire risk. With high temperatures forecast this summer, we cannot be complacent. And the commissioner of the RFS, Rob Rogers, said: Consecutive years of wet weather have fuelled growth of vegetation like grass lands, particularly west of the Great Dividing Range. Grass fires can be especially dangerous because they start quickly and spread rapidly, destroying homes and stock. Our firefighters are out on the ground doing everything they can to mitigate the risk of fire, but preparation is a shared responsibility, and we need property owners to do their part, too. The Australian share market is ending the month with a fresh all-time high, AAP reports, while the local currency is also near a 19-month high. In the first minutes of trading today, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index had climbed as high as 8,271.9, eclipsing the previous intraday record of 8,246.2 set on September 20. Just before 10.30am, the index was at 8,249.8, up 37.6 points, or 0.46%, from Friday’s close. Nine of the ASX’s 11 sectors were higher in early trading, all but consumer discretionary and telecommunications. The energy sector was the biggest gainer, up 2.0%, possibly responding to the threat of a broader Middle East war after Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. In currency, the Australian dollar was buying 69.07 US cents, from 68.86 US cents at Friday’s ASX close. The Aussie breached the 69 US cent level briefly last week, but otherwise hasn’t traded that high since February 2023. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has responded to reports of protesters waving Hezbollah flags at a pro-Palestine protest in Melbourne at the weekend. In a post to X, Wong wrote: We condemn any indication of support for a terrorist organisation such as Hizballah. It not only threatens national security, but fuels fear and division in our communities. All of us – including every political leader – must stand together to reject terrorism and extremism. AAP reported yesterday that a small group with Hezbollah flags – some holding what appeared to be framed photographs of the terror group’s slain leader Hassan Nasrallah – joined the Melbourne event as speeches ended and people began to march. Victoria police said the display of terrorist symbols was a commonwealth offence and “appropriate referrals will be made to Australian Federal Police as the lead agency concerning prohibited symbols”. Organisers of the rally told AAP the group was not affiliated with those running the demonstration. Brisbane’s thumping grand final triumph over Sydney was the most-watched AFL decider since 2021, AAP reports, but still fell well short of the benchmark set by the Matildas in their groundbreaking Women’s World Cup run last year. The Seven Network confirmed Saturday’s game had a national reach of 6.09 million and a national total TV audience of 4.024 million, including 655,000 on 7plus Sport, becoming the most-watched program of 2024. It was up more than 20,000 total TV viewers on the 2023 decider between Collingwood and Brisbane. The figure arguably reflected the fact the game was between two non-Victorian sides, attracting interest from Queensland and NSW. The 2021 audience marker (4.11 million) is a difficult one to reach as that year’s grand final between Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs occurred in Perth while many Victorians were in Covid-19 lockdowns. Saturday’s figure was also well short of the Matildas’ efforts last year. The Matildas’ semi-final against England last August broke new ground as the most-watched TV program in more than two decades. It had an average audience of 7.2 million and a reach of 11.15 million, which didn’t include viewers on partner Optus Sport. Excluding Saturday’s match, the AFL finals reached 8.5 million people, with the two preliminary finals reaching more than three million each. Four Qantas flights delayed out of Sydney amid industrial action According to AAP, one tracking website has shown four Qantas flights out of Sydney airport have been delayed so far amid this morning’s strike. However none have been delayed at Melbourne and Brisbane airports, it reports. As we flagged earlier, Qantas engineers went on strike from 7am to 9am today to secure better pay (more details earlier in the blog). Here are some photos from the strike: For more on Peta Credlin’s relationship with politics and news, since she jumped from being Tony Abbott’s chief of staff to the media in 2016, Amanda Meade had this story on the weekend: The government is recruiting a chair for SBS after the decision by George Savvides to not seek reappointment upon the completion of his second term in July 2025. Savvides has chaired the board of SBS since July 2020, before which he was deputy chair from February 2017. The minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, thanked Savvides for his service to the multicultural broadcaster. Mr Savvides is a champion of diversity and has been instrumental in positioning the SBS as a distinct, contemporary public broadcaster for today’s Australia. Under his stable leadership the SBS continues to deliver multilingual and multicultural broadcasting and digital media services reflecting our society, fostering social cohesion and celebrating and respecting Australia’s diverse way of life. Dutton weighs in on Rudd travel bill Peter Dutton was also asked about reports that taxpayers have funded $150,000 for Kevin Rudd to go on overseas trips from the US, since he was appointed Australia’s representative in Washington DC. Dutton said: I think the message needs to be sent to Kevin Rudd that his spending needs to be in check, and he needs to make sure that it’s reasonable. And at the moment, I just think clearly it’s not. Dutton was also asked if Rudd would have to look for a new job if he were elected PM. Well, Kevin Rudd’s a former prime minister, so we owe him that respect. He’s also representing our country, and I think that depends on the administration in the US at the time and the job that the ambassador’s doing. We support him being in that role and representing our country, but I think it comes with a special responsibility, particularly around expenditure. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, says an article in the Sydney Morning Herald detailing Peta Credlin and Tony Abbott’s influence over the Coalition is “not a credible story”. Speaking to 4BC Breakfast radio today, Dutton said the journalist “never contacted” him but spoke with his office, who “gave him some detail, which I’m not sure really made it into the story, but it’s not a credible story.” I’ve got a very good friendship with both Peta Credlin and Tony Abbott, but I wouldn’t have spoken to Peta Credlin twice this year. So sometimes, I think some of these journalists fill in the blanks and it’s not a credible story. I’m very proud of my friendship with Tony and Peta and Brian and others. But I make up my own decisions and I think I’ve demonstrated that I’m happy to listen to a lot of people, but in the end, you’ve got to make the decisions that you believe are in our country’s best interests. Police officers in NSW will be barred from using encrypted messaging apps and social media on work-issued devices, AAP reports. NSW police said it had introduced security software that meant “social media and other personal apps will not work or be downloadable to NSWPF issued devices”. It “provides secured access to approved NSWPF systems and applications for all users,” a NSW police spokesperson said. The move will impact about 17,000 officers who have been ordered to remove all communication software from their work-issued phones, the Daily Telegraph reported. The restriction comes after an investigation by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission into claims of a police cover-up over an officer’s car crash in Sydney’s NorthConnex tunnel in 2023. The watchdog urged NSW Police to consider whether the practice of automatically deleting electronic messages was consistent with official policy on keeping records, and to issue guidance on use of encrypted apps on work phones. After the probe, police commissioner Karen Webb referred concerns officers were using encrypted messaging services to NSW police’s public affairs branch. The Professional Standards Command was “also currently reviewing other LECC positions and opinions from that same report”, a spokesperson said. Sticking with the weather for a moment, and here are the national forecasts for Australia’s capitals, thanks to the Bureau of Meteorology: Extreme heatwave conditions in parts of Top End this week The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting extreme heatwave conditions for parts of the western Top End this week. It is forecasting maximum temperatures in the high thirties to low forties, with overnight minimum temperatures in the low to mid twenties. Severe heatwave conditions have developed over central and northern parts of the Daly district and are expected to linger for at least the next week. Locations likely to be impacted include Acacia Hills, Bark Hut, Belyuen, Berry Springs, Nauiyu, Noonamah and Litchfield National Park. Health insurers ‘sticking’ public on hospital bed costs Private health insurers failing to pay their fair share of public hospital bed bills are costing New South Wales $140m each year, the state government says. As AAP reports, the NSW government says 44 of 53 private health insurers pay their fair share of bed costs, which are government subsidised, but some large insurers unfairly profit from the system. NSW Health estimates the average hospital bed cost at $1075 a day, with some insurers contributing just $474 a hospital bed. That is despite NSW Health already charging private health insurers below cost at $892 per hospital bed a day, the government says. The NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said private insurers refusing to pay their bills robbed the public system of critical funds. Health minister Ryan Park said private insurers shifting costs to taxpayers was a “burden our health system can no longer shoulder”. We’re seeing some of the largest for-profit insurers, who enjoy billions of dollars in profit each year, sticking taxpayers with the tab. In June, the government said it reserved the right to take stronger action on the issue if it was unable to get a breakthrough with the private health funds. The problem arose after insurers withdrew from a deal struck in 2013 to pay the full bill of public hospital stays, the government says. AAP contacted the Insurance Council of Australia for comment. Commuters along the Bankstown line have been voicing their frustrations at the shift to buses while the train line is converted to a Metro service. The Bankstown to Sydenham train service has been replaced by buses for at least the next 12 months while the conversion is completed, and some travellers said that has added up to 30 minutes to their commute. Isabelle Oritz said she has had to wake up an hour earlier to get her bus into the city for her job. I’ve had to load up on coffee to get here on time. It’s super annoying, and I don’t know how I’m going to survive the year. It’s so inconvenient, and I’ve had to rearrange my life and schedule around it. There are thousands of people who are similarly being inconvenienced, all of us here are affected. Asked if she feels it’s going to be worth it, she shrugs. I hope the Metro will be quicker. Birmingham labels Wong’s UN advocacy for two-state timeline ‘a foolish idea’ Q: Penny Wong told the United Nations a few days ago she wants a timeline set for a two-state solution in the Middle East. The Coalition’s formal policy is supportive of a two-state solution, so what was wrong with her expressing that view? Simon Birmingham responded: What’s wrong is that it’s a foolish idea that creates the wrong incentives. Just having an arbitrary timeline won’t solve the problems in the Middle East. What you need are clear preconditions. Preconditions in relation to the release of the hostages Hamas still holds, the surrendering of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure, the achieving of security commitments and agreements between the two parties. Ultimately those steps and then, of course, the long-term fundamental issues that need to be resolved – agreed and secure borders, challenging issues about rights of return and citizenship rights – so just saying “we need an arbitrary timeline” isn’t going to secure peace because it leaves all of the difficult issues unresolved. Wong told the UN general assembly on Saturday that “every country in this room” must abide by the rules of war, and Israel “must comply with the binding orders of the international court of justice”. You can read more below: Birmingham demands ‘visas cancelled’ over Hezbollah flags at Sunday rallies Simon Birmingham was also asked about reports that photos of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah flags had been spotted at pro-Palestine rallies in Australia yesterday. The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has warned of visa cancellations for anyone seeking to incite “discord” in Australia. Birmingham said he “absolutely” agreed with this approach and that “the government should be going further than that.” These are despicable and reprehensible acts to see people celebrating the life of a terrorist and promoting the values or ideals of a terrorist organisation. It has no place in Australia. We should be seeing thorough investigations by the police. Those investigations should be leading to criminal charges using the laws that have been put in place to ban the promotion of terrorist propaganda and symbols and slogans, as well as seeing visas cancelled. And the government needs not to just show words in relation to this, but demonstration actions and do so swiftly. Shadow foreign minister responds to call for Hezbollah and Israel ceasefire The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, spoke with ABC News Breakfast just earlier, and was asked whether he supports calls for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. He responded that “obviously what we’re seeing are deeply troublesome times and we do wish to see a ceasefire and for peace to be achieved”. Birmingham continued: Now, how that is achieved is what matters. The statement released by the United States and other parties, including Australia, was calling for achieving … enforcement of what is known as UN security council 1701. It’s a longstanding resolution that Hezbollah has been acting continuously in breach by operating within southern Lebanon, by firing missiles and rockets into Israel continuously and this is the type of activity that precipitated Israel’s response and the conflict we’re seeing at present. If we can see those terms achieved, if we can see 1701 enforced and Hezbollah taken out of action, then that can provide a basis for a peace that we would all wish to see that can end this type of suffering. NSW police appeal for public assistance after alleged Haymarket stabbing New South Wales police are appealing for public assistance after a man was allegedly stabbed at Haymarket yesterday. Officers were told a 22-year-old man was walking near the light rail stop at Chinatown when he was allegedly stabbed in the back by another man, about 4.20pm on Sunday, who then ran away towards Darling Drive. Paramedics treated the injured man at the scene who was then taken to St Vincent’s hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police are hoping to speak to a man who may be able to assist investigators. He is described as being aged about 40 or 50, of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern or Caucasian appearance, about 170cm tall, of medium build, balding with dark hair and a short beard. He was wearing a dark top, blue or black pants with white writing on the front and white joggers. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Expert panel exploring end to native forest logging in NSW A government-appointed panel is exploring the idea of ending logging in NSW native forests within four years, AAP reports. In August, the government announced the appointment of an independent expert panel to lead consultations on what the forestry industry should look like in the future. One of five options being put to stakeholders – including industry players – is an end to native forest logging within four years, with supply to be met through other sources. That lines up with the end of existing wood supply contracts from northern forests. Stuart Blanch is WWF-Australia’s forests expert and says the inclusion of an exit option is a big deal: I think this is the first time that a NSW government process has seriously consulted stakeholders on ending native forest logging. I think this is showing there’s enough people in government and parliament who think it’s safe enough to articulate this as a real issue they need to explore. In a statement, the government said the panel had been tasked with consulting widely on the future of forestry in NSW, with its work to feed into an industry action plan. We want input on what forests and a sustainable forestry industry will look like in the next 30 years. Barnaby Joyce continues to tout ‘dangers’ of Chinese EV despite Coalition plan Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has again spoken of the “dangers” of Chinese EVs, despite Bridget McKenzie yesterday insisting that banning them in Australia wasn’t the Coalition’s plan. Speaking on Sunrise earlier this morning, Joyce repeated his argument that China could blow up solar panels and electric vehicles – invoking Israel’s detonation of communication devices in Lebanon earlier this month. Joyce said: We know with Hezbollah, Israel managed to blow up their pagers, that control of remote devices is certainly part of the new battlefield. We want to make sure Australians are safe, that we clearly disseminate where risks lie. It is not only that, we also have 200,000 solar panels on the rooftops across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. James Patterson has brought this up in the past. I want to make sure Australians are safe there. It is precautionary. The host noted that in his example, “this wasn’t China.” Joyce began responding, “Any malevolent force that has the capacity to do that …” Host: “Do you think that could happen here?” Joyce: “I’m not a moron, but I am across the threat that any cogent and proper authority says, then I don’t dismiss it. They know vastly more than I do.” Jim Chalmers was also asked on whether advice from Treasury was sought by himself on negative gearing and capital gains tax changes. He told ABC RN: I get advice all the time on all the various issues in the economy, including negative gearing, and that’s not especially unusual … Sometimes the advice comes unprompted, sometimes it’s sought by me. On this occasion, you know, when there’s a contentious issue in the public domain and we’ve got a severe shortage of housing, of course, treasurers get advice from their department on these sorts of issues, and that’s what’s happened here … I got this advice because it was a contentious issue, it was in the public domain, and it was a big part of the parliamentary debate as well. Treasurer details budget surplus Moving now to news of the $15.8bn budget surplus: Jim Chalmers was asked if this is because of under-spending by certain departments, or actual decisions since May to reduce spending? He responded: Well, the $80bn in savings are decisions. The spending restraint is a decision, and a substantial amount of the improvement since May is in demand driven programs. There is some under-spending. We’ll detail that when we release all of the figures today … The improvement from our expectations of the surplus in May to the final budget outcome that we’re reporting today is not about more revenue, it’s not about higher commodity prices, it’s not about more taxes – it’s about the less spending. Treasurer raised trade restrictions on lobsters with Chinese leaders Asked about the trade restrictions on Australian lobsters by China, Jim Chalmers said: We’ve got a bit more work to do on lobster, but I was able to convey directly to Chinese leaders that we want to see the speedy resolution of those issues. Chalmers says weakness in Chinese economy ‘big concern’ for Australia Jim Chalmers has just returned from Beijing, where he co-chaired the first Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue. The treasurer said there “couldn’t have been a more important time” to restart the dialogue with China. It’s a really important part of stabilising the relationship, which is full of complexity and full of economic opportunity. And while I was there, the Chinese authorities announced some quite substantial steps when it comes to supporting growth in the Chinese economy. We’ve made it really clear that weakness in the Chinese economy has been a big concern for us. It’s a big part of the global economic uncertainty that we’re dealing with … If you look at our Treasury forecasts in the budget, we’re anticipating the weakest few years of Chinese growth, really, since that economy opened up in the late 1970s [and] that’s been a big concern for us. We’ve been upfront about that, so any efforts to try and turn that around in China is a good thing for us. Chalmers ‘very concerned’ about escalation of conflict in the Middle East The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has been speaking with ABC RN. He was asked how concerned the government is about a broader regional conflict breaking out in the Middle East after an escalation over the weekend, with attacks from Israel on targets in Lebanon and now Yemen. Chalmers responded: Very concerned. We don’t for one second mourn the death of a leader of a terrorist organisation, but we do mourn the deaths of innocent victims, and too many innocent lives have been lost already, and that’s why we need a ceasefire so that the senseless killing of families stops. And so our primary concern here is the human cost, but obviously a broader regional war, the escalation of this very troubling regional conflict will have economic consequences as well. Replacement buses begin for T3 train line in Sydney Henry is one of the first people to take the SouthWest Link train replacement buses, and he’s pretty impressed. The buses will be running free services from Bankstown to Sydenham for over a year, as the train stations are converted to the Metro line. The recent migrant from Indonesia said he thought it was “good to see” the number of buses running on the service. Buses were arriving one after another, with services organised to be leaving Bankstown every four minutes. It’s great, if they can keep it up. It would be very convenient if it stays this consistent over the next year or so. Lambie backs changes to negative gearing for a maximum of two houses Jacqui Lambie also spoke in favour of changes to negative gearing, as one of many moves needed to address the housing crisis. She said: There’s got to be a lot of change if we’re going to put houses on the ground and we’re going to make them more affordable, there’s probably six or eight moves you have to make in this. And I believe negative gearing is one of them. And it should be maximum two houses. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie was on the Today show earlier, and was asked about news the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today reveal a $15.8bn budget surplus. Lambie weighed in on this, and said: “Nobody gives a stuff about a surplus”. She continued: Mate, I can assure you right now, people are doing it hard out there. Nobody’s talking about a surplus. And if they were, and they truly understood that, we’re saying, ‘well, how about you put some of that surplus out to us, so we can put bread and milk on the table for our kids and do that without raising the inflation.’ You know, surely with a surplus, people are really hurting out there. Honestly, give them more. Find a way to do it. AMWU head gives more detail on Qantas engineers strike The national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Steve Murphy, spoke with Sunrise earlier about the planned industrial action for Qantas engineers today. Asked why the workers were striking, he said more than 1,000 highly skilled maintenance workers had endured “four years without a wage increase.” The workers today are out on strike … for two hours. We want Qantas to come to the table and recognise the skill and contribution they make to Qantas’s reputation … These are the workers that get you there safely. We check the planes to make sure they’re when they take off everything is safe. There is no car park at 30,000 feet. They have to get everything right first time … Asked about the timing with the beginning of school holidays, Murphy said members “decided this was the most strategic time to put Qantas under pressure”. They have never been put under pressure like this before. Qantas needs to come to the table and make sure they respect their workers. Qantas workers are set to escalate industrial action as aircraft-towing engineers prepare to walk off the job during peak-hour flights to secure better pay, AAP reports. More than 1,000 engineers will stage walkouts today as union members push for a 15% rise in the first year of a new enterprise agreement, followed by 5% increases in subsequent years. Flights between 7am and 9am at major airports in Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth will “likely be affected”, the Qantas Engineers’ Alliance said in a statement yesterday. A Qantas spokesperson said that over the past four days, “we have seen no disruptions to our network as a result of the industrial action from some of our engineering workgroups.” We have contingencies in place and don’t expect Monday’s planned strike action to have an impact on customers, or their travel plans. About 1,100 aircraft maintenance workers, which is about 45% of the airline’s engineers, are covered by the agreement under negotiation. Workers have been in negotiations since April, while their enterprise agreement expired at the end of June. Qantas made a net profit of $1.25bn in the 2023-24 financial year, down 28% from the previous year. As we just flagged, the T3 train line from Bankstown to Sydenham has officially closed for Metro upgrades. Here are some photos from the scene at Bankstown station, with buses beginning to replace trains ahead of peak-hour traffic: And in other traffic news, the overnight XPT from Melbourne to Sydney is 50 minutes delayed. Good morning, and welcome to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our live coverage this Monday. The T3 train line from Bankstown to Sydenham in Sydney has officially closed today for Metro upgrades. We’ll keep an eye on any delays or impacts this morning as peak-hour traffic begins, but in the meantime, Mostafa Rachwani has the latest below: Meanwhile, Qantas workers are set to escalate industrial action as aircraft-towing engineers prepare to walk off the job during peak-hour flights to secure better pay. As AAP reports, more than 1,000 engineers will stage walkouts today as union members push for a 15% pay rise in the first year of a new enterprise agreement, followed by 5% increases in subsequent years.

                    "bodyText": "Sammy Selim strode through the dense, shiny green bushes on the slopes of his coffee farm in Sorwot village in Kericho, Kenya, accompanied by a younger farmer called Kennedy Kirui. They paused at each corner to send the farm’s coordinates to a WhatsApp conversation. The conversation was with Virtual Agronomist, a tool that uses artificial intelligence to provide fertiliser application advice using chat prompts. The chatbot asked some further questions before producing a report saying that Selim should target a yield of 7.9 tonnes and use three types of fertiliser in specific quantities to achieve that goal. “My God!” Selim said upon receipt of the report. He had planned to use much more fertiliser than Virtual Agronomist was recommending. “I could have wasted money.” In Kericho and other parts of Kenya, AI-powered tools have become increasingly popular among small-scale farmers seeking to improve the quality and quantity of their produce. Pests, diseases and a lack of technical knowhow mean farmers have become accustomed to suffering crop losses on a large scale. They used to rely on advice from agricultural extension officers – professionals deployed by local governments to provide educational services to farmers – but their numbers have declined in recent years due to inadequate funding. Selim started using Virtual Agronomist on his 0.4-hectare (1-acre) farm in 2022, with the help of another farmer who had a smartphone at the time. Following its recommendations, his farm produced 7.3 tonnes of coffee, his highest yield ever. He’s optimistic that the new recommendations will work too. “Technology helps,” he said. Before adopting Virtual Agronomist, Selim would simply apply fertiliser using what he described as “general farmer’s knowledge”, putting different types at different times of the year without knowing the soil health. The farm’s productivity was low. In one season, he managed to produce only 2.3 tonnes of coffee. At other times, he’d take samples of his soil for testing at labs far from Sorwot, but the results would take months to come back and sometimes they wouldn’t arrive at all. “A big challenge for farmers is not knowing exactly what their soil needs,” said Florah Maritim, factory manager at Sorwot Coffee Farmers Cooperative Society, which buys coffee from local farmers. The story is similar for farmers trying to determine what pests and diseases have affected their crops. Musau Mutisya, from Kwa Mwaura village in Machakos county, said he used to rely on his own knowledge to identify pests and diseases, but he wasn’t always accurate. On a recent sunny morning on his 0.6-hectare (1.5-acre) farm, he stood next to a maize plant, pointing his phone’s camera at a ragged, torn leaf using PlantVillage, an AI-powered app for diagnosing pests and diseases. A voice assistant instructed him on where to hold the phone, identified the pest as the fall armyworm, then gave him advice on how to control it. “We were doing guesswork in the past,” he said. “You’ll end up using more money treating what you don’t know.” Both tools work by training AI models on images and data. Researchers at PlantVillage fed their model thousands of images of healthy and diseased crops to help it learn how to identify pests, while for Virtual Agronomist researchers trained a model to predict PH and other soil properties using continent-wide satellite data. There are seven and a half million small-scale farmers in Kenya. But the country has an extension officer-to-farm household ratio of 1:1093, far lower than the 1:400 ratio that the Food and Agriculture Organization recommends. Farmers need information to succeed, said Enock Chikava, director for agricultural delivery systems at the Gates Foundation, which supports the nonprofit outfit iSDA that created Virtual Agronomist. Technology can help fill the gap left by the lack of extension officers, he said. “We believe in the power of digital,” Chikava said. “It can really, really disrupt things.” A report released in July by the GSM Association found that most use cases of AI in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa were in agriculture and food security. The report said the potential for the technology to support socioeconomic growth on the continent was massive, but to realise it efforts needed to be made to tackle digital skills shortages and get more smartphones in people’s hands. Both PlantVillage and Virtual Agronomist use a “lead farmer” model, whereby farmers with smartphones are trained to use the tools not only on their own farms but also on neighbouring plots. PlantVillage is free to use, as is Virtual Agronomist for all crops apart from coffee, for which it charges KSh300 (about £1.70) for advice. Despite the promise, some scientists caution about dependence on AI tools for agriculture. Angeline Wairegi, who has researched the use of the technology in agriculture in east Africa, said most AI training datasets exclude indigenous knowledge, meaning the information they provide can exclude successful localised practices. “Heavy reliance on AI tools to set farming practices may result in the erosion of long-held, and tested, indigenous agricultural practices,” said Wairegi, founder and research director at Athene Research Group. But for farmers such as Boniface Nzivo in Mua village in Machakos county, AI is a game changer. He uses a system called FarmShield to monitor temperature, humidity and soil moisture and advise him on when to water his cucumbers – aspects that he used to struggle with. “I don’t waste time trying to figure out how much water to use,” he said while inside a greenhouse for growing the plant, which needs consistent water supply. “It’s a great technology.”"

                    "bodyText": "California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Sunday vetoed a hotly contested artificial intelligence safety bill after the tech industry raised objections. Newsom said that requiring companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation. “California is home to 32 of the world’s 50 leading AI companies,” the governor said in a statement accompanying the veto. “The bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions – so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.” The Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, officially known as SB 1047, would have targeted companies developing generative AI – which can respond to prompts with fully formed text, images or audio, as well as run repetitive tasks with minimal intervention. Companies building models costing more than $100m would have been required to implement “kill switches” for their AI as well as publish plans for the testing and mitigation of extreme risks. Newsom said he had asked leading experts from the US AI Safety Institute on generative AI to help California “develop workable guardrails” that focus “on developing an empirical, science-based trajectory analysis”. He also ordered state agencies to expand their assessment of the risks from potential catastrophic events tied to AI use. Despite the veto, the governor said: “We cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public … Safety protocols must be adopted.” “While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,” Newsom wrote. “For these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.” SB 1047, written by the Democratic state senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco, included a number of protections and oversight measures including requiring companies to implement the ability to shut down the model completely in the case of emergencies, to only use the AI model for the stated purpose as well as whistleblower protections for employees looking to disclose issues with an AI system. In response to Newsom’s veto, Wiener said: “This veto leaves us with the troubling reality that companies aiming to create an extremely powerful technology face no binding restrictions from US policymakers … At the same time, the debate around SB 1047 has dramatically advanced the issue of AI safety on the international stage.” AI companies and groups allied with Silicon Valley praised Newsom’s veto. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote: “Thank you @gavinnewsom for vetoing SB1047 – for siding with California dynamism, economic growth, and freedom to compute, over safetyism, doomerism, and decline.” “We are pleased that Governor Newsom vetoed SB1047. This bill would have stifled AI innovation, hurt business growth and job creation, and broken the state’s long tradition of fostering open-source development. We support responsible AI regulations and remain committed to partnering with lawmakers to promote better approaches,” said a Meta spokesperson, Jamie Radice. The company’s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, had likewise called the bill “extremely regressive”. The California representatives Nancy Pelosi and Ro Khanna, both Democrats, had voiced their opposition to it in the weeks leading up to Newsom’s decision. Breaking with much of the tech industry, the Tesla CEO and X owner, Elon Musk, had offered measured support for the legislation, tweeting in August that “California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill,” though he said coming out in favor of it was a “tough call”. Critics of AI’s rapid growth decried the governor’s decision. Daniel Colson, the founder of AI thinktank the AI Policy Institution, called Newsom’s veto “reckless” and “out of step with the people he’s tasked with governing”. SB 1047 had come under intense criticism for how some organizations say it would affect the open-source community. The Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit that owns the developer of the Mozilla Firefox browser, previously urged Newsom to veto the bill. “Today, we see parallels to the early Internet in the AI ecosystem, which has also become increasingly closed and consolidated in the hands of a few large, tech companies,” the foundation wrote in an earlier statement. “We are concerned that SB 1047 would further this trend, harming the open-source community and making AI less safe – not more.” The bill received support from a roster of Hollywood artists, who urged Newsom to sign the bill in a letter published earlier this month. The actor Mark Ruffalo wrote in a statement: “Is this bill perfect? Nothing is. Does it set the right tone of regulating an industry that has the possibility of doing great harm as well as good? It does. It will protect society and set the groundwork for a safe AI expansion into our lives.”"

                    "bodyText": "It’s nearly two years since OpenAI released ChatGPT on an unsuspecting world, and the world, closely followed by the stock market, lost its mind. All over the place, people were wringing their hands wondering: What This Will Mean For [enter occupation, industry, business, institution]. Within academia, for example, humanities professors agonised about how they would henceforth be able to grade essays if students were using ChatGPT or similar technology to help write them. The answer, of course, is to come up with better ways of grading, because students will use these tools for the simple reason that it would be idiotic not to – just as it would be daft to do budgeting without spreadsheets. But universities are slow-moving beasts and even as I write, there are committees in many ivory towers solemnly trying to formulate “policies on AI use”. As they deliberate, though, the callous spoilsports at OpenAI have unleashed another conundrum for academia – a new type of large language model (LLM) that can – allegedly – do “reasoning”. They’ve christened it OpenAI o1, but since internally it was known as Strawberry we will stick with that. The company describes it as the first in “a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond”. They “can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math”. In a way, Strawberry and its forthcoming cousins are a response to strategies that skilled users of earlier LLMs had deployed to overcome the fact that the models were intrinsically “one-shot LLMs” – prompted with a single example to generate responses or perform tasks. The trick researchers used to improve model performance was called “chain-of-thought” prompting. This forced the model to respond to a carefully designed sequence of detailed prompts and thereby provide more sophisticated answers. What OpenAI seems to have done with Strawberry is to internalise this process. So whereas with earlier models such as GPT-4 or Claude, one would give them a prompt and they would quickly respond, with Strawberry a prompt generally produces a delay while the machine does some, er, “thinking”. This involves an internal process of coming up with a number of possible responses that are then subjected to some kind of evaluation, after which the one judged most plausible is chosen and provided to the user. As described by OpenAI, Strawberry “learns to hone its chain of thought and refine the strategies it uses. It learns to recognise and correct its mistakes. It learns to break down tricky steps into simpler ones. It learns to try a different approach when the current one isn’t working. This process dramatically improves the model’s ability to reason.” What this means is that somewhere inside the machine is a record of the “chain of thought” that led to the final output. In principle, this looks like an advance because it could reduce the opacity of LLMs – the fact that they are, essentially, black boxes. And this matters, because humanity would be crazy to entrust its future to decision-making machines whose internal processes are – by accident or corporate design – inscrutable. Frustratingly, though, OpenAI is reluctant to let users see inside the box. “We have decided,” it says, “not to show the raw chains of thought to users. We acknowledge this decision has disadvantages. We strive to partially make up for it by teaching the model to reproduce any useful ideas from the chain of thought in the answer.” Translation: Strawberry’s box is a just a slightly lighter shade of black. The new model has attracted a lot of attention because the idea of a “reasoning” machine smacks of progress towards more “intelligent” machines. But, as ever, all of these loaded terms have to be sanitised by quotation marks so that we don’t anthropomorphise the machines. They’re still just computers. Nevertheless, some people have been spooked by a few of the unexpected things that Strawberry seems capable of. Of these the most interesting was provided during OpenAI’s internal testing of the model, when its ability to do computer hacking was being explored. Researchers asked it to hack into a protected file and report on its contents. But the designers of the test made a mistake – they tried to put Strawberry in a virtual box with the protected file but they failed to notice that the file was inaccessible. According to their report, having encountered the problem, Strawberry then surveyed the computer used in the experiment, discovered a mistake in a misconfigured part of the system that it shouldn’t have been able to access, edited how the virtual boxes worked, and created a new box with the files it needed. In other words, it did what any resourceful human hacker would have done: having encountered a problem (created by a human error), it explored its software environment to find a way round it, and then took the necessary steps to accomplish the task it had been set. And it left a track that explained its reasoning. Or, to put it another way, it used its initiative. Just like a human. We could use more machines like this. What I’ve been reading Rhetoric questioned The Danger of Superhuman AI Is Not What You Think is a fabulous article by Shannon Vallor in Noema magazine on the sinister barbarism of a tech industry that talks of its creations as being “superhuman”. Guess again Benedict Evans has written an elegant piece, Asking the Wrong Questions, arguing that we don’t so much get our predictions about technology wrong as make predictions about the wrong things.

                    "bodyText": "Cosmetic surgery is back in the news. After six facelifts, a brow lift, neck lift and a lip lift, the reality star Katie Price has new “butterfly lips”, created with tape and filler that make the lips bigger and curled upwards. Price may have had more aesthetic surgery than most, but she’s not alone in going under the knife. Last year there were 35m such treatments around the world. Facial surgeries – eyelid lifts, rhinoplasties, lip fillers – rose by 20% in 2023. Whatever else is going on – pandemics, economic and political crises, wars, human rights abuses – we cling to the belief that if we fix our looks, we can improve our lives. It’s an understandable – if solipsistic – belief, given the attention paid to beautiful people; they are the ones who seem to get the jobs, the relationships, the Oscars. We are far more likely to trust, forgive and believe people who are good-looking. And if we can have a piece of that, why would we not, despite knowing some treatments end in tragedy. Last week Alice Webb, a 33-year-old mother of five, died from complications following a non-surgical “Brazilian butt lift”. Our quick-fix culture prioritises appearance over everything else, including mental health. Social media and artificial intelligence exacerbate this trend. One in three women look at Instagram influencers and feel they ought to get some work done after comparing their faces unfavourably with those created by AI. The more algorithms define “beauty”, the more they lead people to those unattainable versions. It’s a doom spiral. Not all treatments are influenced by fashion or a fear of ageing. Some 100 million people in the world live with a facial scar, mark or disease that creates “visible difference”, the term used by advocacy groups. “Disfigurement” sounds more pejorative, but it is a surgical term and a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010. Surprisingly, people with major facial injuries do not necessarily experience more psychological distress than those worried about having thin lips or acne scars. Low self-esteem linked to facial difference is entirely subjective, and mental illnesses such as body dysmorphia, are on the rise. Surgical solutions are often peddled as a short cut to cure. But there are no quick fixes, and no proof that cosmetic surgery makes us happier. On the contrary, the more treatments we have, the more we pursue; that “new you” is always just around the corner. For Price, it’s her buttocks:“‘I’ve lost weight. So… that’s the next thing to be filled. A nice, courageous [sic] plump, plum bum.” The fallacy that being more handsome or beautiful will make us happier is at the heart of A Different Man, now on US release. Directed by Aaron Schimberg, the film stars Sebastian Stan, Renate Reinsve and Adam Pearson. Pearson has neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that has covered his face in benign tumours, and he is a powerful advocate for people with visible difference. He has previously contributed to my Interface project, which explores the emotional history of the human face, from cosmetic surgery to face transplants. We meet at the King’s College Gordon Museum of Pathology in London, where, surrounded by wax teaching models of facial injury, we talk about A Different Man, and what it might reveal about our makeover culture. Stan plays Edward, a man with neurofibromatosis, the same condition as Pearson. Edward lives an unfulfilling existence – he is “plodding along”, Pearson says; “he is not unhappy but he’s also not happy”. He lives in a cramped New York apartment and appears awkward and shy, especially around his new neighbour Ingrid (Reinsve), a wannabe screenwriter who thinks she might write a play about Edward. But before that can happen, Edward “gets involved in a medical trial that ‘cures’ him”. Edward becomes a conventionally handsome man (played by Stan without his prosthetic mask). After casting off his old life, and killing off Edward, Guy rises from the ashes. He reinvents himself as a real estate agent, using his looks to sell the dream of a new life. Inside, however, nothing has changed; Guy remains awkward and insecure. When he meets Ingrid and discovers she has written a play about Edward, he auditions, with the help of a prosthetic mask. He is right for the role because, he tells Ingrid, one of his best friends has a facial difference. But it’s a role he never knew how to play, as he realises when Oswald appears, played by Pearson. In the film, as in real life, Pearson is charming and gregarious, fun to be around. He fizzes with energy and confidence, unlike Guy, who even in his beautified state moves stiltedly, like he’s afraid to take up space. Oswald takes over the play, showing how things should be done, and Guy starts to unravel. As Pearson puts it: “He sees these echoes of the past, or the past he could have had, but he couldn’t bring himself to achieve. And there follows a real descent into madness for Edward.” The crisis at the heart of the film is that Stan’s character isn’t comfortable in either of his social masks. He couldn’t thrive as Edward, either because he anticipated that others would reject him or because he had already rejected himself. Nor could he flourish as Guy, since the change was merely surface deep. In the end, the disability in The Different Man is how society treats Edward, and how he treats himself. This fits what psychologists of appearance know about the challenges of facial difference. It is easy to internalise the abuse received by others, and people with visible difference are routinely bullied and harassed, mocked and abused. Just last week it was reported that Oliver Bromley, who also has neurofibromatosis Type 1, was asked to leave a restaurant in south London because he was “scaring customers”. Those with visible difference are not helped by our historically entrenched regard for beauty, and use of facial difference as a shorthand for evil. Think GoldenEye, Skyfall, Casino Royale and Joker; or Darth Vader; Freddie Krueger and Voldemort. There have been films specifically about visible difference – Freaks (1932), The Elephant Man (1980), Open Your Eyes (1997) – but little from the perspective of the individual concerned, and virtually nothing in the past 20 years. Why these films are made, and who is involved, matters. “Is it because they have lived experience,” Pearson wonders, “or is there some kind of fascination about the whole thing; are they trying to make audiences more compassionate and empathetic, or are they going for shock value?” Pearson is open about the abuse he has experienced. When we met at King’s Cross, he had already spent the morning dealing with social media trolls. Today, with so much emphasis on cosmetic enhancement, people expect Pearson to be able to physically transform, as Edward does. That would be impossible, even if he wanted to: “All these tumours are wrapped around blood vessels and nerves, and I don’t think people realise that. People say, ‘just get surgery’, and I’m like: ‘Bruh, this is after surgery.’” There is more than one way of being socially marginalised. AI, which promises so much in terms of medical diagnosis and treatment, does not serve people with visible difference well. “Bane of my bloody life,” says Pearson. “Just reading my passport, you do it online and it says, ‘this is a bad photo’, and you say, no, this is a wonderful photo, but your software doesn’t appreciate it. I have problems with the automated booths at airports; I have to unlock my iPhone with a pin number as it won’t recognise my face.” Pearson shouldn’t have to be so resilient, but he is. Similarly, his character Oswald turns the presumptions of the viewer upside down by his seeming disregard for his condition. Oblivious to the fact that he might feel socially inadequate, Oswald goes into the world expecting to be accepted and liked. And that, psychologists of appearance say, is the only way to be – because if you are downcast or awkward, if you exhibit the timid gestures that Edward does, you invite awkwardness from others. It is true that confounding expectations makes people act differently; a lot of the time when people avoid the gaze of those who are visibly different, it is because they are uncertain how to act. What’s uncomfortable about this approach is that it puts all the work on to the person with visible difference. It requires individuals like Oswald – and by extension Pearson – to be exemplars for the “facially different community”. It’s a role that Pearson has taken on graciously, though not always one he has chosen. “When you get the ‘role model’ label thrust on you, and it does get thrust on you, sometimes people think you’re speaking for everyone. And I can only speak for myself. I care about advocacy. Whereas other people might be, ‘that’s not my job to explain it to you’. But then whose is it? Who is better equipped to do it than me? So, if me talking about it ad nauseam, until I get bored, and that means someone like me gets an easier ride, and it makes the world a better place, then rock and roll. It’s not all about me,” Pearson laughs. “It should be, but it’s not.” Critics have applauded the film’s refusal to give viewers any easy answer to the question of facial difference. I am interested in how far we can move past it, to see a person in their entirety. When Pearson is in a film that doesn’t mention visible difference, we will have evolved as a society. As I walk him to his taxi, Pearson is stared at repeatedly, and I am unsure whether it’s because of his fame, or the way he looks. He tells me that when he first met Stan, and Stan wanted to get into the role, he had said to him: “I could talk to you for ages, until the cows come home, about having a disfigurement and you’ll never, ever get it. Though, equally, what you do understand is what it’s like to be known and lose privacy that way. I’ve always said the two ways to lose your anonymity in society are either to have a disfigurement or become famous. So, I’ve kind of shafted myself on both counts. The public still thinks they own you, or that you owe them something.” Dr Fay Bound Alberti is professor of modern history at King’s College London, where she is director of Interface and the Centre for Technology and the Body.

                    "bodyText": "After nearly 25 years as a founder of Mumsnet, I considered myself pretty unshockable when it came to the workings of big tech. But my jaw hit the floor last week when I read that Google was pushing to overhaul UK copyright law in a way that would allow it to freely mine other publishers’ content for commercial gain without compensation. At Mumsnet, we’ve been on the sharp end of this practice, and have recently launched the first British legal action against the tech giant OpenAI. Earlier in the year, we became aware that it was scraping our content – presumably to train its large language model (LLM). Such scraping without permission is a breach of copyright laws and explicitly of our terms of use, so we approached OpenAI and suggested a licensing deal. After lengthy talks (and signing a non-disclosure agreement), it told us it wasn’t interested, saying it was after “less open” data sources. You might ask why the lifting of online content for model-training poses a problem – hasn’t Google been crawling all over websites and ingesting their data for search purposes since the dawn of the internet? That’s true, but there is a clear value exchange in allowing Google to access that data, namely the resulting search traffic that comes from being indexed by Google. In contrast, the LLMs are building models such as ChatGPT to provide the answers to any and all prospective questions, and that will mean people no longer need to go elsewhere for solutions. And they’re building those models with illegally scraped content from the very websites they are poised to replace. Allowing the AI companies to simply steal content isn’t just enormously unfair to publishers who see no reward for the work they put in, or the risks they take, it’s also an existential threat to them (and ultimately counterproductive). If publishers wither and die because the AIs have hoovered up all their traffic, then who’s left to produce the content to feed the models? And let’s be honest – it’s not as if these tech giants can’t afford to properly compensate publishers. OpenAI is currently fundraising to the tune of $6.5bn, the single largest venture capital round of all time, valuing the enterprise at a cool $150bn. In fact, it has just been reported that the company is planning to change its structure and become a for-profit enterprise. Some larger publishers with legal and financial muscle have managed to cut licensing deals with the AI giants, and several others are engaged in lawsuits to try to protect their rights. But the smaller publishers will be at the back of the queue and may never get compensated if Google et al have their way with copyright law. At Mumsnet, we’re actually in a stronger position than most to withstand AI’s onslaught because much of our traffic comes to us directly rather than via a search engine. An AI chatbot can spit out a “Mumsnet-style” answer to a parenting question, but they’ll never be as funny about parking wars or as brutally honest about relationships, and they’ll certainly never provide the emotional support that sees about 1,000 women a year, according to our estimates, helped to leave abusive partners by other Mumsnet users. But if these trillion-dollar giants are allowed to ride roughshod over content producers, and get away with it, they will destroy many of them, and all the jobs dependent on them. I’m not anti-AI. It plainly has the potential to advance human progress and improve our lives in myriad ways. We used it at Mumsnet to build MumsGPT, which uncovers and summarises what parents are thinking about – everything from beauty trends to supermarkets to politicians – and we licensed OpenAI’s API (application programming interface) to build it. Plus, we think there are some very good reasons why these AI models should ingest Mumsnet’s conversations to train their models. The 6bn-plus words on Mumsnet are a unique record of 24 years of female interaction about everything from global politics to relationships with in-laws. By contrast, most of the content on the web was written by and for men. AI models have misogyny baked in and we’d love to help counter their gender bias. But Google’s proposal to change our laws would allow billion-dollar companies to waltz untrammelled over any notion of a fair value exchange in the name of rapid “development”. Everything that’s unique and brilliant about smaller publisher sites would be lost, and a handful of Silicon Valley giants would be left with even more control over the world’s content and commerce. It doesn’t have to be like this – there’s more than enough money flooding into AI companies for everyone to be fairly and sustainably rewarded for their contribution. But we, and by that I mean the publishing industry and government, need to wake up and smell the coffee because, as the recent Google antitrust trial in the US showed, left to their own devices big tech companies will happily ride roughshod over the law to grow their dominance.

                    "bodyText": "OpenAI, the developer of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot, is preparing to overhaul its corporate structure and become a for-profit business. The startup’s chief executive, Sam Altman, acknowledged on Thursday that it was “not a normal company” after another surprising development at OpenAI this week when its its chief technology officer, Mira Murati, resigned. Her departure was quickly followed by the announcement that two other executives had quit. The company is synonymous with an artificial intelligence boom triggered by the emergence, in 2022, of OpenAI’s signature product, a chatbot that stunned users with its ability to craft convincing, human-like responses to an array of prompts. Altman, in turn, has become the poster child for a technology that is advancing rapidly and is being developed by the world’s largest tech companies, including Microsoft – OpenAI’s biggest backer – Google, the Facebook owner Meta and Amazon. Here, we look at some of the issues arising from the changes at OpenAI. What are the changes OpenAI is considering? The startup is considering becoming a for-profit benefit corporation – an entity that makes profits but is committed to the social and public good – that will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board, according to Reuters. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 and, in 2019, it added a profit-making subsidiary supported by Microsoft with a multibillion dollar investment. The San Francisco-based company described itself as a “partnership between our original non-profit and a new capped profit arm”. As a capped profit business, OpenAI’s for-profit unit limits the returns given to investors and employees, with the excess handed back to the nonprofit “for the benefit of humanity”. There is no cap on profit returns for a public benefit corporation. Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI, is run as a public benefit corporation. OpenAI has declined to comment on the specifics of the reported restructuring but has said the non-profit entity will “continue to exist”. Reuters also reported that the non-profit, and Altman, would own stakes in the profit-making business. Why is OpenAI considering restructuring? Developing powerful AI systems is expensive and OpenAI could be heading for a loss of as much as $5bn this year. It therefore needs more investment. The startup is in talks to raise $6.5bn from investors and removing any restriction on profits would be an extra incentive for the would-be backers engaged in talks. Potential investors include the tech company Apple and the chipmaker Nvidia. Why does it matter? OpenAI was founded with the aim of building “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), which it describes as “AI systems that are generally smarter than humans”. The AI industry has not developed AGI yet – and there is much debate over when and if AGI will arrive – but it is one of the potential breakthroughs in the technology that alarms experts, including the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk. The worry is that reckless development of AGI will unleash highly powerful systems that will evade human control. As a consequence, concerns about safety have swirled around OpenAI and have been voiced by former employees. William Saunders, a former safety researcher at the startup, said in written testimony to the US Senate that there is “a real risk they will miss important dangerous capabilities in future AI systems”. He added that he had “lost faith” in OpenAI’s ability to make responsible decisions about AGI. More generally, many experts are concerned that the tech sector – led by the likes of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Anthropic – is racing towards developing powerful AI tools and that safety could be taking a back seat. Max Tegmark, a US academic and key figure in the AI safety debate, has said he is concerned that tech firms are engaged in a “race to the bottom that must be stopped”. OpenAI says its approach is “safety at every step” and recently announced that its safety and security committee will become an independent entity. Why have so many senior executives left the company? Murati is the latest senior figure to leave OpenAI since a tumultuous few days in November last year when Altman was fired, and then reinstated, by the non-profit board. Murati said she wanted “space to do my own exploration”, as Altman expressed “tremendous gratitude” for her work. Murati had temporarily replaced Altman as chief executive last year but maintained a high-profile role at the startup, as the figurehead for the launch of its latest GPT-4o model. Altman said on Thursday that the departure of Murati, and of two other senior employees this week, was not linked to the restructuring. Other key executives have left since November. Ilya Sutskever, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, departed this year after playing a role in firing and rehiring of Altman. He was on the board that made the decision to fire Altman, but then signed a letter soon afterwards calling for his reinstatement. Other departures this year include John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI, who moved to Anthropic, and the product manager Peter Deng. Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president co-founder, also announced he was taking a sabbatical until the end of the year."

                    "bodyText": "OpenAI is reportedly pushing ahead with plans to become a for-profit company, after more senior figures left the ChatGPT developer following the surprise exit of its chief technology officer, Mira Murati. The San Francisco-based startup is preparing to change its corporate structure as it seeks $6.5bn (£4.9bn) in new funding, according to reports. Under the changes, OpenAI will become a for-profit benefit corporation – an entity that makes profits but is committed to the social and public good – that will no longer be controlled by its nonprofit board, Reuters reported. OpenAI declined to elaborate on the reports, but a spokesperson said the nonprofit entity would continue to exist. “We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we’re working with our board to ensure that we’re best positioned to succeed in our mission. The nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist,” they said. The nonprofit entity, and Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, will hold a stake in the for-profit business, Reuters reported. Altman said on Thursday that the departure of Murati and two other senior colleagues was not linked to the restructuring. “That’s totally not true,” he said. Speaking in an appearance at Italian Tech Week in Turin, he said: “We have been thinking about that [restructuring], our board has, for almost a year, independently, as we think about what it takes to get to our next stage. But I think this is just about people being ready for new chapters of their lives and a new generation of leadership.” OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 and four years later added a for-profit subsidiary, in which Microsoft is the biggest investor and whose returns to investors and employees are capped. On its website, OpenAI describes its structure as “a partnership between our original nonprofit and a new capped profit arm”. There is no cap on profits for a public benefit corporation. “The existing structure of OpenAI is quite convoluted,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school. “If they simplify their structure in some way and have a public benefit corporation as the parent company, they can make as much money as they want.” The ChatGPT developer is reportedly heading for a valuation of $150bn under the new fundraising, making it worth nearly as much as Uber. Apple and the chipmaker Nvidia are among the companies cited in reports as potential investors in the funding round. OpenAI’s progress towards its goal of creating artificial general intelligence – which it describes as “AI systems that are generally smarter than humans” – has alarmed former employees. William Saunders, a research engineer who left OpenAI this year, said he quit because he “lost faith” that it would make responsible decisions about AGI, while a former leading safety researcher at the company, Jan Leike, claimed in May that OpenAI was prioritising “shiny products” over safety. Responding to Leike’s comments on X at the time, Altman wrote: “He’s right, we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.” Reports of the corporate restructuring process, which could run into next year, came as more senior technical staff announced their departures. Murati, who was the figurehead for the May launch of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, announced on Wednesday that she was leaving. She had spent a short time as OpenAI’s temporary CEO in November last year, when Altman was fired and then reinstated by the nonprofit board. Hours later, two more colleagues, Barret Zoph and Bob McGrew, also quit, according to a post from Altman on the social media platform X. Zoph held the title of VP research, and McGrew was chief research officer. “Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership,” Altman wrote. He added that leadership changes such as Murati’s departure were a “natural part of companies”, adding: “I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company.”"

                    "bodyText": "Archaeologists using artificial intelligence (AI) have discovered hundreds of new geoglyphs depicting parrots, cats, monkeys, killer whales and even decapitated heads near the Nazca Lines in Peru, in a find that nearly doubles the number of known figures at the enigmatic 2,000-year-old archaeological site. A team from the Japanese University of Yamagata’s Nazca Institute, in collaboration with IBM Research, discovered 303 previously unknown geoglyphs of humans and animals – all smaller in size than the vast geometric patterns that date from AD200-700 and stretch across more than 400 sq km of the Nazca plateau. The new figures, which date back to 200BC, provide a new understanding of the transition from the Paracas culture to the Nazcas, who later created the iconic hummingbird, monkey and whale figures that make up part of the Unesco World Heritage site, Peru’s most popular tourist attraction after Machu Picchu. “The use of AI in research has allowed us to map the distribution of geoglyphs more quickly and accurately,” said the archaeologist Masato Sakai of Yamagata University, presenting the research at a press conference at the Japanese embassy in Lima on Monday. The use of AI combined with low-flying drones revolutionised the speed and rate at which the geoglyphs were discovered, according to a research paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The paper said while it “took nearly a century to discover a total of 430 figurative Nazca geoglyphs”, using an AI system covering the entire Nazca region it “took just six months to discover 303 new figurative geoglyphs”. The AI model efficiently spotted many of the smaller relief-type geoglyphs which were harder to see with the naked eye. It was also able to analyse vast quantities of geospatial data generated by drones to identify areas where more geoglyphs might be found. Johny Isla, Peru’s chief archaeologist for the Nazca Lines, said the use of drones and AI represented a quantum leap for archaeological study in the area. “With a drone, you can cover several kilometers in a day,” he said by phone from Nazca. “What used to take three or four years, can now be done in two or three days.” He added that the newly discovered geoglyphs were so small – between three to seven metres across – that they would not have been detected by the flyovers of the past which discovered the giant images, lines and trapezoids that crisscross Nazca’s vast desert plain. The mysterious lines that attract tens of thousands of tourists every year include a mysterious humanoid figure known as the “astronaut”, animals and vast geometric patterns including perfectly formed spirals and trapezoids which stretch for miles. The new geoglyphs also differed from Nazca culture’s vast geometric patterns and zoomorphic figures in their meaning, Isla explained. “We can say that these geoglyphs were made by humans for humans, they often show scenes from everyday life, he said. “Whereas the geoglyphs of the Nazca period are gigantic figures made on mostly flat surfaces to be seen by their gods.” The older, smaller geoglyphs could have been used as signs, he said, or represented family or kinship groups but probably lacked the ritual significance linked to water and fertility of the larger, latterly drawn lines. The new figures included large linear geoglyphs, mainly representing wild animals, but they also included gory figures showing humans holding decapitated heads, abstract humanoids and domesticated camelids, such as llamas and alpacas."

                    "headline": "Corporate America has failed to embrace DEI. An AI chatbot could be part of the solution",
                    "bodyText": "With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala Harris would be a “DEI president”.) Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets. “America and corporate America has found itself, yet again, at a cultural crossroads,” said Jeffrey L Bowman, 54, a former advertising executive who now runs his boutique consultancy Reframe AI Technologies. “This requires an entirely new playbook.” A little more than a decade ago, Bowman left his senior-level job at ad giant Ogilvy &amp; Mather to dip into his own savings and launch Reframe. The prospect was scary, but scaling down was also “quite liberating”, Bowman said. “We stay mission focused, make faster decisions and partner with brands that want to make an impact.” What he misses most about his Ogilvy &amp; Mather days, he said, are the people he used to work with. Reframe doesn’t so much view diversity as a problem to solve, but as a culture to cultivate. The work has a deeply personal component for Bowman, who grew up in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and whose career started at PepsiCo in 1990. “Over the years climbing the corporate ladder, I witnessed and experienced inequities within the practice of DEI,” he said. “I always said if I got the opportunity to modernize DEI then I would – and here we are today.” His latest effort to revamp DEI practices resulted in a new AI-powered platform. After four years of development, Bowman recently launched the Reframe small language model (SLM) – think ChatGPT, but with a DEI twist. Working with nearly a dozen engineers around the world and more than 3,000 interviews with a range of corporate leaders and employees, Bowman and his team crunched the data and used it to help clients identify their hurdles and come up with personalized strategies. The cornerstone of Bowman’s new technology is a digital “personal assistant” – a chatbot that provides instant, on-demand answers and insights. Say, for instance, a manager is struggling with how to solve a specific diversity-related challenge – such as getting employees to become more engaged with DEI programming, or determining how much money is needed to ramp up an organization’s DEI work. The digital assistant is programmed to respond with answers that take into account each user’s unique attitude and history. Despite the myriad threats that AI poses to privacy, creativity and job security, machine learning has allowed Bowman to provide his clients with more than a typical review and report of recommendations, which can sometimes feel pro forma. It has also allowed Bowman to increase his client base, despite his tiny staff (read: one full-time employee). “Previously it could take months to deliver this type of assessment to a client,” Bowman said. “Now we can complete it in a matter of days.” Reframe’s current staff is lean: in addition to Bowman and his CTO, the company employs three to four engineering contractors. Depending on project load, up to 10 software developers might be contracted. A steady client base of big-ticket companies “has allowed us to secure debt capital to cover dips in [client] payment cycles”, said Bowman, the author of two business books. Since its founding nine years ago, Reframe has worked with more than 40 Fortune 500 brands. Bowman’s team also partners with smaller companies and non-profits, such as the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the Arts &amp; Science Council of Charlotte, North Carolina. While AI is so often associated with a data-driven, depersonalized mindset, Bowman said it has brought him closer to his goal of achieving a true culture shift. Meeting numeric targets is not how he measures success. His new tool, he said, allows Reframe to “reach new business places and spaces we otherwise may not be able to reach because we are still small-sized, and still in many ways a startup”."

                    "bodyText": "The Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, presented new augmented reality glasses at the company’s annual developer conference on Wednesday, debuting a prototype of the next phase in its expansion into smart eyewear. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta AI will be able to talk in the voice of Dame Judi Dench. The glasses, named Orion, have the ability to project digital representations of media, people, games and communications on to the real world. Meta and Zuckerberg have framed the product as a step away from desktop computers and smartphone into eyewear that can perform similar tasks. “A lot of people have said this is the craziest technology they’ve ever seen,” Zuckerberg boasted during his keynote speech, clad in a shirt that read “Aut Zuck aut nihil”, Latin for “Either Zuck or nothing”, substituting his own name into a motto associated with the Roman leader Julius Caesar. A pre-recorded demonstration showed some of the glasses’ capabilities, including two people playing a virtual Pong game and talking on a video chat through augmented reality. Meta also expanded its bet on artificial intelligence, announcing a raft of new product offerings for its ChatGPT-like chatbot and plans to start automatically injecting personalized images created by the bot into people’s Facebook and Instagram feeds, as it kicked off its annual Connect conference at its California headquarters on Wednesday. Among the AI updates announced was an audio upgrade to the digital assistant, called Meta AI, which will now respond to voice commands and offer users the option to make the assistant sound like celebrities including Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell and Awkwafina. “I think that voice is going to be a way more natural way of interacting with AI than text,” Zuckerberg said. The company said more than 400 million people were using Meta AI monthly, including 185 million who were returning to it weekly. The Facebook owner also debuted an entry-level version of its Quest line of mixed-reality headsets, the Quest 3S, and is expected to preview its first augmented-reality glasses and announce updates to its existing virtual reality and AI products. In keeping with its strategy of sharing the AI models powering its digital agent for free use by others, Meta released three new versions of its Llama 3 models. Two of the models are multimodal, meaning they can understand both images and text, while the third is a basic text-only model capable of running entirely on a user’s device, a key privacy advantage. The augmented-reality reveal is a long time in the making for Zuckerberg, who positioned AR technology as a sort of magnum opus when he first pivoted the world’s biggest social media company toward building immersive “metaverse” systems in 2021. However, Meta has struggled to overcome technical challenges with its AR project since then, prompting the head of the company’s metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division to acknowledge last year that a product it could viably bring to market was “still a few years away – a few, to put it lightly”. The company has been plowing tens of billions of dollars into its investments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other metaverse technologies, driving up its capital expense forecast for 2024 to a record high of between $37bn and $40bn. The social media giant is planning for the first generation of the AR glasses this year to be distributed only internally and to a select group of developers, with each device costing tens of thousands of dollars to produce, according to a source familiar with the project. Meta aims to ship its first commercial AR glasses to consumers in 2027, by which point technical breakthroughs should bring down the cost of production, the source said. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss company plans. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the plans. In the meantime, Meta has leaned in to an unexpected interim success on the road to AR with its camera-equipped Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Riding a wave of excitement around emerging generative AI technology, the company announced at last year’s Connect conference that it was adding an AI-powered digital assistant to the glasses, turning a once-forgotten device into the most popular AI wearable on the market. Although Meta has not disclosed sales numbers for the smart glasses, the CEO of the Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica said this summer that more of the new generation sold in a few months than the old ones did in two years. The market research firm IDC estimates that more than 700,000 pairs of the glasses have shipped since the update last year. Meta recently extended its partnership with EssilorLuxottica and contemplated a possible investment in the eyewear company, prompting speculation that the AR glasses may also bear the Ray-Ban name. More immediately, Meta’s plan for the smart glasses includes plans for a next generation that will feature a viewfinder capable of displaying basic text and images through the lenses. It has been shipping software updates this year enhancing the AI assistant’s capabilities on the existing glasses, including an update in April that enabled the agent to identify and converse about objects seen by the wearer. Scheduled to hit shelves on 15 October, the Quest 3S headset will be offered in two storage capacity sizes, the smaller one priced at $299.99 and the other at $399.99. With the launch, the company is discontinuing its older Quest 2 and high-end Quest Pro devices, while also dropping the price of the more powerful Quest 3 it introduced last year from $649.99 to $499.99."

                    "bodyText": "A prominent AI artist has announced he will open the world’s first AI art museum in Los Angeles, which will highlight the “intersection of human imagination and the creative potential of machines”. The artificial intelligence art museum, dubbed Dataland, is slated to open in late 2025, in a new development next to the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Broad Museum and the home of the LA philharmonic, creating a space for AI art among some of Los Angeles’s most prestigious cultural venues. Dataland co-founder Refik Anadol, 38, is a media artist whose “crowd-pleasing – and controversial” works using artificial intelligence have been displayed around the world, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Serpentine and, most recently, the United Nations headquarters. In the past two years, Anadol has found himself at the center of debates over the value of AI-generated art, as crowds have been reportedly “transfixed” by his massive interactive digital canvases, while some art critics have panned them as over-hyped and mediocre. Now Anadol is looking to build artists like himself a permanent exhibition space among some of LA’s most prominent high-culture venues, and he is pledging that the AI art museum will promote “ethical AI” and use renewable energy sources. “LA – and California – is the right place for imagining new worlds,” Anadol said. While he is a longtime fan of the film Blade Runner, he rejected the idea that there might be anything dystopian about founding an AI art museum in the heart of Los Angeles. “This museum is utopian,” he said. With Dataland, Anadol said, he and his small team of artists and technologists hope to reinvent the museum for the artificial intelligence era, while highlighting the innovative work of digital artists, who have long been viewed with scepticism by more traditional arts establishments, as well as providing a space for ongoing scientific and technological research. He said he is trying to create a new, high-tech physical museum space, outfitting the building itself “with cloud computing and special sensors and special activities”. While he hopes to use his new museum to demystify AI, Anadol, who has worked with Google, Nvidia and other major industry players, also says that the potential of the technology is vast. “AI is not a tool. AI is beyond a tool,” he said. “Literally, in human history, we have never had intelligence as a technology.” In the wake of last year’s historic double Hollywood strike, when both writers and actors took to the picket lines with concerns over AI being used to replace human artists, Los Angeles may be one of the cities in the world where culture workers are most hostile to artificial intelligence. Anadol said that he shared some of the Hollywood artists’ concerns, and that they were also “right about” some criticisms of the AI economy. “I don’t believe machines should be the only creators. It’s a horrible future if you just let the machines do creative work,” he said. Anadol said he believed it was important for artists to build their own artificial intelligence tools, and that simply using a tool someone else had built was not enough. “I collect my own data, train my own model,” he said. “I am literally co-creating with the machine in every single step.” The museum will highlight “ethically collected” datasets, Anadol said, like his Large Nature Model, a open-source, generative AI tool built with data shared by the Smithsonian, the UK’s Natural History Museum and other prominent institutions. And, as the AI industry faces major scrutiny over the immense amount of energy it requires, Anadol said he aims to be transparent about the energy usage behind the museum’s new tools and technologies. He said he worked with Google to find a sustainable energy park in Oregon to power its AI tools without using fossil fuels, even if that means the process is slower. “Here the idea is not about being fast, or first – it’s about being right,” Anadol said. The Museum of AI Arts is starting as a for-profit venture, though Anadol said he is open to moving in a non-profit direction if the new venture can secure the patrons who would make that possible. “AI arts is a very new art form. It is barely explored. It is just starting,” he said. Not yet 40 and already exhibiting his work globally, Anadol is very much a man on the move – sometimes quite literally, as he spoke to the Guardian in part from a taxi driving through New York City on the day of the United Nations general assembly. Last year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired Anadol’s Unsupervised, a giant digital canvas that uses artificial intelligence to generate new, constantly shifting displays based on 200 years of images from Moma’s own collection. Anadol said that this was the Moma’s first acquisition of a generative AI work. Anadol, who teaches in the design department at the University of California, Los Angeles, is well connected in the LA art and museum worlds. His work is prominently featured in the Getty’s current southern California arts festival, PST: Art, and, in a recent interview before the museum announcement, the Getty’s president and CEO, Katherine Fleming, named him as “probably LA’s most famous AI artist”."

                    "bodyText": "That’s a wrap on the blog for today, but first let’s revisit the big events of the day: Australia is expected to add 7GW of renewable capacity this year. Victoria police renewed the search for the remains of missing Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy. Anthony Albanese said “we need to do more” to alleviate cost-of-living pressures. Amanda Rishworth said there was no plan to change negative gearing in housing policy after reports Labor requested modelling on options to scale back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. A bronze tribute to the Matildas was unveiled outside Suncorp stadium in Brisbane. Penny Wong called on China to play a “constructive role” at the UN. Jason Clare says a deal has been reached to fully fund Tasmanian public schools. Twelve Singaporean soldiers were injured during a training accident in Australia. The PM did not rule out negative gearing changes. The annual inflation rate fell to the lowest since 2021, at 2.7%. Macquarie took “full responsibility” after receiving a fine for ignoring suspicious trading. The BoM app tested a tsunami warning in Australia. Vanguard was hit with a record ‘greenwashing’ fine. A teenager lost his motorcycle licence 24 hours after receiving it. Outback Wrangler star Matt Wright will face a trial three years after a helicopter crash. Penny Wong warned Lebanon “cannot become the next Gaza”. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather challenged Labor to “think about what Gough Whitlam was able to do”. A Sydney man was charged for allegedly stranding his wife in Pakistan. The live news blog will be back tomorrow morning. Israeli-Australian group backs government’s move to protect aid workers, calls for ceasefire The New Israel Fund Australia, which supports a two-state solution and opposes the occupation of Palestine, says it is “deeply concerned at the continued exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah, and urges restraint from both sides to avoid further death and destruction”. Their statement released today goes on: Since Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on 8 October, life has been incredibly challenging for residents in Israel’s north who were forced to evacuate and are still living in temporary accommodation. Israel has the right to defend itself from continued rocket fire and the international community must condemn such attacks as have prior United Nations Security Council resolutions. Yet, as this war continues, innocent civilian lives are being lost. Since Israel’s bombing of Lebanon began on Monday, at least 50 children have been killed. The violence in the region has already claimed too many lives and these ongoing exchanges will only incur further bloodshed. As seen over the past year, hostages have been returned en masse only as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. So too in this latest escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, diplomacy to forge a political solution is the best path to safety and security for all. … NIF welcomes the Australian government’s efforts to protect aid workers internationally and to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza. But more must be done to ensure that no further civilian lives are lost. We call on all parties to the conflict in the region to exercise maximum restraint to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal that saves lives. ‘I am not the treasurer,’ says prime minister Anthony Albanese has unsurprisingly been quizzed on negative gearing in his media appearances this afternoon. Appearing on ABC Radio Sydney, the PM confirmed he had not asked Treasury to examine potential changes. He went on: The department, like all departments, look at various things at various times. Is this government policy or government request to examine potential policy announcement? No it’s not. Asked about the fact he’d answered the question over requesting the study on his own behalf but not about whether the treasurer had, Albanese replied: I am not the treasurer. Coalition weighs in on negative gearing rumours The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, also weighed in on negative gearing rumours on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing this afternoon. Taylor says he is not aware of any statement by Jim Chalmers or Anthony Albanese which has ruled out for ever any examination of negative gearing deductions on investment properties. Taylor says the government “have a vision of housing which is very different from ours” – because he is claiming a potential tax on housing would decrease supply: They don’t like the idea that a plumber or a carpenter should be able to buy a couple of houses and do them up and rent them out and eventually sell them to someone who wants to own the home. That is not their picture, the picture has always been for the big investment funds to own thousands of houses and that is clearly where Labor is heading right now, not just with these policies but with a range of other policies. Taylor says “you tax more of something, you get less of it”. AFP Det Acting Insp Emmanuel Tsardoulias said exit trafficking was an insidious and often underreported criminal offence. Exit trafficking can involve a person using coercion, deception or a threat, to organise or facilitate another to leave Australia. No one has the right to force or deceive anyone to leave Australia, or to prevent them from returning against their will. We want victims to know the AFP is here to help them and that their safety and wellbeing is our primary concern when we are investigating these matters. Each case is handled with compassion and great care, and the victim’s needs are always paramount. A western Sydney man has been charged for allegedly exit trafficking his wife to Pakistan using deception. A woman came to the Australian federal police (AFP) alleging her husband had left her in Pakistan without documentation after the family travelled overseas together from Australia. The 29-year-old man allegedly deceived the woman about the purpose of travel, telling her they were going to go to Pakistan to see her family. The AFP said in a statement: The woman agreed to the trip, and the man, she and their two children flew to Afghanistan in July, 2023 for a holiday, then continued to Pakistan. While travelling, it will be alleged the man retained control of the family’s tickets, passports, visas and other travel documents. The AFP will allege, after the family arrived in Pakistan, the man told the woman he was going back to Afghanistan to visit friends. However, in September 2023, the victim found out he had returned to Australia alone. The AFP worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) to ensure the woman and her children were able to safely return to Australia. During the Human Trafficking Team’s Operation Kisurra, officers executed a search warrant at the man’s Auburn home. The AFP then arrested the man today and charged him with one count of exit trafficking of a person from Australia by using deception for which the maximum penalty is 12 years’ imprisonment. The man was expected to appear before Burwood local court today. Tax system says ‘you are a mug’ if you don’t have an investment property, Eslake says One in five taxpaying Australians have an investment property, because the tax system tells us “you are a mug if you do not”, the economist Saul Eslake says. Eslake has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: Yes, there are in the sense that almost 20% of taxpaying Australians have an investment property. That is an extraordinarily high proportion by international standards – and one of the reasons why they have an investment property is Australia’s tax system, almost uniquely among developed countries, says you are a mug if you do not. If you have enough cashflow to absorb interest costs being higher than your net rental income, our tax system allows you both to defer and permanently reduce the amount of tax you would otherwise have to pay on your wage and salary or other income, and so almost a fifth of taxpaying Australians do it, which means there are a lot of votes in keeping it and there are potentially a lot of votes to be lost in arguing it should be abolished, except that opinion polls suggest a growing proportion of Australians – one suggested a majority of Australians – now see that abolishing or curtailing negative gearing might be one way, not the sole solution, but one way of addressing Australia’s growing housing crisis. Max Chandler-Mather has urged the government to “think about what Gough Whitlam was able to do” and be more ambitious in attempting “real reforms”. The Greens’ housing spokesperson has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: We need public housing and what better way to fund it than giving slightly less money to property speculators and investors and a bit more to public housing? The other element of fixing the housing crisis is the government needs to start to build public housing the way it used to, making it available to lower- and middle-income people, that’s a crucial component. We are willing to negotiate. We think that is the best outcome by phasing out this tax handouts for property investors. I’d be surprised if Labor would not want to spend that extra revenue but it has been a real struggle to get Labor to spend any money on public housing. I think that is what has left a lot of people disappointed with this Labor government. Think about what Gough Whitlam was able do – hundreds of thousands of public homes, free university education, real reforms that changed people’s lives. They should remember the values that they say they represent, and start performing in a way that Labor governments used to in the past. Chandler-Mather says the Greens want to “sit down” with the government again after the “good sign” on negative gearing: We have said we are willing to negotiate and one of those areas is movement on phasing out these tax handouts. In the space of the week the government has gone from refusing to negotiate with the Greens to cracking under pressure and are requesting Treasury modelling on phasing out negative gearing and capital gains discount, which is a good improvement from last week when they decided they would try to ram through two housing bills that would make the crisis worse. This is a good sign. Let’s sit down, be adults, look at different proposals. We have said we have a model that we took to the 2022 election. We understand Labor may not come to that model but we need some movement on those tax handouts because there are millions of people losing hope they will ever be able to buy a home, millions, not 0.2%, and they need help as well. Greens hope negative gearing reports signal ‘a government concession’ As Treasury reportedly studies a housing tax, Max Chandler-Mather says the government is “cracking under pressure from the Greens”. The Greens’ housing spokesperson has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: Hopefully this is a government concession the current position of tinkering around the edges and proposing two housing bills, that will drive up rents and house prices and potentially help no one, is not a tenable position and they are cracking under pressure from the Greens, who are pushing for a phase-out of negative gearing and capital gains tax discount.

Group sales by the outdoor equipment and surf clothing brand owner fell to NZ$979m (A$901m), with the group attributing the downturn to weak consumer confidence. On Wednesday, the KMD Brands CEO, Michael Daly, said despite Rip Curl and Oboz Footwear hitting record sales last year, all brands under the umbrella were facing headwinds due to the economic landscape. We continued to experience the effects of weakness in consumer sentiment. Sales were 11.2% below last year’s record result and decreased for all three of our brands. The New Zealand-based company reported a NZ$48m (A$44m) slump in its net profit after tax, with Kathmandu being the biggest loss contributor with a 14.5% decrease in sales. KMD Brands passed on paying shareholders a dividend this cycle and shares in the company fell 2.1% on Wednesday. Year to date, its shares have fallen 35%. Primary school students taken to hospital after accident at end of term performance Three primary school students have been taken to hospital after a piece of equipment fell during an end of term performance at a south-west Sydney public school. Guardian Australia understands the students were hit by falling lights. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Education said: Earlier today, a piece of equipment fell during an end of term performance and injured 8 Barramurra Public School students, as well as two members of the audience. The school immediately contacted emergency services and provided first aid to those injured. Three students have been transported to hospital with minor injuries, while the remaining students and audience members were treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics on-site. A spokesperson for NSW ambulance said they were called at midday with 10 people requiring ambulance assistance or assessment, including one adult and nine children. The spokesperson said the injuries of all 10 people were minor, but three children required transportation to hospital. Two were taken to Westmead hospital and one to Campbelltown. SafeWork is investigating the incident and the school is providing support to students, staff and families, the Department of Education spokesperson said. If you want to read more about exactly what happened earlier today when the Bureau of Meteorology’s app tested tsunami warnings, Daisy Dumas has the full story for you: Number of Victorians waiting for alcohol or drug treatment surges The number of Victorians waiting for some form of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment has nearly doubled since 2020, a new survey shows. The Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association’s (VAADA) seventh sector demand survey found 4,615 people were waiting for treatment on any given day, based on asking 38 service providers across the state between June and July 2024. This number is 93% higher than the September 2020 result of 2,385 people on the daily waitlist. Chris Christoforou, the chief executive of VAADA, says the increasing backlog means many are denied service at a “critical point of their help-seeking journey”. Demand for support from alcohol and other drug issues continues to rise across Victoria. Our members regularly express concerns regarding unmanageable demand for treatment in a constrained environment. The 2024 waitlist numbers demonstrate that many Victorians are denied service when they are at a critical point of their help-seeking journey, which is unsatisfactory. Christoforou said VAADA’s figures align with those released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, with this demand likely driven not only by stressors emanating from the pandemic but more broadly anxiety related to the cost of living, the lack of readily available AOD supports and the ease of access to alcohol. It is always best to invest early to reduce long-term demand and costs. This includes keeping people out of more expensive acute health and justice-related interventions. An increase in AOD capacity will result in a significant saving to the government through reducing demand at the tertiary end of the service system. Best inflation result in years but Chalmers may not get much thanks Normally a big drop in inflation would be a signal that interest rate cuts aren’t far behind. The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, though, has already told us she (and the RBA board) will look through any “temporary” price falls. By this point, Bullock is thinking government handouts take the sting out of various costs. In the case of electricity, $300 from the federal government will be spread over four instalments for every household. Queenslanders collected a neat $1,000 from 1 July, while those in Tasmania received $250 and those out west in WA got $200 (with another $200 due after 1 January.) Those rebates helped lower electricity bills by a record 17.9%, the ABS said. “Excluding the rebates, electricity prices would have risen 0.1% in August and 0.9% in July,” said Michelle Marquardt, the ABS’s head of prices statistics. As we queried in our RBA rates analysis yesterday, though, is the RBA correct that the rebates are so “temporary”? Probably yes for the states (at least in Queensland and Western Australia, which have elections soon) but what about the commonwealth? It’s hard to believe the major parties won’t offer some repeat of the rebates for the coming year at least. One other point about those lower power bills. Given the scale of the rebates, some households really will be $275 better off by 2025, as Labor promised before the May 2022. It has kept rather quiet about that promise after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent global energy markets haywire. Perhaps they might be able to say, “well, they did fall $275 after all”, at least compared with last year. Saturday Paper amends robodebt article The Saturday Paper has amended an article four days after it was condemned by its own senior reporter as an “unethical” and “misleading” defence of one of the robodebt bureaucrats. Robodebt reporter Rick Morton lambasted his editors for publishing a defence of one of the robodebt bureaucrats by columnist Christine Wallace, who had been friends with Renée Leon for 40 years. Wallace wrote that she and many public service officials believed the robodebt findings against the “widely admired former secretary of the Department of Human Services, Renée Leon” were “unjust”. Morton posted on social media that Wallace’s analysis was “garbage revisionism” and its publication a “betrayal” of the Saturday Paper’s reporting. Editor Erik Jensen has not commented on the furore. On Wednesday the website substantially amended the copy and added an editor’s note which said: “This piece was modified on September 25, 2024, to clarify the taskforce’s finding that Renée Leon misled the ombudsman.” In a strengthening of its language, the Australian government has warned that “Lebanon cannot become the next Gaza” and says “civilians are being killed by Israeli strikes”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, also called on Australian citizens in Lebanon to “leave now” and to not wait for a preferred flight route but to “take the first opportunity” to depart the country. Wong said: Civilians are being killed by Israeli strikes and it is women and children who are paying the highest price. The global community is clear, this destructive cycle must stop. All parties must show restraint and de-escalate. What has happened in recent days only makes an immediate ceasefire in Gaza even more urgent. Lebanon cannot become the next Gaza. And the violence in Gaza must end. Hostages must be released and aid must flow. Wong said she knew there were “so many people in Australia who have relatives, friends and family in Lebanon, and this is obviously a very stressful situation for them”. She said there were flight cancellations and disruptions and “there is a risk Beirut airport may close for an extended period”. Wong said: Australians in Lebanon must leave now. The AEU Tasmania president, David Genford, says unless 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) is spent on schools, governments cannot truthfully say they have funded schools according to need. The failure to deliver even the bare minimum funding required to educate most Tasmanian kids to the minimum standard is not a winning announcement. It is an abject failure of the government. This is a cloak-and-dagger deal that will rob this generation of Tasmanian children of the education funding they need. Union condemns Tasmanian school funding deal, saying it will ‘lock in inequity’ The Australian Education Union (AEU) says a joint announcement today by the Tasmanian and federal governments will fail to deliver its promised full funding to public school students and will instead “lock in inequity” across the next decade. Its federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said while details were scant, there was an estimated shortfall of almost $260m between 2024 and 2028 for Tasmanian public schools. The figure is estimated based upon a Coalition-era loophole that allows state governments to claim 4% of their required funding on things not related to school costs – such as capital depreciation and regulatory bodies. The clause remains part of the bilateral agreement agreed to today. Haythorpe says: The supposed ‘full funding deals’ that the Albanese government has struck have been shown to have fallen short of what is needed to reach 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS). This accounting trick will deny public schools up to $1,062 per year per student by 2029. This will remove $49.4m of funding from public school classrooms in Tasmania in 2024 alone, and will continue to rise every year to $54.6m in 2028, resulting in a total of almost $260m in underfunding. Three years after a tragic helicopter crash that killed his friend, Outback Wrangler Matt Wright will face trial on charges related to the accident investigation, AAP reports. After a pre-trial hearing today, the Northern Territory chief justice, Michael Grant, set an eight-week trial beginning on 7 July 2025. The Netflix television series celebrity pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice after the crash that killed co-star Chris “Willow” Wilson in 2022. The single charge relates to alleged behaviour in the aftermath of the crash in West Arnhem Land, where pilot Sebastian Robinson was also seriously injured. In the supreme court in Darwin, the senior crown prosecutor Steve Ledek said charges currently before the Darwin local court would also be added to the indictment and explored at trial. Ledek also said a surveillance device held by the prosecution has now been provided to the defence. It is expected the prosecution will call 125 witnesses. Wright’s barrister, Frank Merenda, explained a subpoena issued to the NT police commissioner, Michael Murphy, and NT police needed to be reissued after several mistakes in the legal requirements of that document. Wright’s counsel said the subpoena would be refiled in accordance with the court. The matter is scheduled for pre-trial hearing on 25 October. An 18-year-old man has lost his motorcycle licence less than 24 hours after receiving it when he was caught allegedly riding at more than 180km/h in a 90km/h zone. At about 5.45am today, police observed the Queanbeyan man overtaking a car as he entered on to the busy Monaro Highway in Canberra. He continued to accelerate, allegedly reaching a peak speed of 182km/h. When he was stopped by police, it was found the rider had held his NSW provisional licence for less than 24 hours. The motorcycle was determined to be not roadworthy due to a near bald rear tyre. His right to ride and drive in the ACT was immediately suspended and his motorcycle was seized. He was charged with driving dangerously at speed, exceeding speed of 45km/h and riding an unsafely maintained vehicle. He will face the ACT magistrates court today. Ageism remains a barrier to Australians ageing well, advocates say Elsewhere, today’s National Press Club address has been all about ageism – the stereotyping and mistreatment of people based upon age. The age discrimination commissioner, Robert Fitzgerald, and World Health Organization consultant Dr Marlene Krasovitsky have appeared together ahead of the federal government’s release of the national plan to respond to the abuse of older Australians. Krasovitsky told the room that data tells us we’re living longer, healthier lives – but ageism remains a barrier to ageing well. Ageism is pervasive. It’s acceptable, it’s normalised. And it is underpinned by powerful stereotypes and unquestioned assumptions which lead to exclusion, marginalisation and inequity. Ageism is all around us, in big structural ways, like discrimination in the workplace, or elder abuse, but also in everyday ways, like making older people feel invisible … and the way that older people are stereotyped in media and advertising. Fitzgerald said within 20 years, the population over 65 in Australia would be about nine million – double today’s figure. We have a chance to plan. We have a chance to do things differently. We have a chance to shape Australia in a way that doesn’t see ageism become the racism and sexism that’s entrenched within the Australian population today. Vanguard has been fined almost $13m after it misled investors with “greenwashing” claims for one of its investment products, according to the corporate regulator. The federal court issued the fine today after the investment manager earlier this year admitted to breaching the law by making false and misleading claims. The issue related to screens applied to its “ethically conscious” bond index fund that failed to remove exposures to various industries, including fossil fuels. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) deputy chair, Sarah Court, said: This is an important decision and the penalty imposed is the highest yet for greenwashing conduct. It is essential that companies do not misrepresent that their products or investment strategies are environmentally friendly, sustainable, or ethical. The size of the penalty should send a strong deterrent message to others in the market to carefully review any sustainable investment claims. The term “greenwashing” describes misleading claims made about a product’s environmental and sustainable credentials. Vanguard said in a statement it accepted the court’s findings. A spokesperson said: Vanguard apologises to its clients for these errors, which were unintentional. Vanguard acknowledges the importance of accurate product and marketing information in helping consumers to make informed investment decisions. Earlier this year, Mercer Super was ordered to pay an $11.3m penalty in separate greenwashing proceedings. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a media release apologising for confusion that a test tsunami warning has caused Australians and reiterating there is no threat to safety. The Bureau of Meteorology today issued test posts on the BOM Weather app between 11am and 12pm AEST. This was planned as part of the transition to new tsunami early warning system software. The Bureau acknowledges and apologises for any confusion that this test may have caused. The test warnings were sent to the BOM Weather app for various locations. The test warnings were cancelled immediately after they were issued. The BoM said testing was important to help prepare and plan for real-life tsunami threats – which, again, we do not currently have. The Bureau is part of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre (JATWC) and this is operated 24 hours a day to detect, monitor, verify and warn of any tsunami threats to the coastline of Australia and its offshore territories. The Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre is the national authority and provides the most accurate tsunami warning information for Australia. The foreign ministers of Indonesia and Solomon Islands ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in New York this morning, bringing to 73 the number of countries that have ratified it. Supporters of the treaty include 11 Pacific island states. Sierra Leone has also now ratified the TPNW. The acting director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Australia, Jemila Rushton, said it was “time for Australia to demonstrate it is serious about regional peace and security, and for Labor to make good on its promise to sign and ratify the TPNW in government”. Rushton said: Today’s ratifications reaffirm that nuclear weapons have no place in our region, or in our defence policies, and should make Australians ask why our government remains at odds with the vast majority of our neighbours. Anti-nuclear campaigners urge Australia to follow Indonesia and Solomon Islands in joining treaty Two of Australia’s nearest neighbours, Indonesia and Solomon Islands, have joined the treaty imposing a blanket ban on nuclear weapons, prompting campaigners to call on the Albanese government to follow suit. Australia would likely face pushback from the US on any moves to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. The US embassy in Canberra has previously warned that the TPNW “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. That refers to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. Prior to coming to government, Anthony Albanese championed the need for the Labor party to “take a step towards” the elimination of “the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created”. The Labor party platform says that an ALP government “will sign and ratify” the TPNW “after taking into account” three factors including the need to ensure an effective verification architecture and the need to work to achieve universal support. The Albanese government has not yet done so. In New South Wales, nine climate protesters have stopped a coal train headed to the Port of Newcastle in opposition to the federal government’s approval of three new mining projects yesterday. The protesters jumped on top of the train this morning, unfurled a banner and began shovelling coal off the top. Rising Tide, the group behind the move, said in a statement that the three projects – Whitehaven Coal’s Narrabri thermal coal project to 2066, Mach Energy’s Mount Pleasant thermal coal project to 2058 and Yancoal’s Ashton coal project to 2064 – would create 1.4bn tonnes of emissions. We are extremely outraged, and we are not going to stand for it. A spokesperson for the NSW police force confirmed that at about 10am today police were called to a rail corridor near River Road in Sandgate after reports of an unauthorised protest. Officers attached to the Newcastle city police district are now on the scene, and inquiries into the incident are ongoing. Chalmers is asked about the stage-three tax cuts, which Labor overhauled earlier this year to benefit Australians earning less than $150,000. It was decried by the Coalition as a broken promise – a line they are already pushing with negative gearing becoming, once again, a subject of debate. Labor took negative gearing reform to the 2016 and 2019 elections, but ultimately scrapped it. Chalmers says he’s proud of the changes the party made to tax cuts “because it meant that every Australian taxpayer get a tax cut, not just some”. We explained our rationale and our reasoning for that at the time … the changes to stage three at the beginning of this year meant that more people got a bigger tax cut to help with the cost of living. We are proud of what we did and we were upfront and we explained the changes that we have made, and I think the public have recognised that we are trying to do the right thing. He repeats the government has a housing policy, and negative gearing reforms are “not in it”. I could not have been clearer today. We have a housing policy, it is costing the budget $32bn … it is not unusual for governments to get advice from time to time from departments on issues which are in the public domain. On to questions, and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is asked, unexpectedly, about whether Labor is considering negative gearing ahead of the next federal election. He says the real story today is inflation, and its “substantial moderation”. We’ve got a housing policy and that is not in it. And we have made that clear today. Treasury looks at all kinds of treasury options all of the time. It is not unusual for the public service … to examine issues that are being speculated about in the public or in the parliament. That is how a good public service operates. Chalmers goes on to say “we have already got a housing policy”. We know from today’s inflation figures that we have taken some of the sting out of rents, but rents are still too high and that is because we don’t have enough homes and our motivation throughout this has been to build more homes for Australians … if our political opponents cared about housing, they would vote for our policies in the Senate but instead, in their characteristically destructive way, the Greens and the Coalition are teaming up to prevent more homes being built. More details on the trip: The main purpose is to cochair the Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue with the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission. That will happen tomorrow. Our relationship with China is full of complexity and opportunity. We recognise that a more stable economic relationship between Australia and China is a good thing for Australian workers and businesses, investors and our country more broadly. That is why just in the last week in the context of these meetings in China, I have consulted directly with the chairs, CEOs and senior executives of major China-facing Australian employers, including Rio Tinto, Wesfarmers, BHP, Woodside, Fortescue, Macquarie, Bluescope, HSBC, King &amp; Wood Mallesons, the Port of Newcastle, Sydney Airport, Cochlear, the University of New South Wales, GrainCorp, and I will also be consulting with the Business Council of Australia. We believe dialogue and engagement gives us the best chance to properly manage and maximise these really important links and our approach to China has been to cooperate where we can, disagree where we must but always engage with Australia’s national interest. The Strategic Economic Dialogue hasn’t been convened since 2017 but our government has agreed with Chinese counterparts to restart it and I will be meeting with other counterparts from the Chinese government during my two days of engagements as well. We recognise that there is a lot at stake and a lot to gain from a more stable economic relationship with China. We’ve got a big opportunity to make sure that both countries benefit from the complementarity of our economies while always protecting Australia’s national interest. Chalmers says his trip to China will be another step towards stabilising the relationship Chalmers is also giving a preview of his upcoming trip to China – the first trip by an Australian treasurer in seven years. He says the key influences slowing the economy right now are the inflation data he has been discussing today, the impact of the rate rises as well as global economic uncertainty – particularly when it comes to the Chinese economy. We’ve seen a weakness in the Chinese economy which obviously has consequences for us. We are not immune from weakness in the Chinese economy and that is why it is so important that over the next two days I will be meeting with key Chinese counterparts in Beijing. This is another really important step towards stabilising our economic relationship with China. This will be the first visit to China by an Australian treasurer in seven years. It will be part of the Albanese government’s methodical and coordinated efforts to re-establish dialogue with China, Australia’s largest trading partner. Chalmers says the Albanese government’s cost-of-living policies are “an important part of the story but not the whole story here”. We expected headline inflation to come down. We have also seen underlying inflation come down considerably as well and that is a very good thing. Our policies are a factor here but they are not the only factor. If you look at rents, they went up 6.8% in the year to August, but without increases to rent assistance, they would have increased by 8.6%. Electricity prices fell 17.9% in the year to August but without the energy rebates, they would have decreased 2.7%. But the story here goes beyond the government does make policies which are helping in the fight against inflation. Whether it is rent, energy rebates, our cost-of-living policies are an important part of the story but not the whole story here. We are seeing right across a number of measures of inflation, including underlying inflation, that it has come off considerably in the new numbers that we see today. Latest inflation figures ‘very heartening’, Chalmers says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is now also responding to inflation figures he says are “welcome” and “heartening” numbers: The new inflation numbers for August show that headline and underlying inflation both went down substantially. Headline inflation went down from 3.5% to 2.7%. This is less than half the 6.1% we inherited and it is now less than a third of its peak. Trimmed mean inflation went down from 3.8% to 3.4%, the lowest in more than 30 months. If you exclude volatile items, it went down from 3.7% to 3%. Non-tradable inflation, what others call homegrown inflation, went down from 4.5% to 3.8% and services inflation went down as well. These are very welcome, very encouraging and very heartening numbers. Taylor is blaming the last two years of the Albanese government for Australians’ standard of living being “smashed”: We have now seen six consecutive quarters of negative GDP per capita, six consecutive quarters of household recession at exactly the time when we have seen a rapid escalation in Australian households’ cost of living. They are paying much higher mortgage costs, higher prices for everything they buy and we are seeing taxes being paid at a much higher level than they were two years ago. The result of all of that is we have seen Australians’ standard of living smashed in the last two years, a disastrous outcome for Australian households and indeed around a 9% reduction in real disposable incomes in the last two years. Australia remains close to the back of the pack in dealing with our core inflation. Our core inflation is higher than every other advanced country, peer country, in the world other than the UK, and that is not one I would be wanting to compare myself with just now. Australians are no closer to seeing an interest rate cut, Taylor says The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, is responding to the monthly data released earlier today showing CPI rose 2.7% in the year to August. Taylor says Australians are no closer to seeing an interest rate cut: We need to see a sustainable reduction in prices if we are to see an interest rate cut and the restoration of standard of living for Australians that we all want to see. … Prices, on average, have risen by now 10% since Labor came to power. Ten per cent more for the average Australian household but for working families the cost of living has gone up now by over 18%. That is 18% that Australian households we know are struggling to find. And we know are also impacting the cost of doing business and we are seeing record levels of insolvencies right now. Assange to address Council of Europe in first public comments since release The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, is due to speak in public for the first time since his release from jail. Assange, who was reunited with his family when he arrived in Australia after reaching a plea deal in June, is due to fly to the French city of Strasbourg to make his first detailed public remarks. He is scheduled to address the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 1 October. The Council of Europe is an intergovernmental organisation that aims to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law. WikiLeaks said in a press release that Assange would “give testimony before the committee, which will also hear the findings that his imprisonment was politically motivated”. Assange’s wife, Stella Assange, tweeted that the event would be “an exceptional break from his recovery” because the Council of Europe had invited him to provide testimony regarding his case and its wider implications. Assange’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, also tweeted that Assange would be “addressing the public for the first time since 2019”. Pesutto reached out to Credlin for advice, defamation trial hears Victoria’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, reached out to the Sky News host Peta Credlin to provide advice to his new chief of staff in early 2023 as he attempted to “bring the party together”, the federal court has heard. Pesutto has returned to give evidence today in the federal court defamation case brought against him by the ousted Liberal MP Moira Deeming. During Pesutto’s cross-examination by Deming’s lawyer, Sue Chrysanthou SC, Pesutto said he rang Credlin in January 2023 and asked her to help his new chief of staff, Rodrigo Pintos-Lopez, to set up his office. Pesutto said he “may well have” and did not dispute the suggestion. On becoming leader, I was reaching out widely to as many in the party as I could … I recognised Mrs Credlin had served in senior roles. I was reaching out broadly to bring the party together. Pesutto said Pintos-Lopez found the meeting with Credlin “constructive”. Deeming is suing Pesutto for allegedly falsely portraying her as a Nazi sympathiser after she spoke at the Let Women Speak rally held on 18 March that was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis. Pesutto rejects this allegation. There seem to be way more smoke and vape shops. What’s going on? If you live in a major city in Australia, you have probably noticed there are a lot more tobacconists around than there used to be. Yet the smoking rate has been in constant decline, now sitting at 8.3%. So what’s going on: are there actually more smoke shops? How many? Is this due to the skyrocketing rates of vaping? And how has the government’s crackdown on vape imports affected things, if at all? Nick Evershed has the data: Labor ‘cracking under pressure’, Greens’ Chandler-Mather says The Greens are conducting a victory lap over reports that Labor will not rule out negative gearing, with its housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, arguing the party is “cracking under pressure”. The Greens last week moved to delay a vote on Labor’s housing bill, after repeatedly calling for significant changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax (CGT) discounts. Chandler-Mather says: The party of Labor landlords is cracking under pressure from the party of renters. After pretending it was impossible, all of a sudden under pressure from the Greens, millions of renters finally have some hope, as Labor is actively considering changes to negative gearing and CGT. Labor went from refusing to negotiate with the Greens on negative gearing and CGT, to actively considering changes. As it stands, Labor’s Help to Buy scheme will drive up house prices and may help no one. We’re glad to see Labor has finally come to their senses and is getting serious about working with the Greens on a housing policy that will actually tackle the scale of the crisis. Meanwhile, if you’ve seen a “test” tsunami warning for Australia on the Bureau of Meteorology app, don’t worry. They’re just testing the tsunami early warning system and, apparently, it’s working. Macquarie has responded to the fine imposed by the corporate regulator after the investment conglomerate allowed clients to conduct suspicious trades in electricity markets. A Macquarie spokesperson says: Macquarie takes full responsibility for all aspects, particularly given its important role as gatekeeper and the largest market participant facilitating clients’ activity in electricity futures in Australia and New Zealand. Macquarie has implemented remediation actions to ensure that issues with monitoring for suspicious orders are escalated and actioned appropriately and is continuing to work on areas for further improvement. As expected, electricity prices were lower, thanks to those government rebates, falling a hefty 17.9% from a year earlier. Automotive fuel also sank 7.6%. Renters, though, don’t have much relief, with the annual increase at 6.8%, modestly lower than previous months. The CPI numbers were much as expected, with the dollar and stocks not budging much. The underlying inflation rate that the RBA looks at, the trimmed mean, was 3.4%, down from 3.8% in July. That was the lowest since February 2022. Australia’s headline consumer price index has fallen to its lowest in three years, helped by government energy rebates, the ABS has just reported. The 2.7% annual rate for August was in line with economists’ expectations of 2.7% and the 3.5% annual clip in July. Read more here: Firefighters’ union accuses Ibac of ‘four-year witch hunt’ As we reported earlier today, the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) published a report uncovering five separate alleged instances where MFB employees – now working for Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) – accessed or disclosed information without authorisation between April and May 2018. It said the staffers allegedly involved were motivated to misuse MFB information to further the interests of the UFU and its secretary, Peter Marshall. But in a statement, the UFU said the report was a “four-year witch hunt”, which ultimately made no finding of corruption against the union or Marshall. The union accuses Ibac of using “deeply intrusive practices such as extended phone tapping of all phone conversations not limited to those that were work-related, physical surveillance, raids, the seizing of property including personal items and legally privileged documents, and coercive hearings”. It said Marshall was subjected to two days of examination by Ibac’s former commissioner, Robert Redlich, and “was not once presented with the accusations against him or the union and given no opportunity to answer them”. Marshall called for an investigation into Ibac itself. He said: There were regular leaks of confidential information that led to hundreds of news items since 2019. It is ironic that an organisation supposedly investigating the inappropriate use of information, took no steps to investigate the improper use of its confidential material to the media. No other coercive body has had anywhere near the same level of leaks. Macquarie fined for ignoring suspicious energy market trades Macquarie has been fined after ignoring repeated warnings from the corporate regulator that its clients were involved in suspicious trades in electricity markets, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said today. The trades occurred during a period of volatile energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Asic said that Macquarie breached market integrity rules on 50 occasions during 2022 by permitting three of its clients to place suspicious orders. The regulator said the orders may have intended to “mark the close”, which is a trading technique designed to manipulate a favourable settlement price by making a large trade shortly before the market closes. The Asic chair, Joe Longo, said: The consequences of manipulating energy markets can have a detrimental flow on impact to supplier funding costs, and in turn energy prices. This can lead to higher energy bills for consumers who are already struggling with the cost of living. The regulator said it contacted Macquarie on six occasions over concerns about volatility in energy markets or suspicious trading by its clients, but the investment bank failed to respond. It has been fined $5m. Macquarie was contacted for comment. ‘A week like no other’: AFL grand final fever is cooking in Melbourne AFL grand final fever is cooking up in Melbourne today with the city’s annual four-day Footy Festival kicking off in Yarra Park. The tourism, sport and major events minister, Steve Dimopoulos, joined the AFL CEO, Andrew Dillon, today to launch the festival. More than 250,000 fans are expected to flock to Melbourne for this week’s events. For the first time, the festival will go into the night with live music and dinner served up by signature Melbourne restaurants Easey’s, Hella Good and Pinchy’s. Dillon says: Grand final week in Victoria is a week like no other. The build-up, the anticipation, and there are plenty of activities for fans to get involved, highlighted by the free Footy Festival starting in Yarra Park and the Toyota AFL Grand Final Parade on Friday. Tasmanian school funding deal a long time coming, Wilkie says The independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie has cautiously welcomed today’s announcement that the state and federal government have reached a deal to fully fund public schools by 2029, while noting it’s been a long time coming. Since the Gonski reforms set up the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) in 2011, I have consistently advocated with successive federal governments to adopt 100% funding for public schools. However, this is only a modest investment from the federal government. They are only increasing their funding for Tasmanian public schools by 2.5% to 22.5% and requiring the state government to cover the remaining 77.5%. Moreover under the agreement, schools will still not be funded to 100% of their SRS until 2029. I’m sure most teachers and parents would hold concerns that this is far too long when our education system is struggling now. The truth is that this should have happened more than a decade ago. Young woman accused of stabbing her grandmother granted bail A young woman accused of attempted murder by stabbing her grandmother has been granted bail after her solicitor offered multiple conditions and mental health monitoring upon her release, AAP reports. The 21-year-old allegedly attacked her 63-year-old grandmother on 17 May 2023 in a home they shared in the town of Beaudesert, south of Brisbane. Bella-Rose Currie Shields has been in custody for more than 16 months, including five months in a secure mental health ward, and on Tuesday applied for bail in the supreme court in Brisbane. Justice Thomas Bradley handed down his decision on Wednesday and said the seriousness of the charge against Shields called for a large number of bail conditions. In my view, the risks associated with the applicant’s release on bail can be ameliorated to an acceptable level … she has demonstrated that her continued detention is not justified. Shields’ solicitor, Natalie Keys, had previously told Bradley her client’s mental health had improved while in custody. She’s certainly doing well. She’s obtained employment in the kitchen. It’s a position of trust using knives and that’s not done if there’s still a substantial risk. The Greens have had a not-so-subtle dig at the federal government over reports in Nine papers today that it had requested Treasury modelling on negative gearing and capital gains concessions policies. The prime minister today said the federal government intended to fix housing supply by getting its existing legislation through the Senate. But he fell short of explicitly ruling out any changes to negative gearing. Ibac uncovers ‘problematic workplace culture’ at former Metropolitan Fire Brigade in report on alleged leaks to union Victoria’s anti-corruption watchdog has uncovered a “problematic workplace culture” at the former Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB), during which confidential information was allegedly leaked to the United Firefighters Union (UFU) and its secretary, Peter Marshall. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) on Wednesday released its investigation into the allegations of leaks, dubbed Operation Turton. It uncovered five separate instances where MFB employees – now employed by Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) – allegedly accessed or disclosed information without authorisation between April and May 2018, amid the long-running firefighters dispute. This included accessing email accounts of executives and a PowerPoint presentation that the investigation stated was subsequently shared by Marshall with the then minister for emergency services, Lisa Neville. Ibac said those involved in the alleged leaking of information were “largely driven by a desire to further the interests” of UFU and its secretary: These incidents were facilitated by a workplace culture where employees did not trust management and did not believe them to be acting in the best interests of the organisation or its employees. Parts of the UFU and Marshall’s response to Ibac’s findings were included in the report. They said the report was “not suitable or appropriate to be published” and “was not realised or credible, but unsubstantiated and one-sided”. They said the incidents at the centre of the report were “trivial”. Ibac did not accept this view and made four recommendations to FRV to address what it said were “long-standing and systemic corruption risks”. Perhaps we’ll get a big core inflation drop for August, but the RBA is really holding out for the quarterly CPI figures. These land on 30 October, handily in time for the RBA’s next rates meeting on 4-5 November. After Bullock stated the board did not “explicitly” consider a rate rise this week (we think for the first time since March), markets shifted their bets. Investors reckon there’s about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut in November and about a two-in-three prospect of one in December. A “Santa” rate cut present, in other words, may yet be under that Christmas tree. Anyway, watch out for those CPI figures right here at 11.30am AEST, sharp. The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, tries to avoid “forward guidance” on where interest rates will be in the future but she doesn’t seem to mind offering a bit of statistical soothsaying. In a slightly awkward timing sequence, the RBA dropped its latest verdict on interest rates a day before the release of data on the subject the central bank is most fussed about: inflation. The ABS’s monthly consumer price index will almost certainly show a steep dive in the headline number at least. Economists expect the annual pace will slow to 2.7% from 3.5% in July. That sounds good (and would be the largest month to month decline since May 2023), bringing CPI down to its lowest since August 2021’s 2.5% rate. Expect rental price growth to slow and fuel prices to drop. The RBA, though, views the headline rate as volatile and subject to one-off or “temporary” changes, such as big energy rebates from governments. For that reason, it focuses on the “trimmed mean” or core inflation. In July that came in at 3.8% and anything lower than that (which is likely) will put it at the lowest since at least March 2022 – before the RBA rate hikes began. But the RBA wants to see that measure drop within its 2%-3% target range and look like staying there before it can confidently embark on interest rate cuts, as Bullock made clear yesterday. Albanese says the government will “take on” big businesses to tackle cost-of-living concerns, when prices are artificially deflated or increased. People out there are under financial pressure and they’re looking for value … so when they go into a supermarket and see ‘special’ or ‘prices down’ they trust that is the truth. It’s not the truth if the supermarket has increased the price by $1.50 and a month later put it down by $0.50 … that is a breach of trust, it’s a breach of faith, Australians are rightly angry about it and my government is taking action. The prime minister says it is “extraordinary” that under the Coalition there was only a voluntary code of conduct, trusting businesses to act appropriately. Asked if Albanese would rule out changes to negative gearing, he replies: What our government is considering is fixing housing supply by getting our legislation through the Senate. He refuses to confirm whether Treasury has been asked to do any modelling on it, seeming to imply they float around at whim. Treasury I’m sure do a range of proposals, policy ideas … I want a public service that is full of ideas. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking live in Launceston now, hailing a new urgent care clinic he has announced for Tasmania to avoid overcrowding emergency units at hospitals. Straight away, he is asked about those Nine reports on negative gearing. I’ve seen those reports and what we do is we value the public service … I’m sure the public service are looking at policy ideas, that’s because we value them. We have our housing policy, it’s out there for all to see … it’s currently being blocked by a No’alition of the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens. A training mishap during military drills in Australia ended with 12 Singaporean soldiers in hospital, according to Singapore’s defence ministry, which blamed the incident on an armoured vehicle that “rear-ended” another. Thousands of Singaporean troops have been dispatched to Australia for Exercise Wallaby, one of the city-state’s largest overseas training exercises. Singapore’s ministry of defence said a Hunter armoured fighting vehicle had “rear-ended another while moving back to base” at Australia’s Shoalwater Bay training facility on Tuesday night. The ministry said 12 “servicemen sustained non-serious injuries and they have been transported to the hospital”. They are currently being treated or recovering well. Singapore’s army called for a “safety pause” so that it could “remind drivers to maintain proper distance”. The unilateral war games take place under a longstanding agreement between Australia and Singapore, which lacks the landmass to train its military at scale. – AFP Schools funding deal ‘delivering for young Tasmanians’ – premier The premier of Tasmania, Jeremy Rockliff, said additional funding would flow to Tasmanian schools from 2025 – with up to $300m more funds going to the public system to the end of the decade. We have been transforming Tasmania’s education system over the past decade, and this funding partnership is the next step in delivering for young Tasmanians. The education minister, Jason Clare, described it as a “massive day” for public education in the state. This agreement means that all schools in Tasmania will be fully funded and that funding will be invested in reforms to help students catch up, keep up and finish school. I look forward to working with all states and territories to properly fund our schools and build a better and fairer education system for all Australians. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, the ACT and South Australia are still holding out for the federal government to increase their funding share by 5%, not 2.5% as is currently proposed. We’ll see if today’s decision moves the dial. PM hails ‘landmark agreement’ on Tasmania school funding Meanwhile, we have more details on the announcement this morning that Tasmania has reached an agreement with the commonwealth on school funding. Both governments have signed on to the Albanese government’s proposed funding agreement for all public schools in Tasmania to 100% of the schooling resource standard (SRS), making Tasmania the third state or territory to adopt it. Remaining states have until the end of the month to sign on, or fall back on the past agreement. Currently, the commonwealth provides 20% of the SRS for Tasmanian public schools. This will now increase to 22.5% by 2029. The Tasmanian government will increase its contribution to 77.5% of the SRS by 2029, to cover the remaining 2.5% gap. Currently, no public schools in Australia, except for schools in the ACT, are at the full and fair funding level. Anthony Albanese said he wanted to make sure that “every student in Australia, no matter where they live and learn, receives every opportunity”. Today’s landmark agreement means every public school in Tasmania will be fully and fairly funded. This is a national priority that can only delivered when the commonwealth and state and territory governments work in partnership. That’s why my government has put $16bn in extra funding for public schools on the table – the biggest ever increase in commonwealth funding to public schools. Man escapes NT custody In the Northern Territory, police are seeking public assistance to locate a 38-year-old man who escaped from correctional services. The man fled from the Alice Springs CBD about 3.20pm yesterday, NT police say. Alice Springs police are investigating his whereabouts and urging him to return to custody immediately. Treasurer hoses down negative-gearing change speculation We’re waiting for the prime minister to front a press conference in Tasmania, where he’s due to appear any minute, and where we expect he’ll get some questions about reports in the Nine newspapers that the government has asked Treasury to model potential changes to negative gearing. We’ve got in a statement from treasurer Jim Chalmers’ office, which is looking to hose down the suggestions – but doesn’t categorically rule it out of being part of future plans. “Our housing policy is clear. It doesn’t include that change,” a spokesperson for the treasurer said. We have a broad and ambitious housing agenda and we could be building more homes if it wasn’t for the divisive politics of the Greens and Coalition. Chalmers has his own press conference around midday, which we’ll also bring to you later. In big education news, the education minister, Jason Clare, has announced the federal government has reached an agreement with Tasmania to fully fund public schools. Clare is in Tasmania alongside the prime minister today, who earlier told ABC radio that education and health would be on the agenda. We will bring more details of the agreement soon, but it brings Tasmania on board with Western Australia and the Northern Territory. You can read more about the negotiations here: The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has delivered her opening remarks to a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, at the United Nations general assembly in New York. Senator Wong said the rules, norms and standards of the UN charter that both countries had committed to were “clearly under great strain”. Whether through the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the crisis in Gaza, untold deaths of civilians and aid workers, and climate change – these are just some of the threats to our security and stability … It is in all of our interests for China to play a constructive role in the international system that is inclusive and representative. We both understand the points on which we disagree won’t simply disappear if we leave them in silence. We have discussed these issues in all of our meetings, and so it will come as no surprise that today will also be an opportunity to discuss human rights, trade impediments, consular matters, the rights and freedoms of those who live in Australia, our expectations around safe and professional military conduct, and our strategic and security interests. Wong said the pair would also discuss areas of “shared cooperation and mutual benefit” – including trade and economic issues, education and the transition to net zero. Penalties toughen under NSW domestic violence laws Abusers who persistently and deliberately breach court orders meant to prevent them tormenting others will face increased penalties as part of changes to NSW domestic violence laws. Using technology to track another person’s activities has been explicitly defined as stalking, among other changes. Parents granted sole custody of a child will also be able to apply to change the child’s name. The reforms passed NSW parliament on Tuesday and are among a number of changes in recent months targeting domestic and family violence. New categories for breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders (ADVOs) have been introduced, providing for increased penalties in the case of persistent or deliberate breaches. Persistent breaches carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The order allows police to monitor high-risk offenders, and courts to impose any conditions considered appropriate to prevent them engaging in domestic abuse. It could include tightened reporting requirements, restrictions on using social media and dating apps, and notifying police when commencing a new relationship. The definition of stalking has been updated to keep pace with technology and now explicitly includes using GPS trackers or monitoring social media and other online accounts. – AAP Boy, 15, charged with murder after alleged stabbing in Melbourne shopping centre A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder following an alleged fatal stabbing at a Melbourne shopping centre yesterday. Emergency services were called to an outdoor food court at Woodgrove shopping centre, in Melton West, just before midday on Tuesday, where they located a 16-year-old from Harkness, in Melbourne’s outer west, with life threatening injuries. First responders attempted to provide CPR to the boy, but he died at the scene. Victoria Police alleged there may have been an altercation between the victim and another male who fled the scene. Investigators subsequently arrested the 15-year-old boy and he has been charged with one count of murder. He will appear at a children’s court at a later date. A permanent tribute to the Matildas’ 2023 World Cup heroics has been unveiled outside Brisbane’s Suncorp stadium. The bronze “bas relief” – a massive 5.5m x 2.1m plaque – depicts members of the Matildas celebrating the memorable quarter-final shootout victory over France. The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, said the recognition – the first permanent tribute to Australia’s women’s football side – would inspire more women and girls to get involved in football. I, like so many Australians, was on the edge of my seat watching the Matildas make us proud during the Fifa Women’s World Cup last year. Suncorp stadium was the backdrop for so many of their sensational moments throughout the tournament, including the quarter-final win over France. It’s fitting that now their success will be immortalised where the action happened. The $330,000 bas relief was announced in March. But after its unveiling, some have found the tribute underwhelming – the Matildas had initially been promised “a statue” by the previous Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. Australian’s arrest in Turkey ‘politically motivated’, Kurdish local leaders say Kurdish community leaders have told the ABC the arrest of an Australian woman in Istanbul this week was “politically motivated”, rejecting claims she had any links to terrorism. Cigdem Aslan, also known as Lenna Aslan, was detained by Turkish authorities as she tried to return home to Melbourne last week. The authorities accused her of conducting activities for the Kurdistan Workers’ party – a banned terrorist organisation in Turkey and Australia. Mahmut Kahraman, the co-president of the Kurdish Democratic Community Centre of Victoria, said Aslan had no connection to the terrorist organisation and that he believed her arrest was politically motivated. One hundred per cent lie, nothing is true. It’s definitely 100% [politically] motivated. She [is] a single mum, [she’s] a hardworking woman and she raised almost two daughters alone and she’s a multicultural health worker. [She’s] concerned about human rights … whatever [the] Turkish government [is] saying [is] totally false. She doesn’t have any connection with Kurdistan Workers’ party or any other organisations. NSW centre launches ‘police accountability dashboard’ Redfern Legal Centre has launched Australia’s first police accountability dashboard to give the public comprehensive data about the use of state police powers. The dashboard provides six years’ worth of New South Wales Police data from 2017 to 2023, with interactive statistics on strip searches, use of force and move-on directions, broken down by location, age and gender. Supervising solicitor at RLC, Samantha Lee, said the dashboard was “another step towards ensuring the use of police powers is more transparent”. Increased transparency around police powers leads to greater accountability in their use. The statistics tell a compelling story, highlighting the disproportionate use of police powers against First Nations people. It’s timely, with this important story from Catie McLeod today: Katy Perry says ‘a favourite Australian artist’ will join her in AFL grand final show Important news for Katy Perry fans and/or footy fans. Perry has just announced on Sunrise that there will be a surprise appearance during her performance at the AFL grand final on Saturday. There’s going to be a surprise performance of a favourite Australian artist that I look up to. She is going to be singing a little bit with me. I’ll be singing a little bit with her. Who could it be? Only time will tell. My bets are on Missy Higgins because she just released a [brilliant] new album and has been doing the rounds in the news. After Perry’s new album received a one star review in the Guardian and pretty much everywhere, here’s hoping her performance at the MCG is just the boost she needs. On to negative gearing, with reports in Nine Newspapers that Labor has requested modelling on options to scale back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, Rishworth said she wanted to be “really clear”. We have got a very ambitious housing policy in front of us at the moment – $32bn of investment in increasing supply in housing, and a number of policies already under way. A number that unfortunately the Coalition and the against are blocking in the Senate … it is not our proposal to address or to add negative gearing to that. We’re getting on with the job... Asked to confirm expert advice had been requested, Rishworth said: “Treasury does this sort of work. Treasury does routine work all the time around different policies, different ideas. Rishworth and Hume at odds over inflation Speaking of interest rates, the minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, appeared on Sunrise this morning alongside Jane Hume. She said the Reserve Bank’s decision was “not unexpected”. We have seen no rate hike for almost a year and it shows that we are working towards our fight on inflation. This is really, really important. And we are making sure that this absolutely our primary focus. And that’s why you have seen responsible budgeting, but also cost of living support that doesn’t add to the inflation challenge … we know people are doing it tough. That’s why we will keep working on it. Hume disagreed: It’s not imported from overseas, it is a problem with our domestic policies. And it’s sticky, meaning it’s not coming down fast enough … the government can’t just say we’re not making a problem worse. They have to tackle it head-on and particularly around tackling this growing public sector expenditure. The central bank’s good and bad news on interest rates – analysis The good news is the Reserve Bank is all but done lifting interest rates. Less good news is that the central bank is also not about to cut them. Those were probably the key takeaways from the RBA’s sixth board meeting of 2024 and the seventh since it last slugged borrowers with it’s last cash rate hike. The nine members surfaced from their figurative bunker on Tuesday afternoon to remind everyone inflation remained “too high” and “persistent”. Importantly, for the first time since March, the board did not “explicitly consider an interest rate rise” at the two-day gathering. That admission, by governor Michele Bullock, promptly sent the Australian dollar into a short swoon as investors erased lingering worries the RBA was seriously considering another a rate rise. Read more analysis on yesterday’s decision from Peter Hannam here: Coalition accuses Labor of lying over negative gearing and capital gains tax The reports have prompted a strong response from the opposition, with the opposition finance spokesperson, Jane Hume, accusing the Albanese government of “lying to the Australian people”. She told ABC News Breakfast there was “nothing wrong with the government considering anything, but lying to the Australian people about whether they’re considering it is another issue entirely”. As recently as last week, the prime minister was … saying that … questions on whether the government was considering [changes to negative gearing or capital gains tax concessions] were not very clever questions. Yet only this week, we find out there is some secret plan to look at negative gearing. On Sky News this morning, leader of the opposition in the Senate, Simon Birmingham, said the Labor government was “saying one thing on tax policy but looking at doing another”. Before the last election there were going to be no changes to stage-three tax cuts, no changes to superannuation changes, no tinkering with franking credits, yet they’ve done all of those things. Government seeking Treasury modelling on scaling back negative gearing – report With cost-of-living on the brain, a senior Labor official has told the Sydney Morning Herald that the federal government has asked Treasury for a request for modelling on options to scale back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. The expert advice could canvass changes to concessions on capital gains tax, indicating Labor may be prepared to take ambitious housing policy to the next election. The Greens have used Labor’s signature housing policy, a shared equity scheme called Help to Buy, to push for cuts to negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. But in negotiations, the government has not budged. Next on to the cost of living, the prime minister acknowledges “we need to do more” to alleviate pressure on Australians. We know people are under pressure and we know the supermarkets have been taken to court now by the ACCC for … having a lend of Australian customers, and we’ll take strong action against them. We’ve also mandated the code of conduct so customers are looked after. Finally, Albanese is again asked who he’s getting behind in the Granny. He says he has to go for Sydney. I’m actually a Hawthorn supporter, we’re a happy team at Hawthorn, we were pretty happy with the season but the Swannies, I think they’re a very good thing, they’ve been the best team all year. Funding standoff over Tasmania schools in focus as Jason Clare visits Albanese says the education minister, Jason Clare, is also in Tasmania today to discuss getting the state’s schools to 100% of school funding. He expects negotiations will be “really positive” with the state government. The Tasmanian government is yet to sign up to the commonwealth’s proposal to increase public school funding by 2.5% – holding out for a 5% increase to 25% alongside Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. When I checked in with the state’s education minister, Jo Palmer, last week, she said the government was “investing more than ever before in education” and the federal government needed to “do more to support our students”. We want to continue negotiations with the commonwealth in good faith and we continue to seek funding of the school resourcing standard to 100%. It’ll be interesting to see if the standoff changes today. PM says $120m for Tasmania heart centre is part of strengthening health sector Over in northern Tasmania, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is appearing on ABC Radio regarding his announcement today of a $120m investment into a local heart centre. It shouldn’t be the case that if you’re in northern Tasmania and you need this sort of assistance you need to cross the Bass Strait and go to Melbourne. He says the government wants to “strengthen Medicare and strengthen the health sector” by taking pressure off emergency departments with specialised urgent care clinics. If you get early treatment, you can save money as well as save lives. Matt Canavan cites Katy Perry in swipe at Greens Nationals senator Matt Canavan has had a dig at both pop stars and political parties on breakfast TV this morning, declaring “Katy Perry would do a better job running our economy than the Greens”. Canavan was on to discuss the Reserve Bank’s decision to hold interest rates steady yesterday, with the Greens urging the treasurer to overrule the decision and bring rates down. I think Katy Perry would do a better job running our economy than the Greens. I mean, this is just insane. Like, I mean, there’s fundamental problems here and people understand that … people know that times are quite tough and all of us have had to tighten our own belts and sacrifice things because of that … It’s not easy to tell people, but in tough times there are no easy solutions. Asked what Canavan was most excited to hear at Perry’s AFL grand final performance this weekend, he replied: “Roar is the only Katy Perry song I know, so I wouldn’t say I love it. I probably won’t be screaming at top of my lungs if she sings it, but … bring over Oasis, that’s who I want to see. Queensland Labor backs new student accommodation at university Meanwhile, in Queensland, the state’s deputy premier and treasurer, Cameron Dick, will front the media today to announce the Labor government’s support for a new 1,000-bed student accommodation development at the University of Queensland. When announcing their controversial international student cap, the federal government indicated building additional student residences would be a measure that would allow providers to enrol students in excess of their cap. We’ll bring you more on that announcement soon. Plibersek approves three coalmine expansions We have more on environment minister Tanya Plibersek’s approval of three coalmine expansions on Tuesday from Graham Readfearn here. In a step described by conservationists as reckless and “the opposite of climate action”, at least two of the mines, Narrabri and Mount Pleasant, will target thermal coal for export and burning in power stations. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) said the three projects, all in New South Wales, would generate more than 1.3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in their lifetime.

The president of the guild, Trent Twomey, appeared on ABC News Breakfast this morning and said pharmacists were now providing short courses of antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs, vaccinations and prescriptions for hormonal contraception. There’s a range of everyday common health conditions that are unnecessarily blocking up our emergency departments and contributing to those wait times to see our precious general practitioners. We would love to see more GPs. Who doesn’t love their local family doctor? My wife and I and our children certainly do. But we all know how difficult it is to not only find one, find one that bulk-bills, but find one that hasn’t closed their books and can take an appointment. That’s not just in the bush, that’s in our major capital cities as well, whether it’s after 6pm or on a weekend, when your local pharmacy is open. Good morning and many thanks to Martin Farrer for kicking things off for us. I’m Caitlin Cassidy and I’ll be with you on the blog today. As always, you can reach out at caitlin.cassidy@theguardian.com or via socials. In March, a 22-year-old man was charged with murder in relation to the disappearance of Samantha Murphy, who vanished on 4 February. Police said they undertook a “targeted search” in the Ballarat area on Tuesday as part of the investigation, with the search to resume this morning. Murphy’s family have also been advised of the search. Detectives from the missing persons squad as well as a range of specialist resources from across Victoria police, New South Wales police and the Australian federal police were involved in the search. Since February, police have regularly undertaken a range of enquiries and small-scale searches as part of the current investigation. We are not in a position to supply further specific details of today’s operational activity at this time. Police ask that members of the public do not attend the search at this time. Google plans to expand AI use in search The next question you ask Google could return with a detailed answer penned by artificial intelligence. The tech giant revealed plans to expand its Google Search AI Overviews product to Australia on Tuesday, testing whether the summaries it creates will encourage users to click on more links. Google’s AI Overviews, which have been tested in the US since May, use the company’s generative AI tool Gemini to summarise search results for users. The AI tool is commonly used to respond to open-ended or complex search queries, where it can summarise steps, research or suggestions on other websites, Google product search senior director Hema Budaraju told Australian Associated Press. This could include tips on how to clean a couch, for example, or steps to solve a maths problem. A very small percentage of users will see the AI overviews by default in their search results on a subset of queries where we believe these overviews make the results even more helpful. The tool famously suffered errors in early testing when AI-generated summaries told users to add glue to cheese to make it stick on pizza and to eat one small rock a day. The dangerous advice was based on an old Reddit comment and a satirical news article, respectively. University of the Sunshine Coast computer science lecturer Dr Erica Mealy said the mistakes highlighted the challenge of using a large language model to explain issues rather than to correct or suggest words. – AAP ‘The opposite of climate action’? Yesterday the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved three coalmine expansions in a step described by conservationists as reckless and “the opposite of climate action”. When Anthony Albanese’s government came to power in 2022 it declared that, after decades of disaster and neglect, the environment was going to be a top priority. But more than two years later, and with a federal election looming, has anything changed? Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor, Adam Morton, speaks with Matilda Boseley in today’s Full Story podcast about whether Labor has walked its talk on the environment. Energy future under debate The Australian Energy Market Operator has declared the national grid would remain reliable as it shifted from running on mostly coal to mostly renewables, but it would require planned investments in new generation to be delivered “on time and in full”. Bowen said the Coalition’s proposal to limit investment in large-scale renewables and eventually build nuclear plants would ensure this did not happen. [Opposition leader] Peter Dutton wants to stop renewable investment, tear up contracts for new renewable and transmission projects, and deliver expensive nuclear reactors in two decades’ time. Dutton gave a speech on nuclear energy on Monday, but did not release new information about what the Coalition planned. He promised those details – including the expected cost for households and businesses and how the Coalition planned to prevent blackouts as ageing coal plants reached the end of their scheduled lives – before the next election. Data shows renewables ‘on track’ – Bowen The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the data showed the national grid supplying the five eastern states was expected to run on 42% renewable energy this year. He said it showed its plan was “on track and building momentum”. Dylan McConnell, an energy systems researcher at the University of New South Wales, said the data showed the transition to a cleaner power grid was progressing. “There is this narrative that has developed that the transition has stalled and that’s demonstrably not true,” he said. It is happening, it just needs to speed up. Renewable energy investment and construction across Australia has rebounded beyond what had been forecast this year after slumping in 2023, but will need to accelerate further to reach the pace needed to meet the Albanese government’s goal for 2030. Australia is expected to add more than 7 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity to the nation’s grid this year, up from 5.3GW last year, according to data released by the Clean Energy Regulator. The new capacity is split roughly equally between large-scale solar and wind farms and small rooftop solar systems, mostly on homes. The regulator said final investment decisions were made on 1.8GW of new large-scale developments in the first half of the year. This surpassed the 1.6GW in total commitments in 2023, when investment decisions crashed to the lowest level in years, in part due to a longstanding legislated federal renewable energy target reaching its capacity and uncertainty over when coal-fired power plants would close. The Albanese government chose not to expand the legislated target, but has promised to underwrite 25GW of new large-scale solar and wind as it aims to have 82% of Australia’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Good morning and welcome to the rolling news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with some of the headlines from overnight before my colleague Caitlin takes over. A boost in renewable technology investment has been spruiked by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, as evidence that wind and solar power in Australia trumps a plan for nuclear energy. The Clean Energy Regulator said yesterday that it was expecting an average of more than 40% of the energy grid to come from renewable energy in 2024. Victoria police are launching another search this morning as part of their investigation into the alleged murder of Samantha Murphy, who went missing in Ballarat in February. Over the past three decades, Australia’s immigration system has come up with at least 25 different visa types to help people forced from their homes by humanitarian emergency, according to refugee advocates. This huge variation lays bare the complexities of the issue but also the iniquities.

                    "headline": "Elon Musk to present Atlantic Council global citizen award to Giorgia Meloni",
                    "bodyText": "Elon Musk is to present Giorgia Meloni with the Atlantic Council’s global citizen award in New York, as Italy’s far-right prime minister resurrects links with allies of Donald Trump before the US presidential elections. Meloni will receive the prize during a gala dinner on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in recognition of her “groundbreaking role as Italy’s first female prime minister, her strong support of the European Union and the transatlantic alliance, and her 2024 chairmanship of the Group of Seven”. Some staff at the Atlantic Council told Politico’s NatSec Daily that they objected to Meloni receiving the award, given her previous admiration for Vladimir Putin and her positions on LGBTQ+ issues and immigration. Anger mounted when the non-partisan thinktank then announced that Musk, with whom Meloni has nurtured close relations since coming to power in October 2022, would present the award. A source familiar with the situation said Meloni had learned she would receive the accolade about a year ago, and that the council’s tradition was for the recipient to select who presents it. Meloni was asked to choose between the former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Musk. “She chose Musk, not because of Trump or for any political reason, but for his vision and because she considers him a friend and a prominent person,” the source said. “The scenario has altered over the last month or so but it was too late to change it.” The council’s CEO, Frederick Kempe, brushed off concerns that the pairing could sully the thinktank’s work. He said in a statement to NatSec Daily: “Our staff includes individuals with a range of viewpoints, and it’s not unusual for lively discussions and disagreements on various aspects of how we approach international affairs. This diversity of thought strengthens our work.” Trump recently said he would appoint Musk to lead “a government efficiency commission” if he wins the election. Before taking power, Meloni was an explicit supporter of Trump, praising his brand of politics as a model for Italy and regularly travelling to his political gatherings. But she has also been savvy in building good relations with Joe Biden, bolstering Italy’s Atlanticist credentials and staunchly supporting Ukraine. Meloni first met Musk in Rome in June last year and then invited him to attend her Atreju political festival in December, where he backed her crackdown on illegal immigration and urged Italian women to “make more babies”. Raffaele Marchetti, a professor in international relations at Luiss University in Rome, said: “For Meloni, there are multiple benefits to this relationship. But first and foremost, he could potentially be an easy and solid entrance into the Trump government. She has made some contacts in the past, but Musk would mean a clear, wide-open door to Trump.” Andrea Stroppa, a Rome-based employee of SpaceX who is described as a conduit between the pair, told La Repubblica that Musk appreciated Meloni because, like Trump, “she defends western values”. Stefano Quintarelli, a tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and former Italian MP, said Meloni would maintain good relations with the US administration regardless of whether Trump or Kamala Harris enters White House. “Meloni is very good at finding ways to please one or the other,” he said. Meloni also met the bosses of Open AI, Google and Motorola in New York on Monday. “Firstly, she wants to understand more about the impact of AI and disruptive technologies and how to mitigate the negative impacts on the society without affecting the free market, and how to attract more investments in Italy,” said Paolo Messa, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Musk is a big personality and there’s a good feeling between the two of them, and so I think she is attracted more by his ingenuity rather than his political will.”"

                    "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Uncertainty before Labour’s first budget next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting companies in the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a “wait-and-see approach” to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest Labour’s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found the budget was “by far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms”. Export orders remained “relatively subdued” and total overseas sales rose only “marginally” in September. The survey said: “Some service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.” A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 – during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. More here: In other news… The economic picture in Germany is weakening too, with the economy being dragged into a contraction by its shrinking manufacturing sector. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s REA Group has added another £200m to a sweetened offer for Rightmove, valuing the UK’s biggest online property portal at more than £6bn. REA lifted its offer after its first two approaches were rejected by Rightmove earlier this month. JCB has reported an increase in profits last year as strong US sales made up for its exports to Russia ending and faltering demand in the UK and Germany. Britain’s biggest building society, Nationwide, is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a “gamechanging” move that ramps up the mortgage price war. The price of petrol and diesel in the UK is falling at the fastest pace this year, with households paying about £4 less to fill up a family car than they did a month ago. Fifty pubs a month closed for good across England and Wales in the first half of this year, with experts warning that tax rises in 2025 could make it even harder for some businesses to keep their doors open. Research has shown that house prices were not hit by the construction of a 137-mile electricity superhighway in Scotland. Back at the Labour party conference, a union boss has said Amazon should be at risk of losing taxpayer-funded contracts if it fails to “treat workers with respect”. GMB general secretary Gary Smith accused the online giant of using “despicable” tactics to stop workers at its Coventry site of unionising and questioned how it could be right for the company to receive more than £1 billion in public contracts in the last year. In July, the GMB announced that Amazon workers in Coventry had voted by 49.5% in favour of union recognition – falling just short of the required majority. Smith said the ambition for the new Labour Government has to be “higher than just cleaning up the Tory mess”, adding its “huge procurement powers will be critical”. “GMB members have been fighting to get union recognition at Amazon in Coventry. US business activity growth remained robust in September, the latest flash survey of purchasing managers shows, but election anxiety led to a drop in hiring. Dat provider S&amp;P Global has just reported that the US services sector drove a “sustained robust economic upturn in September,” more than making up for a decline in manufacturing. The flash US PMI Composite Output Index has slipped to 54.4, down from August’s 54.6, but still a level that shows robust growth. However, business optimism waned as bosses watched to see whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris would win the race to the White House in November. The survey says: A moderation of order book growth and a deterioration in business expectations for the year ahead to a near two-year low meanwhile reflected heightened uncertainty ahead of the Presidential Election. Companies consequently held back on hiring and allowed employment to fall for a second successive month. The prices charged by US companies rose at the fastest rate for six months, pushed higher by input cost growth accelerating to a one-year high, the survey added. Tensions are rising in Europe’s banking sector today, after Italy’s Unicredit took steps to more than double its stake in Germany’s Commerzbank to over 20%. UniCredit defied Germany’s defence of Commerzbank by using derivative contracts on Monday to raise its potential stake in the German bank close to 21%, while waiting for regulatory approval to lift its stake above 9.9%. Earlier this month Unicredit surprised Commerzbank by revealing it had a 9% stake – half of which was acquired from the German government. This has sparked speculation that Europe could see a cross-border banking merger. Today, the Italian bank explained: “UniCredit believes that there is substantial value that can be unlocked within Commerzbank, either stand-alone or within UniCredit, for the benefit of Germany and the bank’s wider stakeholders. However, as was the case for UniCredit, such potential requires action for it to be crystalized.” Unicredit’s move has ruffled feathers in Germany. Today, Commerzbank board member Stefan Wittmann condemned the stake-building as a “completely inappropriate aggressive act”. But in Rome, Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani declared today “it was more than legitimate” for an Italian company to try to buy part of a German competitor. Tajani said: “This is the internal market, being pro-European only in words leaves something to be desired, UniCredit is a big Italian bank and it is doing well to act within the internal market.” One hundred and 50 UK MPs have written to supermarket chain Asda, urging it to end pay discrimination across its business. The MPs say it is unfair that mainly female shop workers’ roles are paid up to £3.74 per hour less than predominantly male warehouse workers. This issue is currently being examained by a employment tribunal, which began earlier this month. Asda is fighting the case, arguing that retail and distribution are two different industry sectors that have their own distinct skill sets and pay structures.” The letter says: We, the undersigned MPs, call on you to take action against pay discrimination in ASDA stores. GMB union have told us that they have estimated women workers on the shop floor earn up to £3.74 per hour less than their male counterparts in warehouses. ASDA’s retail workers are currently owed over £2 billion in back pay. Over 60,000 current and former ASDA retail workers have lodged claims and with the equal value hearing underway, now is the time for ASDA to begin seriously considering how to address the issue of pay discrimination. We believe it is simply unfair for people to be paid differently for doing work of the same value. Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. As MPs with ASDA stores and workers in our constituencies, we urge you to urgently commence settlement negotiations with the GMB union. Signaturies to the letter include senior Labour MPs such as Diane Abbott, Stella Creasy and Rebecca Long Bailey. It comes as Asda struggles with a falling market share, and rising debts, with veteran retailer Sir Stuart Rose stepping up to run the business. In June, more than 3,500 workers and former employees of Next have won a similar six-year equal pay claim. An employment tribunal ruled that Next failed to demonstrate that paying sales consultants (mostly women) – lower hourly pay rates than warehouse operatives (who tend to be men) was not sex discrimination. Goldman Sachs Group are predicting that the pound will continue to rally against the US dollar, and hit $1.40 within a year, Bloomberg reports. That would be a notable increase on its current level of $1.33, and the pound’s highest level against the US dollar since summer 2021. The call is based on the Bank of England’s reluctance to accelerate the pace of interest-rate cuts, even though central bankers in the US and eurozone are acting more aggressively to support their economies. Summer 2021 Post Office chief executive Nick Read wanted the two post office operators appointed to the company’s board removed, and blocked them from meetings on issues including pay and bonuses, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. Saf Ismail was appointed to the Post Office board as a non-executive director in June 2021, along with fellow subpostmaster Elliott Jacobs, in a move to repair relations and improve oversight as part of an attempt to overhaul the organisation and “right the wrongs of the past”. Ismail gave scathing testimony to the inquiry saying that while the other non-executive directors on the board welcomed the new appointments, Post Office executive members did not. “The wider executive made it difficult [and there were] situations we didn’t feel welcomed by the wider executive,” he said, adding: “I was told by an individual on the wider executive that ‘we don’t want to particularly deal with you and Mr Jacobs as we feel uncomfortable with what has bee happening’”. Ismail said that Jane Davies, the former Post Office HR director that accused Read of bullying and an “obsession” with remuneration, told him that he [Read] wanted them off the board. He said: “She categorically told said to me how the chief executive was not happy with postmasters being on the board. We were too awkward, too challenging, and he wanted that to be reversed. There were times when I spoke to the previous [Post Office] chair [Henry Staunton] and Jane Davies and they particularly mentioned how the wider executive ensured myself and Mr Jacobs were blocked out of meetings that involved talking about bonuses and salaries. We were actively excluded from their meetings.” An investigation by an independent barrister cleared Read on all counts of misconduct relating to Davies’s accusations against him. Ismail said that despite the promises to overhaul the culture and processes at the Post Office it remains too bureaucratic, and is focused on protecting its own employees instead of exiting those involved in the wrongful prosecution of subpostmasters from the organisation. “I heard Paula Vennells say [to the inquiry] that she started to try cultural change in 2012,” he said. “I don’t feel we’ve even got off the ground.” He said that until recently the two subpostmaster board members were not provided documents relating to various committee meetings, and recounted an example of the hiring for a role internally where the Post Office executive ignored the recommendation of a candidate by the board, instead appointing their own choice. Ismail criticised two initiatives launched to root out staff involved in the Horizon IT scandal, Project Phoenix and Past Roles, saying that decision-making was “inquiry-led” with the semblance of action only being taken after events at the Post Office inquiry put a spotlight on individuals. Ismail said that while subpostmasters were immediately suspended and then pursued legally, Post Office staff involved remain employed, and are often redeployed with a new job title, instead. He said there are 23 employees on a “red” list, deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom who have even been suspended. “To be clear from my observations at the time there was no particular appetite to deal with this issue,” he said, adding: “Decisions were ‘inquiry-led’. The default position in the Post Office at this moment in time is protect. Unfortunately this business redeploys, recycles. I don’t feel it is appropriate for individuals in the red category to be in the business. I feel it is an insult. This is not a witch hunt, this is parity.” Britain’s biggest building society is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a “game-changing” move that ramps up the mortgage price war. Weeks after it was announced that the Halifax and Lloyds would allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income, Nationwide said it would now go up to six times income – a first for a major high street lender. Nationwide is also cutting its mortgage rates and increasing its maximum loan sizes, so that someone taking out a home loan for more than 90% of the property’s value will now be able to borrow up to £750,000 – up from the existing £500,000, and higher than the £570,000 limit at many rivals. The moves come amid an ongoing mortgage price war that has seen lenders jostle to cut their rates in the wake of the Bank of England’s 1 August interest rate cut and the expectation of more reductions to come. Disinflation and interest rate cuts will stimulate UK growth in the rest of this year, credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings has forecast. In its latest report, S&amp;P predicts that consumers will spend more as price rises slow, while businesses will benefit from lower borrowing costs, encouraging investment. Looking ahead, S&amp;P predict: Supply shocks following the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine are no longer fueling inflation. The opposite is now true, with shortages, energy, and food prices representing a drag on inflation compared to before the start of the pandemic. We expect this will be the case for much of the rest of the year. They add: The period of real wage catch-up as price inflation led to higher wages, and companies raising prices and increasing profit margins in response to higher input costs, is over. The model no longer underestimates wage and price dynamics as it did from second-quarter 2022 and throughout 2023. Profit margins are narrowing and companies have had to grapple with higher financing costs and weak demand growth. Consequently, they are less willing to increase their workforce or employee salaries. Newsflash: Swedish electric car battery maker Northvolt plans to lay off 1,600 employees in Sweden, including 1,000 positions at its factory in Skelleftea in the north of the country. Northvolt, which had been Europe’s great hope for a electric battery manufacturer, says it is “adjusting its near-term ambitions” and focusing on deeloping its lithium-ion battery gigafactory at Ett, near the Arctic Circle. This, Northvolt says, will allow it to prioritize commitments to its current automotive customers. Northvolt is cutting 1,000 positions at Skellefteå, 400 at Västerås, and 200 in Stockholm. Peter Carlsson, CEO and co-founder of Northvolt, says: “While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate. We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business. Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we’re taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt’s future.” Post office owner-operators from a minority ethnic background are more likely to have been threatened with suspension than those from a white background, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. An anonymous survey published on the first day of the final phase of the long-running inquiry also received reports from eight subpostmasters who said that they had been suspended or threatened with suspension in the last three years after issues with discrepancies with the IT system had emerged. The survey, conducted by research firm YouGov, found that 8% of a total of more than 1,000 respondents said that they had been threatened with suspension by the Post Office in the past. However, it found that 12% of subpostmasters threatened with suspension were from an ethnic minority background, and 17% of those with an Asian/Asian British background. A further 4% said that they had been suspended and subsequently re-instated. “Subpostmasters surveyed from ethnic minority back grounds were more likely than white subpostmasters to have been suspended and re-instated - 6% versus 2%,” said the YouGov report. “As were those who have been serving subpostmasters for 21 years or more.” Gavin Ellison, the head of public sector and not-for-profit at YouGov, told the hearing that the findings were statistically significant. Last year, documents released to campaigners revealed that lawyers investigating post office operators in the Horizon computer scandal used a racist term to categorise Black workers. Investigators were asked to group suspects based on racial features, a freedom of information request found. The document, which was published between 2008 and 2011, included the term “negroid types”, along with “Chinese/Japanese types” and “dark skinned European types”. Ellison was asked whether there was a link between suspensions and subpostmasters finding discrepancies in their accounts using the Horizon IT system. However, while he said that while there was “no causation between those two factors” the survey did find respondents who said that this was the case. YouGov published an addendum document relating to the issue which contained some anonymous written statements about the issue in the past three years. One respondent said: “There were shortfalls when we first took over the post office. We had complained but we were told that the computer doesn’t make mistakes. An audit [was] done a few months later and we were accused of theft and threatened to be suspended if we didn’t pay back the money. We [were] already told their system had flaws.. but they still accused us. Degrading us. Calling us thieves. Majority post office auditors made postmasters feel like thieves.” YouGov qualified the experiences of these subpostmasters, pointing out that 69% of the overall respondents to its survey had reported having experienced discrepancies with the Horizon IT system since January 2020. “A total of eight SPMs surveyed reported being suspended or threatened with suspension in the past 3 years and all stated that they experienced an unexplained discrepancy since 2020,” the research company said in the three-page document. “We can only identify correlation not causation.” The YouGov report showed that the 89% of the discrepancies reported by respondents was less than £1,000, although 1% reported a discrepancy of £30,000 or more. Shares in UK semiconductor group Alphawave have dropped by a quarter this morning, after the company cut its guidance for full-year revenue and earnings this morning. Alphawave make customised silicon chips and also silicon ‘building blocks’ that are integrated into chip designs. It reported a 51% drop in revenues, year-on-year, in the first half 0f 2024, resulting in a pre-tax loss of almost £50m, down from a £6m loss a year earlier. Alphawave lowered its guidance due to “a merger of two large AI customers in Korea”, which led to development programmes being consolidated. Tony Pialis, president and chief executive officer of Alphawave Semi says the company plans to help drive the next generation of artificial intelligence systems: “We are successfully executing on our strategy, with a significantly expanded range of advanced connectivity solutions, including chiplets, that will enable the next generation of AI and cloud infrastructure. In the first half of the year, we have continued investing organically to support our pipeline and future revenue growth. Our leading connectivity technology and strong execution give us confidence in the prospects for our business in the second half of 2024 and beyond.” Newsflash: UK factories have been hit by a slump in export orders this month. The CBI reports that export order books are now their weakest since December 2020 – during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. Its latest industrial trands report has found that total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of 44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below “normal” this month. That’s a considerable deterioration compared to August, where the reading was -22%. Worryingly, output volumes fell sharply in the three months to September – and manufacturers expect output to decline again in the three months to December. This is the first time since November 2023 that expectations have been negative. Ben Jones, CBI lead economist, said: “This was a uniformly disappointing set of results for the manufacturing sector, with output falling over the past quarter, order books deteriorating and manufacturers expecting activity to soften further in the remaining months of the year.” “The survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the Budget at the end of next month.” “In the meantime, firms will be looking to the Chancellor to reaffirm the government’s mission of long-term economic growth, providing them with the confidence and opportunities to invest and grow.” The UK PMI report is the latest sign that uncertainty around October Budget is a concern for businesses, says Daniel Mahoney, UK economist at Handelsbanken: Mahoney also points to last Friday’s data showing consumer confidence in the UK has fallen sharply. He says today: While the [PMI] release is showing a broadly positive picture for the UK’s economic prospects, concerns about the upcoming Budget feature prominently in the survey. We saw last Friday that consumer confidence has taken a knock due to worries about upcoming tax measures and businesses appear to be concerned on this front, too. In both the manufacturing and service sectors there were some reports of clients adopting a “wait and see” approach to decision making ahead of the Autumn Budget. Moreover, the most cited concern among UK private sector firms was fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the October Budget. We continue to hope that the hit to consumer and, to a lesser extent, business confidence is short-lived given the fundamentals of the UK economy do not warrant this kind of pessimism. The news that Rachel Reeves is ordering investigations into more than £600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the Conservatives has been welcomed by anti-corruption campaigners. The Guardian reported this morning that the chancellor will announce today that she will refer more than half of contracts for material such as masks to the incoming Covid corruption commissioner. Daniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International UK says this is an “important first step” towards accountability over governent spending during the pandemic. Bruce hopes that some of the money spent on pandemic equipment can be recovered, saying: “We have repeatedly warned of the scale of corruption risk in the former government’s approach to procurement during the pandemic and have identified over £15 billion of high-risk contracts in need of investigation. Today’s announcement is an important first step towards full accountability for the serious procurement failings we saw during the pandemic and we urge the Chancellor to launch similar investigations into the 135 contracts we’ve identified. Such investigations offer an important chance for the new government to recoup some of the millions of pounds of public money wasted on these contracts and implement lessons learned to ensure this never happens again. This month’s slowdown in company prices rises, according to the PMI report, may make it easier for the Bank of England to lower interest rates soon. S&amp;P’s Chris Williamson explains: In the meantime, services inflation, stubbornly elevated rates of which have been the bugbear of the Bank of England, cooled in September to the lowest since February 2021 to help bring the Bank of England’s 2% inflation target closer into view. The survey data therefore support the view that there is scope for interest rates to fall further in the closing months of 2024.” Capital Economics predict the Bank will cut rates once more this year in November, before the pace of cuts quickens next year with rates eventually settling at 3.00%. This morning’s “ugly” eurozone PMI numbers contrast again with a more resilient UK economy, says Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at broker Ballinger Group. The UK maintained its growth advantage versus the eurozone in September, according to the PMIs. While the eurozone economy slipped into contraction for the first time since February at 48.9, the British surveys signalled cooler but steady growth at 52.9. The eurozone numbers are not pretty, and they are providing some validation to those at the ECB calling for a quicker pace of rate cuts to ease the deceleration in activity. The economic rebound we saw in the first half of the year has completely fizzled out, and the return to contraction attests to the fact that ECB policy is probably more restrictive than necessary. Pricing for an October rate cut is ticking higher, and without a stabilisation in the growth outlook, there will be convergence to the more dovish rate path for the Fed - especially given growing signs of layoffs in the manufacturing sector. That’s not a good picture for the euro. Meanwhile, the UK economy remains relatively resilient, and the gap has widened even further versus the eurozone. Everything about the report says soft landing for the UK – growth is cooling but remains robust, and inflationary pressures are evidently easing. There are plenty of softer price indicators in the report for the Bank of England to take comfort from, with employment growth slowing and growth in end prices falling to a more than three-year low. The pound has hit a two-year high against the euro, after this morning’s PMI surveys showed the UK economy outperforming the eurozone this month. Sterling has gained half a eurocent to €1.1967 this morning, its highest level since early August 2022. Although UK company growth is slowing this month, the economy doesn’t seem to be sliding into a downturn, reports Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Kerr says that September’s PMI report is consistent with GDP growth slowing from 0.6% q/q in the second quarter of this year to a more normal rate of around 0.3% q/q in the third quarter. Kerr told clients: The fall in September’s composite flash PMI is not a sign that the economy is on the cusp of another downturn, but instead is further evidence that real GDP growth has slowed towards a more normal rate in Q3 after the burst of growth in the first half of the year. Uncertainty ahead of next month’s budget is weighing on the UK economy, the latest survey of purchasing managers across British companies shows. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that UK private sector activity growth has slowed this month, across both services firms and manufacturers. Some companies reported that clients are taking a “wait-and-see approach” to decision-making ahead of the Autumn Budget, which is hitting investment. Fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the budget, due on 30 October, was “by far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms”, the PMI survey shows. Private sector employment growth slowed for the second month running to its weakest since June. But encouragingly, firms slowed their price rises this month – with the average prices charged by private sector firms rising at the slowest rate since February 2021. Overall, the Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index dipped to 52.9, down from August’s 53.8. That’s a two-month low, but still in growth territory, and much cheerier than in Germany or the wider eurozone this month (see earlier posts). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: “The September PMI data bring encouraging news, with robust economic growth being accompanied by a cooling of inflationary pressures. The data therefore hint at a ‘soft landing’ for the UK economy, whereby the fight against inflation is showing increasing signs of being won without higher interest rates having caused a downturn. Williamson adds, though, that concerns about the budget are “jangling nerves somewhat”, explaining: Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government’s policies, especially towards taxation. Hiring likewise has been stifled by business uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook ahead of the ‘budget’. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged this morning that there will not “be a return to austerity”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, Reeves said: “There won’t be a return to austerity, there will be real terms increases to government spending in this Parliament. “What I’m saying is there will not be real terms cuts to government spending, but the detailed department by department spending will be negotiated.” The downturn in Germany has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction this month. Business activity across the euroarea has decreased so far in September, according to the HCOB Flash Eurozone PMI index. It has dropped to 48.9 this month, an eight month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. As well as Germany’s slump, the eurozone was also pulled down by a contraction in France’s private sector, as an Olympics-related boost to business activity in August faded. Business confidence continued to wane, as firms reported a drop in new orders. The recovery in the UK housing market, and the prospect of more cuts to UK interest rates, makes Rightmove an attractive target for Australia’s REA Group, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown: Streeter explains: Rightmove shares had been affected by the property market downturn amid a ratcheting up in interest rates. But now, with more cuts eyed on the horizon and a recovery in prices underway, there are now many more eyes on screen. REA Group is clearly highly tempted by the sturdy fundamentals of the model, which offers an envious operating margin position of around 70%. DIY alternatives may be growing, but they are only a small slice of the market, and many estate agents can’t afford not to advertise on Rightmove. That’s demonstrated by their willingness to pay bigger sums to attract potential buyers. Although total membership has reduced by 1% in the last full year, average revenue per advertiser was up 9% to £1,431. Newsflash: the German economy is sinking deeper into contraction, dragged down by its manufacturing sector. Thw latest HCOB ‘flash’ PMI survey compiled by S&amp;P Global, just released, shows that business activity across Germany is falling at the quickest rate for seven months in September. German businesses reported increased caution among customers, deterring them from making investments; concerns towards the health of the economy were reported to be a factor. Total inflows of new business fell at the quickest rate for nearly a year in September, and firms cut jobs for the fourth month running. This pulled Germany’s flash composite PMI output index down for the fourth month in a row, to 47.2, down from August’s 48.4. That’s the lowest reading since February – anything below 50 shows a contraction. Manufacturing shrank at the fastest pace in a year, while the modest growth in the services sector was the weakest in six months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, fears that a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth in a row) in Germany is now “baked in”. De la Rubia says: “The downturn in the manufacturing sector has deepened again, evaporating any hope for an early recovery. Output plunged at the fastest rate in a year, with new orders collapsing. In a sign of resignation, companies have shed staff at a rate not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This comes as several major automotive suppliers have announced significant job reductions. These troubling figures are likely to intensify the ongoing debate in Germany about the risk of deindustrialization and what the government should do about it. Optimism is something of the past. Manufacturers are downright depressed about their future activity, with expectations for the coming year plummeting. In a striking shift, moderate optimism in August has quickly turned into the steepest pessimism in a year by September. This rapid downturn in sentiment is most likely linked to the wave of negative headlines surrounding Volkswagen, which has cast a shadow over the broader industry. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany’s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June. Newsflash: Rightmove has said it will “carefully consider” the new, inproved, takeover offer from REA Group, and respond “in due course”. In a statement to the City, Rightmove confirms it has received a third proposal from REA, which it dubs “unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional”. Rightmove says its. board will “carefully consider the Increased Proposal, together with its financial advisers.” Rightmove shareholders should take no action in respect of the Increased Proposal, it says. Andrew Fisher, chair of Rightmove, reiterates that REA’s first two bids were both rejected for being “uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive”. Fisher says: “Rightmove is an exceptional company with a very clear strategy, a consistent track record of delivery and a strong management team. The Board is confident in the Company’s short and long term prospects, and sees a long runway for continued shareholder value creation. “Based on the implied value and structure of REA’s first and second indicative non-binding proposals, we considered these proposals to be uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected them. “The Board will continue to act on behalf of our shareholders and respond to the most recent proposal in due course.” Rightmove also points out that the 2% drop in REA’s shares today has pulled down the value of its cash and share offer, from 770p to 761p [making the offer worth around £6bn]. Rightmove has jumped to the top of the risers on the FTSE 100 share index at the start of trading, after Rea Group upped its takeover offer again. Rightmove are up 3.8% at 700p. That’s still some way shy of Rea’s new offer, which values Rightmove at 770p per share. There’s drama in the government bond markets this morning, where Sri Lanka’s debt is sliding after left-wing candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the country’s presidential election. Dissanayake, seen as marxist-leaning, has capitalised on the anger and frustration that had emerged following Sri Lanka’s economic crisis. Having won the vote, he has pledged to preserve democracy and clean up public life, promising that a “new renaissance will rise from this shared strength and vision”. But Sri Lanka’s bonds have been hit, on fears that the nation’s bailout by the International Monetary Fund and debt deals could be threatened. Bonds fell around three percentage points, with a security that matures in 2025 losing 3.3 cents to 49.28 cents. Spending on health and beauty products is booming despite cost-of-living pressures, a new survey shows. The latest Barclays Consumer Spend data shows health and beauty has been the highest-performing category in retail since August 2023. Last month, consumer spending on health and beauty rose 7.3% year-on-year, while overall retail spending was up 0.1%. Nearly half of consumers see such spending as “essential” – a category which typically includes priority purchases such as groceries and childcare, Barclays says. Karen Johnson, head of retail at Barclays, says: “It’s encouraging to see that overall beauty spending has been in growth year-on-year, with August showing the highest level of growth in the past 18 months. Our data shows that social media has proven to play a key role in influencing online purchases, a further demonstration of the rising commercial importance of these platforms. “The health and beauty sector exemplifies continuous growth, likely driven by social media, particularly among younger generations. The key to a resilient retail model is examining these trends to better understand future purchasing behaviours.” Elsewhere this morning, smart sensing software company Oxford Metrics has told the City that customers are being more cautious. Oxford Metrics told shareholders that it now expects adjusted pre-tax profts to be materially below current market expectations for the financial year. It explained: While the Group continues to have a healthy pipeline, the trend of more extended buying cycles has developed in the second half against a strong prior year comparative. Globally, we are seeing customers across our markets exercising greater caution and purchasing decisions are taking longer to conclude. A number of opportunities in the pipeline have now shifted into the new financial year. Shares in REA Group have dropped by 2.1% today on the Australian stock market, after it upped its offer for Rightmove again. Having lifted their takeover offer again, Rea also disputes Rightmove’s claim that its approach is “wholly opportunistic”. They told investors today: Rightmove’s share price has lacked any sustained upward momentum for two years, with a last 24 months VWAP [volume-weighted average price]] of 540 pence, a last 12 months VWAP of 540 pence and an undisturbed share price on 30 August 2024 of 556 pence, despite being supported by its ongoing share buyback programme and revised strategy announced at last year’s Capital Markets Day. This chart shows Rightmove’s shares jumped at the start of this month, when REA’s original approach was announced: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. When bidding for property, it’s important not to take no for an answer. Australia’s REA Group is taking this advice seriously, and has just launched its third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove. After being rebuffed twice this month, REA has upped its offer again. It is now proposing to pay around £6.1bn for the UK’s biggest online property portal. REA’s offer is worth 770p per Rightmove share – structured as 341p in cash and 0.0422 new REA shares In a statement to the Australia stock market this morning, Owen Wilson, CEO of REA, insisted the deal made sense, saying: “We believe that the combination of our world-leading expertise and technology with the attractive Rightmove business will create an enhanced experience for agents, buyers and sellers of property. We live in a world of intensifying competition and this proposed transaction would bring together two highly complementary digital property businesses for investment and growth. Wilson added that REA is “genuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove’s Board”. REA, which is majority owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, made its first approach to Rightmove on 5 September, when it proposed paying 705p per share, or £5.6bn. That was rebuffed, with Rightmove’s board saying it “fundamentally” undervalued the company. Then on Friday night, news broke that REA had increased its offer by £300m. Rightmove weren’t commenting officially on that offer yesterday, but Bloomberg reported that “people familiar with the matter’” said it had been rejected. Now, Rightmove’s board must ponder this third offer. The company’s shares closed at 674p on Friday night (before news of the second offer broke), which values Rightmove at £5.32bn.

                    "headline": "Cooking up recipe data for the Feast app",
                    "bodyText": "You may have heard the Guardian has a new cooking app called Feast. With thousands of searchable recipes, cook mode, and lots of other lovely features, it’s been well received on both iOS and Android. You should definitely get it. No article on its own could possibly do justice to the work that’s gone into making Feast a reality (a big book might be able to pull it off) but this is a look at a vital piece of the app – its data. There’s no recipe app without recipe data. At least, not one with any functionality worth writing home about. Over the course of Feast’s development we went from zero structured recipes to more than 4,000 and counting. Assembling it was a truly cross-department, collaborative effort, and so far it seems to have come out pretty well. This is how we did it. Chicken and egg What does ‘structured recipes’ actually mean? The Guardian has published recipes for centuries. (Fun fact: the first edition in 1821 promoted a vegetarian cookbook.) These recipes have titles, images, steps. Aren’t they structured? As content, yes. As data, no. When we talk about structured data, we’re talking about breaking it down a bit like this: The above is overly simplistic – structured data often has to be more granular – but that’s the gist: recipes in a consistent format of fields and values. For years recipe data at the Guardian was stuck in a catch-22. Structured data for recipes didn’t exist, so the benefits of having it weren’t felt, meaning structuring recipes wasn’t prioritised, so structured data for recipes didn’t exist. Feast broke that cycle. To power the app we needed to structure thousands of existing recipes, and update internal tooling to make it realistic (or better yet, easy) for food journalists and editors to sign off on structured versions of new ones. The recipe for a good model To have recipe data you need a recipe data model – a consistent shape that captures the nuances of thousands of dishes. This is easier said than done. The data’s form would impact multiple departments for years to come, from editorial to tooling to design. Settling on a recipe data model had to be a collaborative effort. Nothing else would have worked. Journalists, editors, tooling engineers, data scientists, designers, product researchers … all these groups and more had their say, multiple times. It is a rare occasion where you really do want lots of cooks in the kitchen. Refining the model was an iterative process. When everyone involved was more or less happy, there was then the small matter of actually creating the data. Through the Hatch Structuring recipe data can’t be fully automated. AI is clever, but it has well documented limitations and is worryingly prone to hallucinations. At the same time, asking people to fill in dozens of form boxes for every recipe would have bordered on inhumane. We needed a solution that combined automation with expert journalistic oversight and curation. This was the approach we settled on: Structure old recipes with a machine-learning model trained in-house by the thoroughly brilliant data science team. Drop the resulting data into a temporary recipe curation tool inside which food journalists could use their expertise to refine and approve recipes. Put the curated data in a database. In parallel the same functionality could be added to the Guardian’s bespoke content management system, Composer. When it was ready to assume recipe curation responsibilities, we could switch over. In the proud tradition of cutesy names for internal tools, we named our temporary tool Hatch. (Like a kitchen hatch through which food is passed. The recipes are the food, and the hatch … anyway.) With help from the Source design system it looked somewhat professional fairly quickly, and even integrated with other Guardian services like Grid and Pinboard. With Feast’s deputy editor Anna Berrill taking the lead on food curation, we were able to hit 1,000 curated recipes by the time Composer was ready to succeed Hatch. Feedback from Anna allowed Chloe Kirton and other members of the Content Production team to massively refine the curation process. Hatch was duly closed and recipe structured data was fully absorbed into the existing tooling. As anyone who has worked with large tech estates will tell you, there is a unique satisfaction to decommissioning a tool. As I write there are 4,300 structured Guardian recipes, with more added each day. Piping hot The end result of this process is a rich and growing recipes dataset that can be used in all sorts of useful and lovely ways. Feast was obviously the catalyst and for now the main benefactor, but a cooking app is just one form the data can take. Having a structured archive has allowed the Guardian to join the likes of BBC Good Food and NYT Cooking in having recipe schema for recipes published on the web, which has already led to an uptick in organic search traffic to the site. Feast’s development in many ways showcased the best of the Guardian. For such an extensive recipe structured data archive to come together as quickly and (relatively) painlessly as it did is a testament to the collaborative nature of the project, and to the hard work of dozens of people across multiple departments. From war reporting to food journalism, the high-water marks come when editorial, engineering, product, and design work together. When it comes off the results really are quite delicious."

Australia overtook Russia in the Asia influence rankings. The Greens say they won’t pass Labor’s Reserve Bank reforms until interest rates are cut. Katy Gallagher says the government remains committed to the reforms. The latest polls show equal waiting for Albanese and Dutton in the eyes of voters. There’s been a call for thousands of blood donors as demand soars. The ACCC has announced it is taking Coles and Woolworths to court over alleged misleading claims Peter Dutton said he would abolish the position of the First Nations ambassador. The government has released the exposure draft on a mandatory food and grocery code. The government announced it will provide an additional $10m in aid in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Peter Dutton delivered a keynote address on nuclear energy at the Ceda conference in Sydney about the Coalition’s nuclear energy policy, saying information on actual implementation and costs would be released “in good time”. The Independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, said Dutton had put forward “no credible plan for cutting carbon emissions and delivering reliable energy over the next decade”. The Albanese government has appointed a new Energy Infrastructure Commissioner to facilitate the renewables rollout. Victoria is still talking to the federal government about rail loop funding, the state’s premier, Jacinta Allan, said. A man has been charged with murder after a 39-year-old woman from Palm Island died from head injuries. And AFL stars walked the Brownlow medal red carpet. The live news blog will be back bright and early tomorrow morning. High Court dismisses appeal to return Australian IS families Just one more news update before we leave you for tonight. The high court has refused a bid to repatriate Australian children and mothers of Islamic State fighters detained in refugee camps in Syria, AAP reports. The decision on Monday is another blow to the legal challenge brought by Save the Children Australia against the government to compel it to return the mothers and children. The federal court ruled in June the government did not have control over their detainment, with the advocacy group seeking special leave to appeal in the high court. One more picture from the Brownlows – and thank you for joining us on the blog for this jaunt down the red carpet – we’ve seen Josh Daicos of the Collingwood Magpies arrive with fiance Annalise Dalins. Bec Judd is returning to the Brownlows for the first time since 2018 and has chosen a pale pink number from J’Aton Couture for the occasion. Meanwhile a satellite event is also taking place at Sydney Cricket Ground called the Sydney Swans Brownlow Medal Function, where Chad Warner and partner, Alice Hughes, have arrived. Oglia-Loro couture is proving a favourite this evening with Charlotte Viney, wife of Melbourne’s Jack Viney, arriving in a couture gown from the Melbourne designer who was also the choice of Annalise Dalins. Brownlow medal contender Marcus Bontempelli arrives with partner Neila Brenning in an Effie Kats dress. It’s classy and glassy on the Brownlow red carpet Cinderella wore a glass slipper to the ball but Dee Salmin has updated the fairytale with a stained glass corset. The host of Triple J’s the Hook Up podcast and partner of Collingwood captain Darcy Moore unveiled her outfit this evening on social media, describing how she spent months working with glass artist Poppy Templeton to create a stained glass corset: 2003 Brownlow medal winner Nathan Buckley arrives with partner Brodie Ryan. The man tipped to win the big prize this evening is Collingwood star Josh Daicos, newly engaged to Annalise Dalins, who will hit the carpet draped in pearl-encrusted custom gown by Oglia-Loro couture. Adam Treloar of the Western Bulldogs arrives with partner Kim Ravaillion in a corseted fishtail silhouette. Attendees at this year’s Brownlow Medal award ceremony have started treading the red carpet and we will be keeping you up to date with all the fashion. Unsurprisingly, we are already seeing some sparkles as the AFL stars pull out their finest for the sport’s night of nights. The favourite for the award is Collingwood’s Nick Daicos, but also in contention are Essendon captain Zach Merrett, Bulldogs’ Marcus Bontempelli, Carlton’s Patrick Cripps and Brisbane Lions’ Lachie Neale. Neale is the reining winner from last year, with Bontempelli runner up. Here we have presenters Dale Thomas and Abbey Holmes making their entrance: Too much pasta? Pesto the penguin expected to lose some pounds as he fledges If you’re in need of a more lighthearted end to a long Monday, you should definitely read this story about Pesto the chunky emperor penguin chick on your commute home: Young golf star Jeffrey Guan in specialist care after freak injury Young golfer Jeffrey Guan is in the hands of an eye surgeon in Sydney after being hit in the face by a golf ball, with the injury threatening his promising professional career, AAP reports. The 20-year-old has already undergone one round of surgery in Canberra, where he was airlifted after being struck by an errant shot during a pro-am event on the NSW far south coast. Guan, from Sydney, then travelled from Canberra to seek specialist care at the Sydney Eye hospital. Golf Australia (GA) issued a statement saying the young gun had been hit just below his eye in the pro-am, played before a NSW Open regional qualifier tournament. Guan was taken to hospital by paramedics, before being transferred by air to Canberra. At the family’s request GA wasn’t releasing any further details of the prognosis or treatment. The injury occurred just a week after Guan made his US PGA debut in California. A man has been charged with murder after a 39-year-old woman from Palm Island died from head injuries. Queensland Police say the domestic violence offence comes after emergency services were called on 1 September after reports the woman had sustained a life-threatening head injury. She was airlifted to Townsville university hospital for treatment, but died from her injuries on 3 September. Police say after extensive investigations, officers arrested and charged a 36-year-old Palm Island man on 16 September, who they alleged was known to the woman. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear next before Townsville magistrates court on 5 November. Winning streak snapped as Aussie shares slip from record levels The Australian share market has retreated from the record highs set last week, snapping its seven-day winning streak before Tuesday’s Reserve Bank meeting, AAP reports. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Monday finished down 56.6 points, or 0.69%, to 8,152.9, while the broader All Ordinaries dipped 53 points, or 0.63%, to 8,384.2. The Australian dollar was buying 68.22 US cents, from 68.20 US cents at Friday’s ASX close. Greens: third Bass Strait diesel spill evidence regulator failing to take strong action Up to 21,000 litres of diesel that has spilled into the ocean from an Esso/ExxonMobil fossil fuel facility in the Bass Strait is another example of why the offshore energy regulator is not taking strong enough action, Greens spokesperson for healthy oceans, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson says. The regulator Nopsema has warned of potentially significant threats to the surrounding marine environment from this recent spill, but the Greens say too little is being done as this is the third spill from an Esso/ExxonMobil facility in just six months. Whish-Wilson is concerned Esso is now applying to use old gas fields for dumping carbon pollution despite evidently not being able to manage its operational offshore infrastructure. Esso/ExxonMobil is proving to be a highly problematic and dangerous operator – yet Australia’s embattled offshore oil and gas industry regulator, Nopsema, is failing to take the strong actions necessary to rein in the fossil fuel giant. Nopsema is supposed to have oversight and regulate the environmental management of the offshore fossil fuel industry, but coastal communities are fast losing confidence in the ‘independent’ regulator, which has become more of an enabler than an investigator of offshore oil and gas projects. Esso’s inability to manage its operational infrastructure safely is deeply troubling given the company’s currently applying to use old gas fields for dumping carbon pollution. Fossil fuel corporations make millions from Australia’s offshore oil and gas fields yet repeatedly breach our environmental management laws and have also gotten away with not properly cleaning up after themselves. Australia desperately needs stronger laws and regulations to govern the offshore fossil fuel industry. How much more must our oceans and marine wildlife suffer before the Albanese government acts to change this? Sydney protesters reject Dutton’s ‘toxic nuclear scheme’ As we mentioned earlier in the blog, community members rallied outside Peter Dutton’s address at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) in Sydney on Monday. The protest was organised by GetUp and allies to reject Dutton’s push for nuclear power in Australia. This is what chief campaigns officer at GetUp and Goreng Goreng woman Amy Gordon had to say: Peter Dutton and the hard right are trying to divide and distract our communities by pushing their toxic nuclear scheme. But today community members turned out in force to say ‘no’ to radioactive nuclear. For decades, First Nations communities have led the fight to protect water, land and community health from uranium mining and nuclear waste dumps. But Dutton continues to keep communities in the dark about the risks and costs of his seven proposed nuclear plants. Pushing slow-to-build nuclear allows polluting coal and gas to burn for decades longer, exacerbating the climate impacts we’re already seeing with extreme floods, fires and heat. The only people who benefit from Dutton’s radioactive scheme are mining billionaires like Gina Rinehart. Together, we’re building a movement to take on the Coalition’s dangerous anti-renewables and pro-nuclear disinformation – and stop Peter Dutton becoming prime minister. Lawyers for Indigenous NT police officers will go to federal court if mediation fails The human rights complaint lodged against the Northern Territory government and its police commissioner on behalf of serving Aboriginal police officers, follows Commissioner Michael Murphy’s public apology in August to Indigenous Territorians for past harms and injustices caused by members of the NT Police. Lawyer Dana Levitt says this apology was offensive to Aboriginal community police officers because it implied they had been complicit in the system. It was a blanket apology about racist conduct by the NT Police. It didn’t distinguish between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal members of the force ... the way it was worded caught them up in the apology themselves, and they don’t have anything to apologise for. The lawyers say they plan to pursue the matter in the federal court if mediation is unsuccessful. - AAP Racism complaint is a ‘positive step’, NT police commissioner says Three serving Aboriginal police officers have lodged a complaint against the Northern Territory government and police commissioner, alleging racial discrimination over a 20-year period, AAP reports. The complaint, lodged with the Australian Human Rights Commission, alleges racial vilification and derision, and an unequal system of pay and promotion. Sydney-based law firm Levitt Robinson lodged the complaint on the officers’ behalf. Lawyer Dana Levitt says: (Aboriginal Community Police Officers) have been subject to racist conduct since their position was invented. A lot of them have complained about the treatment to which they were subject or they’ve seen other community members subject and nothing has been done about it. Levitt says these are not historical complaints – “they are still very much of today”. In a statement, Commissioner Michael Murphy says it would be inappropriate to comment on the specifics of the case, instead saying the police force is “invested in cultural reform”. What I can say is that it is a positive step for NT Police that members have the confidence to speak up about issues such as racism. So far, the first stage of the Suburban Rail Loop project is expected to cost $34.5bn and has been funded to the tune of $14bn. The state government is contributing $11.8bn and the federal government has committed $2.2bn. Premier Jacinta Allan says discussions are continuing with the commonwealth about funding and Victoria cannot afford not to build extra transport connections. She says the project “absolutely stacks up” after winning support at two state and one federal election: Melbourne is the biggest city in the country … and it deserves to get its fair share of infrastructure funding from its national government. They’re the conversations I’ve been having and will continue to have with the federal government. Opposition spokeswoman Jess Wilson claims the money for the project “doesn’t currently exist”. The premier is focused on talking about a suburban rail loop that nobody seems to want, it’s unfunded. We are constantly seeing from this government talks of the federal government stepping in and providing significant amount of money for this project. - AAP Melbourne adopts Sydney Metro’s tunnel boring machines The first stage of the Melbourne Suburban Rail Loop will be built using tunnel boring machines that carved out the new Sydney Metro, AAP reports. From 2026, the machines will start creating a 16km stretch of tunnels running from Cheltenham to Glen Waverley, due to open in 2035. Two of the four machines Victoria ordered from German company Herrenknecht were used to build the Sydney Metro. There is renewed focus over the project’s cost, after a Parliamentary Budget Office assessment earlier this month found the first two stages of the orbital train line around Melbourne will not provide adequate value for money. The two main sections, dubbed SRL East and SRL North, will form a 60km metro line that will run through the city’s middle suburbs and across 13 stations. The independent analysis requested by the state opposition found construction costs would be about $96bn, with every $1 spent returning social benefits of between 60 and 70 cents. Good afternoon everyone! Plenty of news coming your way, including more nuclear reaction and the Brownlow Medal red carpet fashion later this evening. Many thanks for joining me on today’s blog. I’ll hand over to Natasha May who will guide you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. NFF president praises Tony Mahar’s ‘passion, professionalism and approachability’ Continuing from our last post, National Farmers Federation president David Jochinke has recognised Tony Mahar’s decade of service to the organisation and the agriculture sector, as he leaves to become the new Energy Infrastructure Commissioner. Jochinke says: During his tenure, Tony has strengthened NFF’s position as the leading national advocacy body for agriculture through his integrity, stakeholder management skills, and dedication to the industry. His passion, professionalism and approachability earned him respect across industry, government, and corporate partners, and we have greatly appreciated his leadership … It is a challenge to lead a national peak body, in this case bringing together all elements of our primary industries, and engaging effectively with supply chains both upstream and downstream, and I commend Tony’s professionalism, credibility, and determination in doing so. The Albanese government has appointed a new Energy Infrastructure Commissioner to facilitate the renewables rollout. Tony Mahar, the outgoing chief executive of the National Farmers Federation, has been appointed to the role – to act as an intermediary between farming and regional communities, and industry and government. A statement from climate minister Chris Bowen says Mahar’s work will include investigating the optimal delivery of long-term social and economic benefits to host areas, and “promoting more information and transparency to combat misinformation” about major energy projects. Mahar will stand down from the NFF to take up this non-statutory appointment for an initial term of three years. Bowen says: Mr Mahar has great experience working with business, government, farmers and farming communities and has the respect of both landholders and the energy industry. Bowen thanked John Sheldon who served as the interim Commissioner, following the retirement of former Commissioner Andrew Dyer. The Independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, says Peter Dutton has “put forward no credible plan for cutting carbon emissions and delivering reliable energy over the next decade”. In a statement reacting to Dutton’s Monday speech about nuclear policy, Spender echoes earlier comments she has made that nuclear power can’t deliver in a 10-year timeframe. There is no way nuclear can replace the 90% of coal-fired power due to exit in the next decade. We can’t let a debate on nuclear extend our reliance on fossil fuels and distract from the critical decarbonisation work of the next 10 years … The Liberal party needs to commit to delivering a 43% reduction [in carbon] by 2030, in line with Australia’s international commitments. Currently, Peter Dutton won’t even commit to having a 2030 target. That’s not a credible climate policy. Spender says Australians “can’t afford to wait until the late 2030s and 2040s and hope for a silver bullet” when it comes to addressing climate pollution. Business needs policy certainty. It’s time to back our world-leading wind and solar resources – backed by storage and gas peaking – rather than creating uncertainty and scaring off investment. Greens, Nats represent ‘populism going mad’, John Hewson says Former leader of the Liberal party, John Hewson, has weighed in on the current state of Australian politics, writing on X: Populism going mad – Greens want [the government] to set interest rates. The Nats want tax-free beer. Hang commonsense, history and the national interest. Rain heading from central Australia to the east, this week The Bureau of Meteorology has published a national weather forecast, looking at a rain band forecast over central and northern Australia, which is expected to push east in the coming days. Electric cars crash through Aussie price barrier – again Electric vehicles have crashed through another price barrier in Australia, AAP reports, with the cost of one new model reduced to less than $31,000 for the first time. MG has gains lowered the price of electric vehicles in Australia, cutting the price of its entry-level MG4 hatchback to $30,990 until the end of October. That’s $8,000 less than its recommend price in August and comes despite strong sales for the vehicle in Australia. The MG4 is now Australia’s cheapest electric car, followed by the MG SZ EV ($34,990) that had a price cut in August, and the GWM Ora hatchback that had held the title after a price cut in April ($35,990). MG Motor Australia’s chief commercial officer, Giles Belcher, says the lower price is designed to encourage motorists to make the move. We know that people may have been considering an EV but potentially have held off due to the cost. [This] ensures all buyers who had been thinking of making the switch to an EV now can thanks to the lower entry point. Dutton sidesteps issue of nuclear power’s social license ‘problem’ Taking a final question, an audience member asks: Why does the Coalition believe that nuclear is going to have less of a social license problem than renewables? Peter Dutton responds by talking about the debate itself: I think this debate has progressed incredibly successfully in a short period of time. The government tried to run the safety issue to start with; I think [Peter] Malinauskas and others slapped them down. And we come now to a cost discussion, which is a very worthy discussion. But the international experience is going to mean that we can deliver it more cheaply here, and we can learn in a way that’s going to underpin our economy. The Coalition has not yet released the cost involved with its nuclear policy, as we mentioned earlier. Dutton says this will be released “in due course”. For more context on the question of cost, you can have a read of this piece from Graham Readfearn: Dutton: Labor’s power policy driven by fear of losing ground to the Greens Peter Dutton argued that the government is “more concerned about the domestic impact” of policy and “whether it’s going to drive people from the Labor party to the Greens.” And the threat in Anthony Albanese’s seat is not from us. The Liberal Party won’t win Grayndler. He’s dead worried about the Greens because the Greens hold the local council divisions, they hold the state government seat, and they’re worried desperately about losing seats like that to the Greens, and unfortunately, our national interest is running second. Dutton: In wake of Aukus deal, why not have a domestic nuclear industry? Asked why previous Coalition governments didn’t pursue nuclear energy, Peter Dutton argues that it wasn’t possible before the Aukus deal. We sought bipartisan support from the Labor Party. We were never – obviously – going to get it from the Greens, but we sought it from the Labor party because that was part of our negotiation with the US. And I don’t think the US would have signed up to Aukus without their being a bipartisan position. And therefore, if under Aukus, you’re saying that nuclear technology is safe for submariners to sleep alongside and for those submarines, as I said before, to come into Australian ports, to be within a stone’s throw of residential housing and populations of Australians … If you have signed up under Aukus to dispose of waste at end-of-life, you have made a decision that it is safe to do so. And therefore, why not a domestic nuclear industry? Holding up Ontario as model for power policy more than a little ‘bizarre’ Just back to that Ontario example that was raised: our own Graham Readfearn has examined Peter Dutton’s claims of cheap power prices there. Prof Mark Winfield, a sustainable energy expert at Ontario’s York University, says he finds “the notion of holding Ontario up as a model for electricity and climate policy more than a little bizarre”. For the full details, you can have read below: Dutton called on to prove nuclear power cheaper than renewable energy Another audience member asks Peter Dutton to provide “quantitative evidence” to back up the claim that nuclear power will deliver lower prices than renewable energy. Dutton says that when you look at international examples, “you can see the cost per kilowatt … you can see the end cost … you can see where the research and development money is going, and that’s that’s the reality of it”. Dutton claims per unit cost of nuclear ‘cheaper’ over time An audience member asks how much debt Ontario took on to develop a nuclear industry? Peter Dutton replies that when it comes to Ontario, you need to “look at the user price today”. I think when you look at it on a comparable basis, we can look not just to the United States and to Europe [but also to] Asia and elsewhere, and if 19 of the top 20 economies in the world are on this pathway, we’re the only one, then I think your questions around costs [are] dealt with. Uhlmann notes that in terms of debt, “we’re looking at something between 250 billion and half a trillion dollars”. Dutton responds: I’m not going to the figures now … but the fact is that you end up with a much cheaper per unit cost under nuclear over time … Dutton claims South Australian premier ‘fully signed up’ to nuclear Peter Dutton is now taking questions from moderator Chris Uhlmann from Sky News. He is asked about the fact nuclear energy is illegal not just at a federal level, but also at the state level, and how this might be navigated. Dutton claims the South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas is “fully signed up to nuclear” and says: The only reservation Peter Malinauskas has expressed about nuclear is in relation to cost, and I believe that we can deal with those concerns. Dutton says his nuclear plan is ‘truly visionary’ Peter Dutton is wrapping up his speech, and told the conference: We can’t switch nuclear power on tomorrow, even if the ban was lifted overnight. Like other countries, we need to ramp up our domestic gas production in the more immediate term to get power prices down and to restore stability to our grid. But what we can do is also ensure that Australia doesn’t miss the nuclear train. The opposition leader said the Coalition’s desire to see Australia become a nuclear-powered country is “in our national interest” and claimed the policy is “truly visionary, and it’s a policy unlike any put forward by a political party this century”. Peter Dutton has been detailing the Coalition’s nuclear power plan, but still hasn’t announced the cost – saying it is coming “in due course”. Our nuclear plan requires a significant upfront cost, and you can look at the international examples to see as much. But a whole new and vast transmission network and infrastructure won’t be needed under the plan that we’re putting forward … We’ll release our costings in due course, at a time of our choosing. I know Chris Bowen believes he’s running this debate, but he’s not, and we’ll provide more detail on many elements … And just as we were upfront about the locations of our nuclear sites – and as we’ve seen in the debate so far, the government hasn’t been able to dispute those seven sites that we’ve put forward – we’ll have more information about the cost of nuclear, we’ll have it in good time. It will be independently verified, and it will show a cost differential, which is significant in favour of nuclear coming into the mix. Nuclear power: Germany shut its remaining plants in April 2023 Peter Dutton has been speaking about a number of international examples of nuclear policy, and – as we just mentioned – claimed Australia is the only country in the top 20 economies not using nuclear. But that isn’t entirely true, as Adam Morton reports. Germany, the world’s third biggest economy, shut its remaining nuclear plants in April last year, and Italy, Europe’s third biggest economy, also had a nuclear industry from the 60s, but shut its plants in 1990 after a referendum. You can read the full article below: Dutton says ‘it is clear’ Albanese government will not reach 2030 emissions target Back at Peter Dutton’s speech in Sydney, he argues that “it is clear” the Albanese government won’t reach its 2030 reductions target. Indeed, there is zero chance of the Albanese government reaching net zero by 2050, using renewables alone. He also argues emissions are up since Labor has taken office, making the case for nuclear: Australia is the only country in the top 20 economies that is not using zero-emissions nuclear power, or taking steps to put it into the mix. As Dutton continues speaking, it’s worth reading this article from our environment editor, Adam Morton, looking at some of the key questions and claims being raised around nuclear: Australian shares down, consumer staples biggest loser after ACCC action against Woolies and Coles The Australian share market has dropped from record high levels, AAP reports, taking time to digest gains from its seven-day winning streak ahead of tomorrow’s Reserve Bank meeting. At midday AEST, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 65.8 points, or 0.8%, to 8,144.0, while the broader All Ordinaries was down 65.5 points, or 0.78%, to 8,371.7. The consumer staples sector was the biggest loser, dropping 2.8% after the ACCC launched legal action against Woolworths and Coles for allegedly misleading buyers about their discounts. Woolworths shares were down 3.2% to a six-week low of $33.87, while Coles had dropped 3.4% to a two-week low of $18.565. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton is speaking at the Ceda conference in Sydney about the Coalition’s nuclear energy policy. He says that energy “isn’t part of the economy, [but] is the economy”, and told the crowd the Coalition and Labor have very different approaches: The path Labor is on with renewables only, in my judgment, is a dangerous one for our country. Labor’s policy will cause even higher energy costs and an even more unstable grid than what we’re seeing today. Labor’s energy policy, along with its … IR and environment policies, are creating an economic perfect storm, which is having a very negative impact on the economy. He argued that the Coalition’s energy policy is “the only” plan for cheap and consistent energy, and that the Coalition “sees renewables and nuclear as companions, not as competitors.” So the Coalition’s policy – like many other countries, the policies that they’ve adopted – it’s for an energy mix. Renewables firmed up by gas and nuclear. Albanese on Greens: ‘They don’t talk about the environment any more’ but ‘some extreme agenda’ Anthony Albanese was asked about the prospect of working with the Greens from minority government, if that is the outcome of the election. He responded that he was confident he would form majority government after the next election, and criticised both the Greens and Coalition: What the Greens are doing is they defer votes on things. What that has done is defer the rollout of public housing, which we need … If you have an amendment to legislation, move it … Adam Bandt has changed the way that the Greens party operate. They don’t talk about the environment any more, they talk about some extreme agenda. They seek to divide and they have that in common with Peter Dutton’s Liberal party, who are always seeking division, not seeking unity or not seeking to bring Australians together. My government is focused on making a difference to the lives of Australians each and every day. Katy Gallagher says opposition to RBA reforms ‘all politics’ Finance minister Katy Gallagher, who is also speaking to the media in Canberra, said that the government is still committed to its RBA reforms. The bank supports the reforms. They’re important reforms to strengthen the independence of the RBA and to ensure that it is essentially set up for the job it needs to do in the future, so we remain committed to them. This comes as the Greens said they wouldn’t back the reforms unless the government intervened to make the RBA cut rates. Gallagher continued: I mean, this is all politics, right, and you know, I can’t think for a reason why the federal opposition would not support strengthening the independence of the RBA, were it not for politics, and the Greens are just crazy. Albanese says divestiture powers ‘not the solution’ On the exposure draft, Anthony Albanese was asked if he would be open to divestiture powers, as the Coalition has proposed? He said, “it doesn’t change my mind on it”. It is rather extraordinary that you have a Coalition, a Liberal party, in 2024, along with the Greens political party, that have the same policies of breaking up capitalism. If Coles sells their shop, who is going to move in to the local supermarket chain? Chances are they’d be divesting towards each other. That’s not the solution. What the solution is is making sure that you have an ACCC with pumped up powers. Albanese said that this is “not rational policy” from the opposition, and they “are putting forward thought bubbles” – turning to nuclear energy ahead of Peter Dutton’s speech this afternoon: And we’ve seen Peter Dutton give a speech today on nuclear energy where months after he said he would come clean with how much it would cost with all of the detail, we had none of it. I have no idea why he’s giving this speech. I assume that they locked it in the diary in advance and said we’re going to give a speech about nuclear energy … and we’ll put out the costings and do all of that, and had a look at it and said, whoops, it doesn’t add up. Albanese says if products cost more than they should ‘of course it has an inflationary impact’ Taking questions, the prime minister was asked about the ACCC’s alleged misleading conduct by the supermarkets – which dates back to the December quarter of 2022 when inflation peaked at 7.8%. Does he think the supermarkets’ alleged actions contributed to inflation, and subsequently contributed to the Reserve Bank’s actions? Anthony Albanese responded: “When you’re charging more for products than you should it of course has an inflationary impact, by definition.” And we know that inflation is what the Reserve Bank is concentrating on in terms of monetary policy, as they should, to try to get it down to the band of 2% to 3%. Albanese on ACCC action against supermarkets: ‘If this is found to be true, it’s completely unacceptable. This is not the Australian spirit’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been speaking to reporters in Canberra. He announced the launch of the exposure draft on the new mandatory food and grocery code – as Josh Butler reported earlier. The PM also commented on the ACCC’s court action against Woolworths and Coles, and said: These are serious allegations that the ACCC is bringing before the courts. If this is found to be true, it’s completely unacceptable. This is not the Australian spirit. Customers don’t deserve to be treated as fools by the supermarkets. They deserve much, much better than that. My government takes today’s announcement by the ACCC very seriously. As it’s before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment further, but we will examine as the courts are able to deliberate. Shoppers are on the hunt for discounts when they do their weekly grocery shop, because every dollar matters when people get to the checkout. Advertised discounts need to be genuine – each and every time. Specials need to be real, because household budgets are tight. And I welcome the ACCC standing with supermarket shoppers. Protestors gather outside Ceda conference ahead of Peter Dutton’s nuclear speech The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is due to give a speech on the Coalition’s nuclear energy policy at the Ceda conference at 1pm. Some protesters have begun gathering outside the conference in Sydney, ahead of his speech: Call for for Victorian FOI laws to be rebuilt ‘from the ground up’ Victoria’s Freedom of Information laws are struggling to meet the needs of a modern democracy and must be entirely rebuilt from the ground up, according to a parliamentary review. As AAP reports, the report released today has revealed Victorians are forced to wait up to a year to access their own medical records or other personal information from what’s been described as an “impenetrable” 40-year old system. The report stated: Victoria’s first-generation FOI legislation cannot be repaired, or even renovated ... the legislation needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. Many government agencies take a “defensive approach” and purposely release as little information as possible, Integrity and Oversight committee chair Tim Read said. More than two-thirds of the 48,000 requests for information each year relate to individuals wanting information about themselves. Dr Read said delays, complexity, high fees, public records in a poor state and an unhelpful culture contributed to the current system’s reputation for being impenetrable. The parliamentary committee made 101 recommendations including replacing existing legislation with an entirely new “Right to Information” law, widening the scope from “documents” to all information in the digital age and a presumption that requested details will be released. It also called to abolish fees related to requests for personal information and limiting other charges. Choice says price of food and groceries consistently ranked as number one concern Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer group Choice, has been speaking with ABC TV about the court action ACCC is taking against Coles and Woolworths. Thomas said that late last year, Choice wrote to ACCC with examples of discount claims it “didn’t think stacked up”. This action today is a really excellent example of the power of the consumer voice … We know that consumers are really doing it tough, and the cost of food and groceries is really at the top of the list. Consistently for a number of years now, food and grocery prices have ranked at the top of Choice’s quarterly surveys about what consumers are most concerned about. That figure has been almost 90% of consumers are worried about this, so it’s definitely something where people are feeling the pinch. Doctors warn of the health risks of nuclear power ahead of Dutton speech As the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, plans to deliver a major speech with further details on how Australia could use nuclear energy, medical group Doctors for the Environment Australia say it rejects nuclear power because of the its high health risks. Dutton will deliver the keynote address around lunchtime today at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) conference, laying out how the Coalition’s proposal to build seven nuclear reactors across five states would work. The Doctors for the Environment statement warns: Uranium – the most widely used fuel by nuclear power plants – is a heavy metal with the potential to harm our health, including kidney failure, diminished bone growth and damaged DNA, the genetic blueprint of life. The high-level radioactive waste it creates cannot be safely disposed of and there is no known secure long-term storage. Every stage of mining, transport, processing, using and attempting to dispose of radioactive fuel has the significant potential to contaminate the environment and endanger workers and those living nearby. Potential health and environmental risks arise from uranium mining and processing because it contaminates the environment with radioactive dust, radon gas, water-borne toxins, and increased levels of background radiation. Nuclear power plants themselves produce radioactive emissions in air and water, in addition to other nuclear waste. Workers in the nuclear industry show higher rates of cancer. Nuclear cannot decarbonise the energy sector fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change, and distracts from and delays more reliable, safer and cheaper renewable technologies. Nuclear power plants are vulnerable to extreme weather – cyclones and storms, floods, droughts and fires, as well as sea level rise. Nuclear power outages have occurred due to these factors already and are likely to increase. There is an extensive history and ongoing risk of nuclear accidents and incidents, including at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Nuclear power requires large amounts of water. Reduced water supplies will be felt hard by our regional and remote communities. The industry emerges from the history of nuclear weapons testing and uranium mining on First Nations lands without consent, and may continue to disproportionately affect First Nations people. Meta says more teens under 18 in Australia on Instagram than Facebook The proportion of teens under 18 on Facebook is significantly lower than the number of teens on Instagram, according to new data from Meta. The company, which announced an overhaul to the accounts of teenagers under 18 on Instagram last week, revealed in response to a question from a Senate inquiry last week that based on self-reported ages of users on the two platforms in Australia, 10% of Instagram users are under 18, while for Facebook it is just 5%. Meta said it was currently working to comply with a notice from the eSafety commissioner to break down the figure to the ages of those under 18, which will probably feed into the public debate over what limit the age ban should be. The Coalition favours 16, while the federal government has indicated the minimum age will probably be somewhere between 14 and 16. Meta also pushed back at the use of the term “scraping” for it using public posts from Facebook and Instagram in training its AI. It argues scraping refers to third-party accessing of data from the internet, which Meta’s is not because it is on its own platform. While Meta has admitted to using public posts in its AI training, the company said it goes out of its way from other companies scraping the data. Meta said: We devote substantial resources to combating unauthorised scraping on Facebook products. We have a dedicated Anti-Scraping Team, including data scientists, analysts, and engineers focused on our efforts to detect, block, and deter scraping. Hazard-reduction burn in Sydney’s Beacon Hill The NSW Rural Fire Service says it is conducting a 1-hectare hazard reduction burn in Sydney’s northern beaches, around Beacon Hill. The burn is located 1km from the Meatworks Avenue fire, which is burning at advice level. McKim says RBA board are ‘not high priests who are beyond criticisim’ The Greens have hit back at Labor government criticism over their stance on the Reserve Bank reforms, with senator Nick McKim saying the RBA board are “not high priests who are beyond criticism”. Labor’s latest stoush with the Greens goes to reforms at the RBA, with the government seeking to establish a new board to deal with monetary policy. The Coalition has refused to back the change, leaving Labor to deal with the Greens – who have said they won’t support the reforms until interest rates go down, either by the RBA’s normal decisions, or by Jim Chalmers using arcane legislative provisions to force them to lower the rates. It’s led to another round of Labor v Greens bickering. McKim, the Greens treasury spokesperson, said they weren’t backing down on their criticisms. McKim tweeted this morning: We are unashamedly using our political power to fight for mortgage holders who are getting smashed by high interest rates. Housing affordability has never been worse in Australia, and the RBA governor has admitted some Australians will have to sell their homes. We need action. Time for Jim Chalmers to end his ritual ashen-faced handwringing, end the pretence there’s nothing he can do, and intervene to bring down interest rates. McKim pointed out soaring rent and mortgage rates, and backed in the Greens’ tactic of “deliberately bringing the RBA into the centre of the political debate where it belongs”. The RBA board are unelected technocrats, not high priests who are beyond criticism. Every decision they make is political. The Greens will keep fighting until interest rates come down. DHL downplays delivery impact as 1200 workers strike As we brought you earlier via AAP, about 1,200 DHL workers have planned a four-hour work stoppage at warehouses in NSW and Victoria today. As AAP reports now, DHL has said it has taken measures to minimise the impact of the strike on customers. A spokesman said in a statement: This is supported with the assistance of over 3000 DHL team members nationally who continue to service our customers. The United Workers Union has been trying to negotiate new workplace agreements since March, including a 21% pay rise over three years for NSW workers, and a 10% rise each year for three years for Victorian workers. The company said it had offered workers a wage increase in the form of an upfront, one-off payment. The spokesperson said: We regret that the UWU has been determined to lead the taking of protected industrial action against DHL, despite the fact that a large part of the workforce have accepted and received our offer. However, we are confident that DHL employees will be able to vote up these agreements and receive wage increases as soon as possible. The Australian federal police have charged a Melbourne man for allegedly interfering with aviation radio networks to “broadcast various chants and false mayday recordings”. The man, 45, is expected to appear in Melbourne magistrates court today and face three charges for the alleged radio interference at Melbourne airport over a two-month period. An investigation commenced this month, with investigators executing a search warrant on Saturday at the man’s Lower Plenty residence. Officers allegedly located and seized four handheld radios and associated equipment, allegedly used to transmit the interference – including two mobile phones with recordings of chants and mayday messages. The man was arrested and charged with three offences, including one count of radio transmission capable of prejudicing the safe operation of an aircraft. The government has announced it will provide an additional $10m in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In a statement, the government said funding would be directed to Unicef and UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund) to provide “lifesaving assistance, with a focus on women and girls, including the delivery of nutrition support, as well as hygiene and dignity kits.” Since 7 October, Australia has committed $82.5m in humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said: Australia’s support will help address the dire humanitarian situation with the delivery of nutrition and essential hygiene and health products. Rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief must reach civilians, and aid workers must be protected to enable their lifesaving work. We continue to press for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians and the release of hostages. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said the situation in Gaza is “catastrophic” and that “civilians should not be made to pay the price for the horrendous acts of others”. The ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, was asked about the interim report on supermarkets handed to Treasury, and where this investigation sits in relation to that. She responded: These considerations and these allegations actually were brought to us before the commencement of the supermarket inquiry and the supermarket inquiry is excluding and not considering those specific elements. Asked just how big this is, Gina Cass-Gottlieb said it was “very significant”. The conduct we are considering is very serious. It is part of one of our most important priorities to protect consumers this year, which has related to the pricing of essential products and services, and you can’t get more essential than food and grocery products. Asked if one supermarket was more egregious than the other, she replied: We do consider it is significant behaviour for each of them and don’t think that actually it does justice to either to make a comparison. Cass-Gottlieb was also asked if the people in charge should stand down, and responded: “That decision is a decision for the supermarkets and the board of the supermarkets.” Gina Cass-Gottlieb was also asked about the potential of a class action from consumers, and said there is “always a potential of class actions” when consumers “have been harmed”. We are seeking, through the community service order, in order to give to the community and the most needy members of our community, redress. The ACCC is seeking community service orders that Woolworths and Coles each fund a registered charity to deliver meals to Australians in need. She detailed this order further, and said: We will put to the court that there should be a substantial additional donation to charities that are providing food relief and meals in aid to needy families and that each of Coles and Woolworths are ordered to pay additional donations to support that. Gina Cass-Gottlieb detailed the material harm to consumers from the alleged actions: When the discounts are not genuine, consumers are foregoing buying products at another store which is offering genuine discounts or buying a different product that has a genuine discount. Q: Does the fact that consumers picked this up suggest that they aren’t even trying to hide it? Are you concerned about how brazen the supermarkets are being? Gina Cass-Gottlieb: We have both exercised our enforcement and investigation powers here, following on the tipoffs … from consumers. We are also looking in depth at the supermarket sector, pursuant to a government direction in order to look at competition, costs, prices and margins. We are testing this behaviour in multiple ways. Gina Cass-Gottlieb was asked if she was “stunned” these alleged actions happened? She responded: What we can see is that consumers do come to understand and to consider, after seeing very lengthy periods of sustained price reductions, and a very short significant price increase … Consumers come to understand these aren’t genuine price reductions. She pointed to the example of the Oreo Family Pack product, which we detailed earlier. Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the ACCC is seeking “a significant penalty” from Woolworths and Coles, but there is no dollar figure at this point. This is serious conduct. It is of great concern to us and it affected many consumers with millions of products sold, [allegedly] subject to this practice. That penalty has to be high enough to be not a cost of doing business for such major companies to deter them from this conduct in the future and deter all retailers from this manner of conduct. ACCC chair addresses media about court action against Woolworths and Coles Chair of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, is speaking to the media following news it would take court action against Woolworths and Coles over its “prices dropped” and “down down” promotions, which it alleges were misleading. She told reporters about how the investigation began: We first identified this conduct because of contact from consumers. We then tracked social media and saw on X, reddit and TikTok that hundreds of consumers were reporting prices that they did not consider were genuine. We followed that up with our own in-depth investigation using our compulsory powers. We understand that many consumers are seeking to manage their household budgets, including through the use of discounts on their grocery purchases. In times of cost of living pressures, it is critical that all pricing claims and price discount claims are accurate. At the same time as the ACCC court action against Coles and Woolworths, the government has released its exposure draft on a new mandatory Food and Grocery Code that will apply to the big supermarkets and subject them to multimillion-dollar fines. This comes after the review of the old grocery code. The government’s plans, announced by the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, would implement the recommendations of Craig Emerson’s review in full. Leigh said in a statement: The new Code will help to ensure our supermarkets are as competitive as they can be so Australians get the best prices possible. The new conditions would see Aldi, Coles, Woolworths and Metcash “subject to multi‑million‑dollar penalties for serious breaches”. Leigh said: The Code increases protections for suppliers by introducing strengthened dispute resolution arrangements, and new obligations to protect suppliers from retribution, which will be complemented by the creation of an anonymous supplier and whistle‑blower complaints pathway through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. His announcement dropped into inboxes just after 9am – around the same time as the ACCC action about advertising of supermarket discounts was announced. Consultation on the new grocery code is open today, until 18 October. Consultation on related amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 is open until 4 October. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said he would axe the First Nations ambassador if elected. This comes after the Daily Telegraph reported the Albanese government approved spending of more than $350,000 last financial year to send the ambassador on nine overseas trips – mostly to the US and Europe. Justin Mohamed was appointed to the new role in March 2023. Speaking to 2GB radio this morning, Dutton said: If it is the case that we win the next election, that position will be abolished on day one … I think this is a waste of money … It’s the only position of its nature in the world … It will be a very different way of governing if we win the next election. DHL workers strike in NSW and Victorian warehouses Around 1,200 DHL workers have planned a four-hour work stoppage at 23 warehouses in NSW and Victoria today, AAP reports. The United Workers Union has been trying to negotiate new workplace agreements since March, including a 21% pay rise over three years for NSW workers, and 10% each year for three years for Victorian workers. The stoppage will affect big brands including Mattel, Nike, Australia Post, Samsung, and the union said it had contacted DHL to ensure life-saving medicine deliveries would not be affected. UWU national secretary Tim Kennedy said in a statement: This is a cost-of-living strike. Workers at DHL sites are earning below industry standards, working very hard to make ends meet. The union has also complained about a proposal to pay new employees less, with DHL workers writing in a statement: How can they justify lower new starter rates when cost of living is going up? It can cause friction between people who do the same role for different pay rates, that isn’t fair. AAP has contacted DHL for comment. The ACCC provided an example of the alleged conduct by Woolworths, focusing on the Oreo Family Pack product. It said in a statement: From at least 1 January 2021 until 27 November 2022, Woolworths offered the Oreo Family Pack Original 370g product for sale at a regular price of $3.50 on a pre-existing ‘Prices Dropped’ promotion for at least 696 days. On 28 November 2022, the price was increased to $5.00 for a period of 22 days. On 20 December 2022, the product was placed on a ‘Prices Dropped’ promotion with the tickets showing a ‘Prices Dropped’ price of $4.50 and a ‘was’ price of $5.00. The ‘Prices Dropped’ price of $4.50 was in fact 29 per cent higher than the product’s previous regular price of $3.50. In this example, the ACCC alleges Woolworths had planned the temporary price spike to establish a new higher ‘was’ price for the subsequent ‘promotion’. Woolworths had decided (after a request from the supplier for a price increase) on or around 18 November 2022 to take the product off ‘Prices Dropped’, increase the price, and then put the product back on to ‘Prices Dropped’ three weeks later. More on the ACCC court action against Woolworths and Coles Continuing from our last post: the ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, alleged that Woolworths and Coles breached Australian consumer law by “making misleading claims about discounts, when the discounts were, in fact, illusory”. The ACCC alleges the conduct involved 266 products for Woolworths across 20 months, and 245 products for Coles at different times across 15 months. Cass-Gottlieb said: Many consumers rely on discounts to help their grocery budgets stretch further, particularly during this time of cost of living pressures. It is critical that Australian consumers are able to rely on the accuracy of pricing and discount claims. The ACCC estimates Woolworths and Coles sold tens of millions of the affected products and “derived significant revenue from those sales”, it said. The ACCC is seeking declarations, penalties, costs and other orders. It is also seeking community service orders that Woolworths and Coles each fund a registered charity to deliver meals to Australians in need. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is taking Woolworths and Coles to court, over allegedly making misleading “prices dropped” and “down down” claims. The allegations relate to products sold by Woolworths and Coles at regular long-term prices which remained the same, excluding short-term specials, for at least six months and in many cases for at least a year, the ACCC said. The products were then subject to price rises of at least 15% for brief periods, before being placed in Woolworths “prices dropped” and Coles’ “down down” promotions at prices lower than during the price spike but higher than, or the same as, the regular price that applied before the spike, the ACCC said. Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said: Following many years of marketing campaigns by Woolworths and Coles, Australian consumers have come to understand that the ‘Prices Dropped’ and ‘Down Down’ promotions relate to a sustained reduction in the regular prices of supermarket products. However, in the case of these products, we allege the new ‘Prices Dropped’ and ‘Down Down’ promotional prices were actually higher than, or the same as, the previous regular price. Moving to housing, Nick McKim was asked what it would take for the Greens to back some of Labor’s proposals – including help to buy. He said the Greens want to see action on negative gearing and on the capital gains tax discount: We have $176bn planned to be handed out to property speculators over the next decade. And what that means is that renters who want to get into the market to buy their first home are bidding against property speculators with all of these massive tax breaks … some who own seven or 70 or in some cases many hundreds of investment properties have this unfair advantage. We want to see something done to level the playing field so renters can get in the housing market, and we also want to see a reform that isn’t going to do more – as Labor’s reforms will – to put up housing prices in a market which is already seeing housing unaffordability at the worst rate in the country’s history. McKim says Greens ‘make no apology’ for ‘dragging RBA into political debate’ Given that the treasurer Jim Chalmers has already said he is unlikely to intervene in the RBA, Nick McKim was asked what else the Greens would need to see to support the reforms? Or would they be “happy to see it die”? He responded: If Jim Chalmers wants this bill passed, as he said he does, and if the governor of the Reserve Bank, Michele Bullock, wants to see this bill passed, as she has said she does, they know what they’ve got to do. We’re agnostic in terms of whether it’s Jim Chalmers using his powers to bring interest rates down, or whether the RBA actually make a decision to bring interest rates down, we just want to see some relief for mortgage holders. McKim said the Greens “make no apology” for their stance or for “dragging the RBA into the political debate, because every decision the RBA makes is political.” High interest rates are driving a mass transfer of wealth out of the pockets of mortgage holders and into the already eye-wateringly large profits of the big banking corporations in Australia. It’s time for some action. Asked if an intervention into the RBA to cut rates would “shatter” its independence, Nick McKim argued that the “Reserve Bank has never been independent.” That’s unambiguous, the power exists in Australian law for the government of day to set interest rates. We’re simply urging the government to step in, bring interest rates down, and provide some much-needed relief for mortgage holders who are getting absolutely smashed at the moment. We’ve got the governor of the Reserve Bank out recently saying that people, some people are going to have to sell their homes because of high interest rates, housing affordability has never been worse as I said, it’s time for significant action. It’s time for significant relief. We make no apologies for fighting for renters and we make no apologies for fighting for mortgage holders. Greens senator defends ultimatum on RBA reform The Greens senator Nick McKim is speaking with ABC News Breakfast, after the Greens earlier announced they wouldn’t help Labor pass its RBA reforms unless it intervenes to cut interest rates. Responding to comments from the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, that the Greens were “out of control”, McKim responded: “I can tell Labor what is out of control, and that is the housing crisis in Australia.” And if she thinks we’re damaging, I can also tell Labor what is damaging, and that is the fact that rents have gone up 30% since Labor came into power, and we’ve had a record series of 13 interest rate rises in a row. Renters and mortgage holders are getting smashed. Housing affordability, on the figures out this morning, has never been worse in Australia. And we are unambiguously using our political power in the parliament to fight to bring interest rates down [so] mortgage holders get some much needed relief. Brandis outlines concerns over US support of Ukraine in conflict if Trump is re-elected George Brandis says that the Australian government is not giving the priority to the defence of Ukraine that it ought to. The former attorney general and former high commissioner to the UK spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning and described the war in Ukraine as “a conflict of global dimensions”. Because it … potentially sets against one another all the great superpowers. Russia is enabled by China, Ukraine resistance is supported by the West, led by the United States and European nations … Were Russia to succeed, [it] will be the most important defeat for the western democracies since the second world war. Brandis said if Donald Trump is re-elected as US president, he believes one of the first things he would do is pull American military support from Ukraine. Brandis said he “very much fear[s] the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House”. People on my side of politics concerning Mr Trump have been to the effect [saying] that were Trump to be re-elected, the Australia-US relationship would continue, largely as is, and in particular, that Aukus will be safe … My concern is a broad concern, not about the bilateral Australia-US relationship, but about America’s broader commitment to the defence of the democracies … [against] authoritarian powers who are more linked up at the moment than they have been in two generations. Victorian Pride Lobby says slate of candidates trying to ban LGBTQ+ books The Victorian Pride Lobby’s Rainbow Local Government campaign says a slate of candidates running in the upcoming Whittlesea city council elections are trying to ban books with LGBTQ+ content. The group of candidates, led by Aidan McLindon, the former deputy leader of the far-right Freedom party, is pushing for books containing information on sexuality to “be withdrawn” from public libraries. Equality advocates say the group is censoring LGBTQ+ content. Sean Mulcahy, co-lead of the Rainbow Local Government campaign, said: Our libraries must remain safe spaces for diverse ideas and beliefs where everyone is seen, heard, and valued. People have the right to choose which library books they read and borrow and which library events they attend – without interference. This comes in the wake of a failed attempt by Cumberland city council in NSW to impose a similar book ban. Dutton to lay out detail on nuclear power plan in speech today Further details on how Australia could use nuclear energy are set to be revealed in a major speech by the opposition leader on the power proposal, AAP reports. Peter Dutton will give an address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia today, laying out how the Coalition’s proposal to build seven nuclear reactors across five states would work. However, it’s not expected the cost of building the reactors will be unveiled in the speech. The coalition outlined in June plans to build reactors in the Hunter Valley and Lithgow in NSW, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Callide and Tarong in Queensland, Port Augusta in South Australia and Collie in Western Australia, should it win the next election. Should the proposal go ahead, it would be 10 to 12 years before the first reactor is built, before the remainder are constructed from the 2040s. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Coalition proposal would not solve energy issues in Australia, telling Sky News yesterday: Peter Dutton’s nuclear fantasy is economic insanity. It costs more, it will push power prices up, it will take longer. He needs to come clean … in this speech: what will it cost, what will it mean for power bills, how will he pay for it, and what will Australia do for the decades it will take to build these reactors? Independent says Greens ultimatum on RBA reforms ‘extreme’ The Independent MP for Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, has responded to comments from the Greens that it won’t help Labor pass its RBA reforms unless it intervenes to cut interest rates. In a post to X, Scamps labelled the move “extreme”: Calling for the treasurer to intervene and cut interest rates is extreme. The independence of the RBA is critical to our economic system. NSW firefighters continuing to fight Sydney northern beaches fire that broke containment lines Inspector Ben Shepherd from the NSW Rural Fire Service was speaking with ABC News Breakfast earlier. A hazard reduction burn that burst containment lines in Sydney’s northern beaches over the weekend has been brought under control – with significant smoke likely in the area as the fire continues to burn. Shepherd said: Primarily the fire is contained. There’s still a small section towards Oxford Falls that firefighters will need to work on today, and hopefully then this afternoon we’ll really be on the mopping up and we’ll do that over the coming days. He said there has “no doubt been [an] incredibly wet period” over the past three years, especially for NSW, leading to increased fuel growth. This area up on Red Hill hasn’t burned since 1994 – [although] there have been areas around this actual burn that were treated, this main part was not treated since 1994 … [The] whole area has been treated and they’ll have protection, not just this fire season but for fire seasons to come. This wasn’t the intent of the burn at the time. We are glad we got it in, but we never wanted to see this amount of escalation on that fire ground. Shepherd hopes firefighters can declare the fire out towards the end of the week. Blood demand is at a 12-year high and plasma is even more in need, AAP reports, sparking a call for Australians to roll up their sleeves. The Red Cross is urging 100,000 Australians – the same number who will fill the MCG for the AFL grand final on Saturday – to donate for the first time over the next year. More than 560,000 people actively donate to maintain the population’s blood and plasma supply. However, new donors are needed to keep up with the growing nation. Executive director of donor experience Cath Stone said: We know 100,000 people will show up if they have a compelling reason to do so, like cheering on their team at the MCG. We’re calling on 100,000 people to find their reason to show up to donate blood and plasma. Demand for blood has increased 10% in the past four years while the demand for plasma is even more, reaching an all-time high. The Red Cross now collects more blood than plasma with the substance used to treat more than 50 serious medical conditions. Stone said with Australia’s ageing population and advances in treatment options, more donors are needed. Gallagher claims negotiation not happening ‘behind office doors’ with Greens on help to buy scheme Circling back to Katy Gallagher’s interview on ABC News Breakfast: she was asked about negotiations around the help-to-buy scheme, and if the government would work with the Greens to pass this? The finance minister responded: We’ve been trying to negotiate with them. I think the housing minister, [Clare] O’Neil, has met with their housing spokesperson. They’re not trying to negotiate. They are saying we want to negotiate in the media, but behind the office doors there’s none of that happening. She said that Peter Dutton and Adam Bandt were “working together” to stop the scheme. I mean, I don’t know how you … say you’re after improvements in housing and then vote against a help-to-buy scheme which is about trying to get people into home ownership. But that’s what happened last week. The RBA waving the threat around this morning is just another example of the Greens political party and the Liberal party working together. For more on this, Paul Karp spoke with Full Story host Nour Haydar on all things housing last week: Anthony Albanese is returning from the Quad summit to a close battle with the opposition for voter sentiment, according to the latest polls. As AAP reports, support is equal for the prime minister and the opposition leader Peter Dutton, with each notching 35% in one gauge of voter sentiment. The remaining 30% remain undecided, according to Resolve Political Monitor analysis for the Sydney Morning Herald, based on responses from 4,620 voters between July and September. Albanese leads Dutton in the two most populous states of Victoria (39% to 33%) and NSW (36% to 34%), the newspaper reports. As parliament resumes after the winter break, the latest Newspoll conducted for the Australian has Labor and the Coalition neck-and-neck on a two-party-preferred basis for the third time since May 2022. Cost-of-living and inflation pressures are continuing to add pressure to the Labor government, while the Coalition has increased its primary vote lead to an equal post-election high. However, its seven-point lead on first preferences isn’t enough to put the Liberals and Nationals into an election-winning position. Indeed, the majority of voters – 57% – believe a minority Labor or minority Coalition government is the most likely outcome at the next election. Gallagher on national debt and latest polling data Katy Gallagher was also asked about news that the final budget outcome will show gross debt in 2023-24 is $149.1bn lower than what Labor inherited at the time of the election, as Paul Karp reported earlier. The finance minister said it was “a huge difference”. So we continue to chip away at that. The less we have to borrow, the less interest we pay, the better the budget shape is in. And you know, that’s been a key part of Jim [Chalmers] and my approach to the budget is looking at ways we can invest in good, high quality services, but at the same time, getting the budget in much better shape than when we came to government. Host Patricia Karvelas asked if the “economic story” the government was telling was resonating with voters, given the Coalition had lifted to a stronger position nationwide? Gallagher responded: I don’t think it’s any surprise that people, when they’re feeling those cost of living pressures, will seek to attribute responsibility. Our job, though, is to turn up and continue to make the right economic decisions for the times that we’ve got right now … I’m not going to pretend it isn’t a complicated story to tell, and that, you know, the numbers that you’ll be talking about in the papers today, I think, reflect people’s experience of doing it tough at the moment. We’ll have more details on the latest polling numbers in a moment. Gallagher questioned on prospect of minority government Katy Gallagher was also asked about the prospect of a minority government, and where this places the government in terms of being able to work with the Greens. This was her full response: In the Senate, it’s a minority chamber. You work with everybody in in that chamber. It’s the Greens, there’s a very large crossbench, there’s the National Party and the Liberal Party. That is not unusual to have minority government in the Senate. So, in order to do anything PK, we’ve got 25 votes, we have to get 39, so it requires us to talk to people and work with people. But in terms of the election campaign – and I hope that people are engaging on some of these crazy ideas the Greens have, and the fact that Peter Dutton is blocking some sensible areas, like our Help to Buy scheme in the housing program, and see that the government is genuinely trying to push forward on both on all of these issues in the long term interests of this country. And that’s why we will continue to campaign for majority government. And there’s a lot of what ifs. It’s very hard to speculate what ifs. I mean, the Australian people have their say when the election is held, but we are certainly campaigning for majority government. Gallagher says government ‘not going to be threatened’ by Greens on RBA reform Host Patricia Karvelas: The two groups you need talking to you are not going to deliver what you’ve asked, so [the RBA reforms are] essentially dead. I mean, you might be keeping them on the table, but no one’s picking up what you’ve got on the table. Finance minister Katy Gallagher: Well, we remain committed to them, PK, and you know if – and I would say the more likely path is if Peter Dutton stops being stubborn and engages with us – there is a way through on this. I don’t know why they have dealt themselves out on this… They know this is good, sensible policy, and I would urge them to reconsider their opinion, their position, because we’re not going to go around being threatened, having the finger wave by Nick McKim saying that the government should rip up the way the bank the fiscal and monetary policy systems have worked in this country very successfully without political interference on the monetary policy side for decades. Katy Gallagher was also up on ABC RN this morning, where she was again asked about the Greens’ position regarding the RBA reforms. She responded: Well, I just think the Greens are out of control at the moment, full of self importance and out seeking populist approach to everything. It’s crazy what they’re saying to us. So if that’s their ultimatum – and you know, it’s a bit unseemly, Nick McKim going around issuing ultimatums – you know, no, we won’t work with that, because that is crazy. It’s economically irresponsible, and we won’t do it. Gallagher said that the government remained committed to the RBA reforms: They remain on the table. We’re pretty keen on them. So is the bank, and we certainly thought that the Reserve Bank support for these reforms would sway the Liberal Party… The treasurer has been working with the shadow treasurer closely on it, but they’ve dealt themselves out, for whatever reason… Gallagher accuses Greens of ‘trying to be populist’ During her interview on ABC News Breakfast just earlier, finance minister Katy Gallagher was asked about the Greens’ ultimatum – and whether she thinks that should happen or could happen? She responded: “I think the Greens are out of control at the moment” and there is “good reason” the bank is independent: [The Greens are] just trying to be populist, but [that] can cause a lot of damage at the same time… The Greens political party are teaming up with the Liberal Party. I think it’s Peter Dutton and Adam Bandt working together to frustrate sensible challenges that are in the long-term interests of the country. Our political correspondent Paul Karp has more on this topic, as we await the RBA’s announcement tomorrow: The Greens have said they won’t help pass Labor’s RBA reforms until interest rates are cut. In a statement, the party said that by cutting rates by 25 basis points, repayments on an average recent mortgage of $641,000 would reduce by around $100 a month, a saving of $1200 a year. The Greens said that once interest rates are reduced, the Greens would back the treasurer’s legislation to restructure the RBA – as long as two existing provisions are retained in their current form: the provision allowing the treasurer to override decisions of the RBA, and the provision allowing the RBA to direct the money they advance to commercial banks into productive parts of the economy. Senator Nick McKim said in a statement: The Treasurer has the power to step in, he’s just not using it. The Reserve Bank could act, but they are not acting… For weeks the treasurer has acknowledged the economy is being smashed, and that mortgage holders are being smashed by high interest rates – yet to date he’s done nothing about it despite having the power to reduce interest rates… We aren’t going to pass Labor’s Reserve Bank reforms until interest rates are cut. The Reserve Bank Board are not infallible high-priests of the economy who are above criticism… The Greens won’t support these reforms until either the RBA cuts interest rates or Dr Chalmers forces them to. Katy Gallagher questioned on tomorrow’s RBA rate announcement The Reserve Bank of Australia is meeting again this week, with another decision on rates expected tomorrow. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has been making the rounds this morning, speaking with ABC News Breakfast on this. Asked if she is worried the RBA will wait too long to cut rates, Gallagher responded that “we don’t comment on the decision of the Reserve Bank” – whose job is to bring down inflation while “our job is to make sure [we’re] helping people with cost of living”. Gallagher was asked if she is worried she will cop more blame and this could see a result at the ballot box? She responded: Governments have to deal with the economic circumstances that are there before us. We inherited an inflation challenge with a six in front of it, it’s moderated in welcome ways, but we get that people are doing it tough … We’re doing what we can whilst we’re trying to wrangle with this inflation challenge to make sure we’re helping people with the cost of living pressures they’re under. Damaging wind warning for parts of Tasmania In more weather news, a severe weather warning is in place for damaging winds across much of Tasmania today. The Bureau of Meteorology says an approaching cold front is tightening the pressure gradient across the state, resulting in vigorous westerly winds. Winds will start to ease once the front has crossed the state late this afternoon, however winds will remain gusty. Damaging westerly winds around 60-70km/h with gusts around 100km/h are likely across southern, central, and eastern parts of the state, including over Hobart. Meanwhile peak gusts around 120 km/h are possible about the eastern coastal strip district between Scamander and Swansea, as well as exposed and elevated areas of the state. Locations which may be affected include St Helens, Swansea, New Norfolk, Hobart, Geeveston and Dover. Prepare to leave warning for Queensland town amid fire A “prepare to leave” warning remans in place for the rural Queensland town of Lakeland, amid a fast-moving fire. According to the Queensland Fire Department, the fire is burning along Mulligan Highway towards Peninsula Developmental Road. Conditions may get worse quickly, it said, with firefighters working to contain the blaze. The department said some properties are at risk and the fire is likely to impact the community in the coming hours. Meanwhile, a fire ban for southwest Queensland is in place from today to Wednesday, due to heightened fire conditions. This will cover Toowoomba, the Southern Downs, Western Downs, Goondiwindi, Maranoa, Balonne, Murweh, Paroo, Quilpie and Bulloo LGAs. Australia has jumped one place in the Lowy Institute’s annual Asia Power Index, largely due to Russia going backwards as a result of its war in Ukraine. The thinktank ranks 27 countries and territories to rank their relative power in Asia. It is based on 131 indicators across eight broad themes: military capability, defence networks, economic capability, economic relationships, diplomatic influence, cultural influence, resilience and future resources. In its 2024 report, released last night, the Lowy Institute continued to rank the United States in first place and China in second place, although Beijing was steadily eroding Washington’s comparative military capability advantage: For the first time, experts surveyed for the Asia Power Index judged that China is better able to deploy rapidly and for a sustained period in the event of an interstate conflict in Asia. The report said India’s power in Asia was growing and it had overtaken Japan to take third place for its comprehensive power for the first time. After Japan in fourth place, Australia was ranked fifth in the 2024 index, an improvement from the sixth place it held last year. Australia has traded places with Russia, the report said, because the latter’s “relevance to Asia is declining as its war on Ukraine saps resources and focus”. This increase in ranking, Australia’s second since the inception of the Asia Power Index (it surpassed South Korea in 2020), is more a function of Russia’s decline since 2018 than Australia’s rise. The report also noted that south-east Asia’s most populous countries, Indonesia and the Philippines, were becoming more influential. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has revealed that the final budget outcome will show that gross debt in 2023-24 is $149.1bn lower than what Labor inherited at the time of the election. It will show gross debt at the end of 2023-24 was $906.9bn compared with the pre-election fiscal outlook which projected gross debt would exceed a trillion dollars last year. Yesterday, Chalmers also revealed the final budget outcome will be a surplus in the “mid teens” rather than the $9.3bn projected in May. In a statement, he said: Through responsible economic management and spending restraint we’ve been able to get rid of a big chunk of the debt left to us by the Liberals and Nationals. Lower debt saves taxpayers on interest costs, helps in the fight against inflation and makes more room in the budget for what matters most like Medicare, aged care and defence. Our economic plan is all about easing pressure on people at the same time as we fight inflation and get the budget in much better nick and this shows we’re making meaningful progress. Back-to-back surpluses are helping in the fight against inflation and reducing the interest costs on a trillion dollars of Liberal party debt we inherited. We’re the first government to post back-to-back surpluses in nearly two decades. Good morning, and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be with you most of this Monday as we bring you our rolling coverage. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has revealed a $149bn cut to national debt under Labor. The final budget outcome will show gross debt at the end of 2023-24 was $906.9bn, compared with the pre-election fiscal outlook which projected gross debt would exceed a trillion dollars last year, he said. Back-to-back surpluses are helping in the fight against inflation and reducing the interest costs on a trillion dollars of Liberal Party debt we inherited.

                    "headline": "Garmin Fenix 8 review: best adventure watch becomes smarter",
                    "bodyText": "The Fenix 8 is a landmark moment for Garmin. By adding voice control, an OLED screen and other niceties, it has merged its top Fenix and Epix adventure watch lines to better compete with increasingly advanced smartwatches from Apple, Samsung and other major players. The Fenix has always been where Garmin debuts its technology and features first before trickling them down into other products, such as the popular Forerunner series. It certainly feels more modern, but at £870 (€1,000/$1,000/A$1,699) – a £120 or so increase over its already pricy predecessor – these new advances including diving tracking and AI assistant access do not come cheap. The Fenix 8 still has Garmin’s signature combination of five physical buttons and touchscreen, unapologetically rugged-but-premium looks and even has a new metal guard on the side to protect some of its sensors. New “leakproof” buttons are ready for diving. The screen is a bright and crisp OLED from the Epix line and looks far fancier than the low-power LCD displays the Fenix has traditionally used. The interface has also been revamped to be more modern and responsive. There is haptic feedback for actions across the board, including vibrations for the buttons since they no longer physically click, which takes some getting used to. Swipe down from the top and you get a new notifications panel like you might on an Apple watch. Notifications are colour coded to the app and, at least when paired to an Android, you can see pictures and quickly reply to messages sent to you. Notifications from an iPhone are limited to read-only text. A microphone and speaker allow access to a couple of new things, such as calls and the voice assistant from your phone. Calls work fine for short conversations, but not much more. Accessing Siri or Google Assistant from your wrist is a bit clunky and tinny but still handy for changing things on your phone remotely. Press the button, wait for little microphone animation and ask your question. More interesting is the new voice command function, which works offline. It is basic and a little slow with a “processing” time of a second or so, but works as a quicker way of performing actions, such as starting a timer, opening settings or getting to a metric buried a few menu options deep. Setting a timer quickly via voice is an absolute must-have for me on a smartwatch, and something that Garmin has lacked till now. The watch can also record voice notes, which are very handy for recording those moments of inspiration you might have while out on a run or ride without your phone. Specifications Screen: 1.3 or 1.4in AMOLED Case size: 43, 47 or 51mm Case thickness: 13.8 or 14.7mm Band size: 20, 22 or 26mm quick fit Weight: 44 to 74g body only Storage: 32GB Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: Multi-band GNSS, compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox, depth Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi 4 Go anywhere, track anything The Fenix 8 packs some of the most comprehensive activity and fitness tracking available on any device. It has the same super-accurate dual band GPS and fifth-gen optical heart rate sensor as its predecessor, which is as good as a chest strap for most purposes. It tracks more than 100 different activities out of the box with more available to download via the Connect IQ store. Whatever you want to do there will be an activity profile for it. New for the Fenix line is diving to 40m depths using some of the features that have made Garmin’s dedicated Decent dive computers popular. Of course the Fenix 8 excels at more mundane activities, such as running by tracking every metric you could want similar to its predecessor, including running dynamics and tools for race day. The torch can even be used as a strobing running light for visibility at night. Garmin’s general health tracking is also very capable, covering most heart, energy, sleep and day-to-day activities, including recovery from training sessions. ECG measurements are currently only available in the US and some parts of Asia, not in the UK, Europe or Australia. The Garmin Connect IQ app store has a growing library of third-party apps, including thousands of watch faces, extra data fields, apps for different workouts and fitness equipment, navigation apps, weather apps and music apps such as Spotify for offline playback. The watch has Garmin Pay for contactless payments, though bank support is limited compared with rivals. The OLED screen does reduce the battery life of the watch compared with the LCDs of predecessors, which lasted in excess of 22 days. The 47mm version of the Fenix 8 manages a little more than seven days between charges with the screen on all the time and 2.5 hours of running with offline Spotify. That is very good for an OLED watch, lasting three to four times as long as main smartwatch rivals and a little longer than the Epix it replaces. The smaller 43mm model has shorter battery life by a few days, while the bigger 51mm version should last around 13 days between charges. Sustainability The Fenix 8 is generally repairable. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees at least two years of security updates from release but typically supports its devices far longer. It offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling laws. Price The Fenix 8 AMOLED series starts at £869.99 (€999.99/$999.99/A$1,699) and reaches £1,119.99 for the most expensive model. Solar-charging models with LCD screens start at £949 (€1,099.99/$1,099.99/A$1,849). For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 965 costs £499.99, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 costs £799, the Coros Vertix 2s costs £599 and the Sunnto Vertical costs £445. Verdict The Fenix 8 is undoubtedly a step in the right direction for Garmin in its competition with the likes of Apple and Samsung. It is able to perform more of the functions that have become smartwatch staples, such as access to voice assistants. The crisp OLED screen looks far better than the low-power LCDs that made Garmin’s most expensive watches still look a bit cheap and basic in the past. I think it is worth the trade-off in battery life as it still lasts a solid seven days between charges, and there are solar-charging versions available with utilitarian LCDs if you really need it to last longer. Garmin is unrivalled in its tracking of sports and hundreds of activity metrics. I don’t think any one person is going to use all of what the Fenix 8 can do, but you’ll struggle to find a sport or activity it can’t track in some way. The torch on the top is an everyday bonus tool you’ll wonder how you lived without, and there’s no other watch I’d rather rely on to get me home when lost hiking in the middle of nowhere. But as great as it is, the increased price stings for an already costly watch. And though improved, Garmin’s smartwatch functions are still far behind an Apple or Wear OS watch in capability. Pros: great OLED screen, tracks practically everything, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, 7+ day battery life, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, 100-metre water resistance and 40M diving, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS. Cons: extremely expensive, limited Garmin Pay bank support, voice features are slow, still limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches."

                    "bodyText": "In 2013, US robotics company Boston Dynamics revealed its new robot, Atlas. Unveiled at the Darpa Robotics Challenge, the 6ft 2in humanoid could walk on uneven ground, jump off boxes, and even climb stairs. It was like a vision frequently depicted in fiction: a robot designed to operate like us, able to take on all manner of everyday tasks. It seemed like the dawn of something. Robots were going to do all of our boring and arduous chores, and step up as elderly care workers to boot. Since then, we’ve seen leaps forward in artificial intelligence (AI), from computer vision to machine learning. The recent wave of large language models and generative AI systems opens up new opportunities for human-computer interaction. But outside of research labs, physical robots remain largely restricted to factories and warehouses, performing very specific tasks, often behind a safety cage. Home robots are limited to vacuum cleaners and lawnmowers – not exactly Rosie the Robot. “Robotic bodies haven’t developed substantially since the 1950s,” says Jenny Read, director of the robotics programme at the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), the UK government’s research and development body, established last year. “I’m not saying there’s been no advances, but when you look at what’s happened in computing and software, it’s really striking how little there’s been.” Developing a robot simply takes more resources, says Nathan Lepora, a professor of robotics and AI at Bristol University. A talented individual with a computer can write an algorithm, but building a robot requires access to the physical device. “It’s a lot slower, and it’s a lot harder,” he says. “That’s fundamentally the reason why robotics is lagging behind AI.” Research labs and companies hope to bridge this gap, with a slate of new humanoid robots in development and some starting to hit the market. Boston Dynamics retired its original hydraulic Atlas model in April and revealed a new, electric version that it intends to commercialise in the next few years and will start testing in Hyundai factories next year. Oregon-based Agility Robotics claims its Digit robot is the first humanoid to actually get paid for a job, moving boxes in a logistics facility. Elon Musk insists that Tesla’s humanoid robot, known as Optimus or Tesla Bot, will start working in its car factories next year. But there’s still a long way to go before we see robots operating outside of tightly controlled environments. Advances in AI can only take us so far with the current hardware, says Read – and for many tasks, a robot’s physical capabilities are critical. Generative AI systems can write poetry or make pictures, but they can’t do the dirty and dangerous jobs we most want to automate. For those, you need more than a brain in a box. * * * A useful robot design often starts with hands. “Many of the use cases for robots really depend on being able to handle things precisely and skilfully without damaging the object,” says Read. Humans are very good at this. We can instinctively switch between lifting a dumbbell to handling an eggshell, or from chopping a carrot to stirring a sauce. We also have excellent tactile sensing, demonstrated by our ability to read Braille. In comparison, robots struggle. Read’s Aria programme, which is backed by £57m of funding, is focused on this problem. One of the challenges of robot dexterity is scale, says Rich Walker, director of London-based Shadow Robot. In the company’s office in Camden, he shows off the Shadow Dexterous Hand. It’s the size of a man’s hand, with four fingers and a thumb, and joints that mimic knuckles. But while the digits look dainty, the hand is attached to a robot arm much wider than a human forearm, chock-full of electronics, cabling, actuators and everything else needed to operate the hand. “It’s a packing problem,” Walker says. An advantage of a human-scale hand is that it’s the right size and shape to handle human tools. Walker gives the example of a laboratory pipette, which he’s modified with Sugru, a mouldable adhesive, to make it more ergonomic. You could attach a pipette tool directly to a robot hand, but then it would only be able to use a pipette and not, say, a pair of scissors, or a screwdriver. But a completely human-like hand is not best for every task. Shadow Robot’s most recent hand, DEX-EE, looks rather alien. It has three digits, more like thumbs than fingers, which are notably bigger than a human’s and are covered in tactile sensors. The company designed it in collaboration with Google DeepMind, Alphabet’s AI research lab, which wanted a robot hand that could learn how to pick things up by repeatedly trying to do so – a trial-and-error approach known as reinforcement learning. But this posed challenges: robot hands are usually designed expressly not to crash into things, and are prone to break if they do so. Murilo Martins, a DeepMind research engineer, says that when he ran experiments with the original Dexterous Hand, “every half an hour I would break a tendon”. DEX-EE prioritises robustness: a video shows the three digits happily opening and closing while being struck by a mallet. Its bigger size accommodates larger pulleys, which put less stress on the wire tendons, meaning it can reliably operate for at least 300 hours. Even so, says Maria Bauza, a DeepMind research scientist, time with the robot is precious. Last week, DeepMind published research outlining a new training method it calls DemoStart. This takes the same trial-and-error approach but starts by using a simulated robot hand instead of a real one. After training the simulated hand to complete tasks such as tightening a nut and bolt, the researchers transferred this learned behaviour to the real DEX-EE hand. “The hands still have gone through thousands and thousands of experiments,” Bauza says. “It’s just that we don’t make them start from scratch.” This reduces the time and cost of running experiments, making it easier to train robots that can adapt to different tasks. The skills don’t always transfer perfectly, however; while DeepMind’s simulated robot hand was able to insert a plug into a socket 99.6% of the time, the real hand only managed it 64% of the time. The work is an example of how developments in AI and robot bodies go hand-in-robot-hand. Only through physical interactions can robots truly make sense of their environment. After all, Read points out, the large language models behind text generators such as ChatGPT were trained on a huge corpus of human language shared on the internet, “but where do I get the data about what it feels like to pick a strawberry or to make a sandwich?” As the DeepMind robotics team writes: “A large language model could tell you how to tighten a bolt or tie your shoes, but even if it was embodied in a robot, it wouldn’t be able to perform those tasks itself.” Martins goes a step further. He believes robotics is critical to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), the broad, human-equivalent intelligence many AI researchers dream of. He reasons that an AI can only really understand our world if it has a physical form. “To me, AGI doesn’t exist without an embodiment, much in the same way that human intelligence doesn’t exist without us having our own bodies,” he says. * * * Hands, though important, are just one body part. While Shadow Robot and others focus on fingers, an increasing number of companies and labs are developing full humanoids. The appeal of humanoids may partly be psychological. “It’s the robot that we were all expecting – it’s like C3PO,” says Walker. But there is also a logic to using the human form as a muse. “We designed all of our environments around people,” says Jonathan Hurst, Agility Robotics’s co-founder and chief robot officer. “So having a roughly human form factor is a very good way to be able to locomote and manipulate and coexist with people.” But a humanoid may not be the best design for every job. A wheeled robot could go anywhere a wheelchair user can, and when it comes to trickier terrain, four legs may be better than two. Boston Dynamics’s dog-like Spot can scamper across rough ground or stairs and self-right if it falls – something two-legged robots struggle with. “Just because a humanoid robot takes a similar form as a human doesn’t mean it needs to move that way and be constrained by the limitations of our joints,” adds a Boston Dynamics spokesperson, over email. For now, humanoids are still finding their feet. Flashy videos and sleek designs may give people an unrealistic sense of how capable or reliable they are, says Bristol University’s Lepora. Boston Dynamics’s clips are impressive, but the company is also known for its blooper reels showing its robot fails. In January, Musk shared a video of Optimus folding a shirt – but keen-eyed viewers spotted telltale signs that the robot was being teleoperated. A major challenge in bringing robots out of labs and industrial environments and into homes or public spaces is safety. In June, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) launched a study group to explore standards specifically for humanoid robots. Aaron Prather, the group’s chair, explains that a humanoid in a shared space is a different proposition to an industrial robot encased in protective caging. “It’s one thing for them to interact with a fellow worker at an Amazon facility or a Ford factory, because that’s a trained worker working with that robot,” he says. “[But if] I put that robot out in the public park, how’s it going to interact with kids? How’s it going to interact with folks that don’t understand what’s going on?” Hurst envisages robots in the retail sector as a next step, stocking shelves or working in back rooms. Prather believes we’ll soon see robots waiting tables. For many applications, however, it may not make financial sense to use a robot. Walker gives the example of a delivery robot. “It’s got to be cost effective [compared] with someone on a minimum-wage, zero-hours contract on an e-scooter,” he says. Most of the roboticists I spoke with said a multipurpose home robot – the kind that can do your dishes, wash your laundry and walk your dog – is a way off. “The era of a useful humanoid is here, but the path to a truly general-purpose humanoid robot will be long and hard and is many years away,” says Boston Dynamics. Care robots, often hyped as the solution to ageing populations, will be a particularly tough prospect, says Read. “Let’s get to the point where a robot can reliably disassemble a laptop or make you a sandwich, and then we’ll think about how it might care for an elderly person,” she says. That’s if we even want robots to take on care work. Just like art and poetry, perhaps some roles are still best with a human touch."

                    "bodyText": "It all started – or stop-started, perhaps – with some tiny pterodactyls. As 1924 drew to a close, Marcel Delgado was putting the finishing touches to 50 model dinosaurs. For months, the sculptor had been meticulously constructing a range of Tyrannosaurus rexes, brontosauruses and pterodactyls. Now he was getting ready to pass them on to pioneering animator Willis O’Brien, who would painstakingly move each creature an almost imperceptible amount, shoot another frame, and then repeat the process. A year later, The Lost World – the first ever feature film using what was termed “stop-motion” – was released, transforming Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel of the same name into an action-packed spectacle. Audiences were astounded, even dumbfounded by its seemingly supernatural special effects. To modern eyes, the film itself is a bit of a dinosaur. Its technology is prehistoric, its colonialist themes outdated and its animated sequences clunky. But the meteoric impact of these miniature dinosaurs is still felt; a century later, stop-motion cinema is very much alive and flicking. “Stop-motion animation is often overlooked. But it’s a really important part of cinema history,” says Justin Johnson, lead programmer of a BFI season on the art form, Stop Motion: Celebrating Handmade Animation on the Big Screen. Aptly, the genre’s own timeline is a stuttering one. After The Lost World, a golden age emerged; O’Brien became a famed animator, working with Delgado on 1933’s King Kong. Then, in 1940, animator George Pal pioneered the technique of “replacement animation” – designing multiple wooden heads for puppets to facilitate an array of facial expressions. Visual effects auteur Ray Harryhausen took things further with “dynamation” which sandwiched models between live-action footage of a background and foreground. For the first time, it allowed animated characters and real-life actors to interact; in 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts, for example, the titular heroes are attacked by a skeleton crew of, well, skeletons. Stop-motion also took over the small screen, with playful children’s TV series such as Trumpton and Clangers winning over kids and adults alike. Clay animation, too, became popular, thanks in part to the shapeshifting plasticine man Morph. The beloved terracotta character was the brainchild of Aardman Animations, founded in 1972 by Peter Lord and David Sproxton. It would go on to craft a string of beloved characters all cast in the same eccentric mould, including Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Rocky Rhodes, Chicken Run’s plucky rooster. An early hit for the studio came in 1986, when Aardman animated the visuals for Peter Gabriel’s smash hit Sledgehammer. The video was an MTV mainstay in the late 80s and went on to bag a record nine trophies at the network’s VMAs. But as stop-motion techniques rapidly improved, so did a less laborious new alternative: CGI. Ironically, it was yet another dinosaur film – 1993’s Jurassic Park – that almost killed stop-motion. Steven Spielberg had originally hired animator Phil Tippett to work on the dinosaur effects. But Industrial Light &amp; Magic, George Lucas’s special effects studio, instead proposed a new CGI approach. “I’ve just become extinct,” Tippett quipped. Tippett was only half right. While CGI has become the go-to way for film-makers to ape reality, 1993 also brought two gamechangers that would demonstrate the technology’s creative possibilities. The first was The Nightmare Before Christmas, Tim Burton’s macabre festive triumph. Directed by animator Henry Selick, the film’s 109,440 frames saw Jack Skellington and the ghoulish residents of Halloween Town come to life in phantasmagoric detail. Then, on Boxing Day, Aardman’s short film Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Wrong Trousers was released in the UK. A commercial smash, it would go on to win the Oscar for best animated short. Among those it inspired was Will Becher, whose fanmail to the studio later landed him a role making plasticine wings for Chicken Run. Now, he is a lead director who helmed the acclaimed A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon. “Aardman’s stories come from a place of character and comedy. They’re very British,” he says. “It’s bold and poppy, all about goofy, googly eyes and brows and big mouth shapes.” In the 21st century, it’s notable that many of the greatest stop-motion successes have been in children’s horror, with plasticine faces falling in just the right part of the uncanny valley to be both cute and creepy. In 2009, Selick’s Coraline became the third highest-grossing stop-motion film ever, bagging awards for its otherworldly tale of a young girl opening a door to a sublimely strange and unsettling world. The film was created by Laika Studios, founded in 2005 in Portland by Travis Knight, son of Nike founder Phil. The studio has followed up the success of Coraline ($172m at the global box office) with films including ParaNorman, Missing Link and The Boxtrolls. Laika is at the cutting edge of the art form: in order to make its fantasies a reality, the studio uses 3D printing and some CGI, a tightrope act between tradition and technology. Laika has transported five of its miniature sets over to the UK for the BFI season. Each display represents a reconstruction of a single keyframe from a different Laika film, lasting just one 24th of a second on screen. For all their irreverence, painstaking, tortuous work goes on behind the scenes of these productions. The art requires extreme dedication and delayed gratification. Every single move is minute; and it takes hours, or often days, to create seconds. It’s why many films end up banished to development hell. “But if you fall in love with the process, you can lose yourself in time,” Becher says. Having survived two dinosaur attacks, stop-motion animation is now under siege from the robots: AI threatens to leave more time-consuming techniques in the dust. But stop-motion, when used for cinematic effect rather than special effects, is still going strong; more experimental directors have taken matters into their own hands over the last few decades. Wes Anderson, for example, has embraced the form for Fantastic Mr Fox and Isle of Dogs; Charlie Kaufman used it to explore loneliness and ennui in Anomalisa; and Guillermo del Toro won an Oscar for 2022’s whimsical Pinocchio. As well as providing the ultimate challenge, these auteurs are using it for the complete control it gives you over set, character and story. “Stop-motion allows you to have a blank canvas and go anywhere your mind takes you to,” Johnson thinks. Sometimes, that can be somewhere sinister. Last year, Robert Morgan continued his journey into the darker side of the genre with Stopmotion, a horror that sees an animator’s models turn into demonic forms. And with the gift of a new Wallace and Gromit film, Vengeance Most Fowl, this Christmas, Laika’s dark fantasy Wildwood slated for next year and Del Toro’s The Buried Giant on the way for Netflix, stop-motion isn’t slowing down. Even Pixar has shone a spotlight on the art form for the first time ever this year with its new short Self, a fable about a wooden doll wishing upon a star. According to Becher, the form’s ongoing appeal to audiences is simple – people appreciate the craft. “There is some sort of understanding that what they’re seeing is a bit magic, something inanimate that’s moving by itself,” Becher explains. But it’s also because the techniques have been eclipsed by new tech that they retain a certain authenticity. “It’s about celebrating imperfection. It’s fine if you have a thumbprint on a plasticine model. It actually enhances it,” Johnson says. “The animators are channelling themselves into the figure. It can’t be replicated with CGI, it just isn’t possible.” Stop Motion: Celebrating Handmade Animation on the Big Screen is at BFI Southbank, London, to 9 October."

                    "bodyText": "Is London a little bit tame for Nate Silver? The stats expert known for his hugely influential US election model is in town promoting a new book about risk, and can’t help noticing all the ways in which we play it safe on this side of the Atlantic. “You go to the tube in London and they have guard doors, which they don’t have in the subway in New York.” (He’s evidently been riding the Elizabeth line). Or, “You’re in an Uber and you don’t put your seatbelt on in the back seat, and there’s like the very polite British beeping,” he says, with a disarming, high-velocity giggle. Not that he minds too much – you get the impression he’s fond of the city, where he spent a year as a student, and in any case “both countries are making different trade-offs” – the US has less regulation and higher growth, but lower life expectancy: the very definition of live fast, die young. It’s clear, though, where he feels most at home. “I spent a lot of time in casinos over the course of writing this book,” he confesses in the opening pages of On the Edge, describing one in Florida that boasts “200 gaming tables, 1,275 guest rooms, 3,000 slot machines and a glimmering guitar-shaped hotel that shoots beams of neon blue light 20,000ft into the sky”. A far-cry from the sedate charm of the Royal Society of Arts, where he sits, in a baseball cap and T-shirt, munching chocolate brought by his PR for a much-needed blood sugar boost (“It’s eight hours of back-to-back stuff today”). To go by his new taxonomy of contemporary power, we’re very much in “The Village”; that dopamine-doused casino he described is part of “The River”. This is a slightly confusing choice of image, but it works once you get used to it – the idea being that the River is free-flowing, disparate, full of exciting rapids and cataracts. It encompasses poker tournaments, Vegas, venture capital and Silicon Valley, and its inhabitants (he calls them “Riverians”) range from anonymous blackjack players to Elon Musk and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried – at least until the latter took up residence in a California correctional facility. Its mindset is highly analytical, somewhat contrarian and frequently thrill-seeking. But it’s more than a curious outgrowth of advanced capitalism, Silver says; in an era of breakneck technological change, it will play an outsize role in determining the shape of society, and our collective futures. “The Village” is easier to grasp: stolid, slow moving, it’s home to norms and orthodoxies, legacy media, universities, government departments. Villagers read the Guardian and the New York Times. Silver, who studied economics before becoming a professional poker player, then a political forecaster, sees himself as having a foot in both camps, though he’s upfront about being a Riverian at heart. On the Edge is his guide to this landscape, and his attempt to bridge the divide. He tells me: “I want the Village and the River to understand one another better.” His relationship to the former is complicated, though. Silver came to wider attention on the back of the 2008 presidential election, when his electoral model correctly predicted the winner in 49 out of 50 states, at a time when many still found it hard to believe an African American really would win the White House. In 2010 the New York Times brought him on board, and in the 2012 contest between Obama and Mitt Romney, he scored a perfect 50 (as well as writing an unlikely bestseller about statistical thinking, The Signal and the Noise). By the time 2016 rolled around, his website FiveThirtyEight.com had been acquired by the sports network ESPN and, in desperately anxious times, was treated as having prophetic powers. Indeed, worried liberals constantly refreshing his electoral college map helped make it “way too popular”, Silver has written, pointing out that analytics firm Chartbeat rated his forecast “literally the most engaging piece of content on the English-speaking Internet” that year (second place went to the BBC’s Brexit Liveblog). His model gave Clinton a 71% chance of winning – much lower than most others – but when she didn’t, well, “the reaction of many people in the political world … was: ‘Nate Silver is a fucking idiot.’” From his point of view, they simply didn’t understand what he was doing. In terms of probability, Trump’s victory wasn’t remotely out of the blue – if there was a roughly one in three chance of a storm, you’d probably put your raincoat on. We now find ourselves in the middle of another highly uncertain election, and political junkies are once more turning to Silver for their fix – though this time the destination is his substack, Silver Bulletin. (The FiveThirtyEight brand is now owned by ABC, but Silver retains the rights to his model. “I make far more from the newsletter than from anything else,” he tells me, refusing to put a number on it.) His prognostications make an impact: a few days after our interview, Trump held a press conference at which he said: “If you look at the, uh, Nate Silver – very respected guy, I don’t know him – but he has me up by a lot.” Does he worry that people are misusing or misinterpreting his forecasts this time around? “No,” he says, without hesitation. “No. I mean, people are going to interpret these polls however they can, and we have a way that’s empirically sound to do that, and has a track record over 16 years. I’m not paternalistic, right? We’re providing good information. We provide a lot of context about it … I’m old-school traditionalist, and I believe: provide people with good information, and that empowers them to make better decisions.” On the morning we speak, a week before the presidential debate, the model gives Trump a 58% chance of winning the electoral college and Harris a 60% chance of winning the popular vote. This far out, however, it’s essentially a toss-up. Perhaps surprisingly, given the popular image of stats nerds as robot-like savants, On the Edge sets a lot of store by intuition, describing how poker players use a kind of spidey-sense to tell if their opponent is bluffing. “I give, I think, more weight to intuition and emotional judgment as actually adding value, rather than being something that you have to just push back against,” he tells me. This is a shift from The Signal and the Noise, which he says “was kind of naive about the idea that [if we’re just] more data driven, we’ll solve our problems”. Does he have a gut feeling, then, about who’s going to win? “Maybe,” he says, before embarking on a characteristically intricate explanation of how it would be less trustworthy in this context because “everyone’s brains get very politicised during an election campaign”, and he’s a Harris supporter. Perhaps he’s reluctant to undercut his model with a statement either way? “If I had a strong intuition, I’d tell you, right … but I don’t, for the time being.” Just how useful is a forecast in a knife-edge election like this one, anyway? Even the insight that it could go either way is useful, Silver argues. “One potential advantage of having a forecast that says … it’s 50/50, is that people should be making their contingency plans, like, right away. It doesn’t mean you need [to stockpile] ammo and peanut butter” – that giggle again – “but it means, you know: what’s your strategy to protect American institutions in the event of a Trump second term? Or, in 2028 [or] 2032, a Trump-like Republican who maybe is more effective than Trump? If I were a liberal donor, for example, I would want to begin funding now … to protect institutions in that eventuality, instead of giving another $100,000 to Kamala Harris, who has more money than she needs.” And while he fears a Trump win – “There were a lot of guardrails in place last time that prevented complete and utter disaster, but those guardrails have been weakened, right?” – he warns against painting it as an existential threat to democracy, at least as a political strategy. “The notion of basically holding voters hostage in that sense is very unappealing … Biden was like: ‘OK, sure, I may be running for president until I’m 86 and can barely form a complete sentence, but if you don’t vote for me, the country gets it’ – that’s a very unappealing message to swing voters … whereas Harris brings more joyfulness and is obviously a very talented woman”. He worries, though, that she has “retained too many of the Biden people who thought it was a good idea to keep running [him]. I guess she kind of had to.” Not all Riverians are as enthusiastic about Harris’ candidacy. Among them is Elon Musk, who, commenting on Trump’s adoption of his idea of a “government efficiency commission” to slash spending and regulation, told followers “I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises”. In Silver’s view, buying Twitter, now X, has gone to his head. “I think [it was] a pretty bad financial bet. But in terms of cultural influence, it has shifted the discourse rightward in the US among elites quite a bit. But, you know, you get on a winning streak, and I think you tend to get a bit cocky… I wish that Elon Musk weren’t the most identifiable Riverian,” he says, cringing slightly. “The era when Elon could say, ‘Oh, I’m just a moderate’. I mean, we’re well past that… He’s been very pilled by right wing memes, some of his own making.” (Pilled, if you don’t know, is an extremely-online bit of jargon that here means something like “converted”.) As a very high-frequency user of the site, how does Silver feel about the way it’s changed? “I think it’s less terrible than the pandemic era version … where it was used by the Village to police dissent and really criticise people who had very reasonable positions.” His stance on Covid was pro-vaccine, lockdown sceptical, which sometimes put him at odds with the consensus. “In the pre-Elon era, there was a ton of group thinking. You got absolutely pilloried for it. And this is at least more pluralistic.” He also thinks “the whole misinformation thing is bullshit, at least to a first approximation”, with too many “labelling ideas that are inconvenient politically as misinformation”. He cites kneejerk dismissal of the Covid lab-leak theory as well as attempts to “label concerns about Joe Biden’s age as misinformation or deep fakes”. But is this really the Village? Or just hand-to-hand combat on social media? I point out that the lab leak theory was investigated with an open mind by mainstream academics. The FBI – hardly a Riverian outpost – concluded that it was the most likely explanation. “They correct after about a year or two,” he says of Village institutions, noting that the Democrats also eventually replaced Biden. “That’s a good sign” – but he clearly feels a certain nimbleness is lacking. And on misinformation, what about Musk’s tweeting of a counterfeit – and highly inflammatory – Daily Telegraph headline during the recent UK riots? “This is why you need people that are capable of understanding political partisanship, and turning the lens on themselves, and not paternalism, right?” Keeping the threshold for dismissing something high actually increases trust, he argues. “So false videos about these riots, or election conspiracy theories in the US, or QAnon or vaccine conspiracy theories, I think those are things that are properly labelled as misinformation. Dismissing a perfectly plausible lab leak theory, or saying, ‘Oh, Hunter Biden’s laptop’ … that’s very damaging to the credibility of the Village.” (Initially dismissed as Russian fakes, incriminating emails discovered on Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop were later found to be authentic). Silver is notably spiky on X, getting aggro with people who disparage his model or practices. When Stanford professor Justin Grimmer made a fairly common criticism of political forecasting – that elections happen too infrequently for us to calculate probabilities with any kind of accuracy (or, as he put it: “The paucity of outcome data means that election forecasters have to make educated guesses about how to build their statistical models”), Silver batted him away as one of those “boring academics who can’t model for shit”. He varies the charge slightly when we meet, calling him instead a “boring-ass academic who has, like, no actual skills in statistical inference”. Isn’t this kind of thing quite corrosive of human relationships? “I think if people took Twitter less seriously, it would be better. Like, we’re just goofing off and having fun here ... It’s very American and un-British of me, right? I don’t believe [in] acting in fake good faith toward people that make these lazy bad faith criticisms – 80% of the time you ignore it, but 20% of the time you counterpunch.” Call me British, but I do think the fact that so many people – and Silver may be one of them – seem about 80% nicer in person than on X should give us pause. And while social media clearly isn’t the biggest problem facing humanity, Musk’s stewardship of it does speak to an inherent problem with Riverian power. It’s one Silver alludes to in his chapters about jailed entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, whom he interviewed several times (“He’s a strange person,” whose approach to risk was “irrational and kind of insane”). Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, was eventually imprisoned for stealing billions of dollars from investors who used his cryptocurrency trading platform, FTX. Silver quotes testimony from a prosecution witness: SBF “would be happy to flip a coin if it came up tails and the world was destroyed, as long as if it came up heads the world would be, like, more than twice as good”. As it turned out, this gung-ho attitude merely led to his own ruin. But the fallout could easily have been much wider. Silver points out that SBF invested heavily in artificial intelligence company Anthropic, and it’s conceivable he could have ended up as CEO of a major AI company at a time when concerns about the technology’s potential to transform or even destroy society are being seriously debated. As he writes towards the end of the book, “Silicon Valley selects for highly (over)confident founders – people who are willing to gamble big on contrarian ideas that have a low intrinsic probability of success.” That may be good for innovation – and for venture capitalists, when a bet they’ve made pays off. But it might not always be good for the rest of us. “[SBF’s] luck was almost inevitably going to run out at some point,” he concludes. “But we all got lucky that it ran out as soon as it did.” It’s this level of risk that really brings out Silver’s inner Villager. While he’s pleased the dangers of AI aren’t as “neglected” as they once were, this is still an area where the consequences of Riverian hegemony may be too dire, the case for regulation unarguable. He makes the analogy with other dangerous technologies: “You can’t build a nuclear reactor in your back yard, right? … I think there needs to be a role for government.” Pondering these existential questions may even have led Silver across the Village green and into the (metaphorical) Church. When I ask him if there’s anything people would be surprised to learn about him, he says: “I’m probably leaning more to agnostic than atheist.” He dissolves into giggles as though slightly embarrassed to be talking about it. But then stats man comes rushing back in, lest I think he’s getting a bit woo-woo. “I think, from a kind of Bayesian standpoint, we don’t have good answers to questions about the origins, the nature of the universe. You know, clearly, I think you put a low probability on Christian theology, or something like that, as such. But I think people should be more open‑minded”. “This could be the third book,” he muses. Might Nate Silver end up giving us odds for the existence of God? Don’t bet against it. • On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything by Nate Silver is published by Allen Lane.

                    "bodyText": "A shiver of unease, combined with a strangely defeated shrug, is how the news that entertainment behemoth Lionsgate has signed a deal with the artificial intelligence firm Runway seems to have been greeted by most. The deal gives Runway access to Lionsgate’s substantial back catalogue to develop a new AI model, with the aim of helping film-makers to “augment their work” through the use of AI. Lionsgate’s output includes franchises such as John Wick, Saw and The Hunger Games. So, what exactly will be the end result of this deal? An infinite number of episodes of John Wick on streaming TV in a kind of uncannier-than-uncanny-valley animated series? Four more feature-length iterations of Knives Out, using flesh-and-blood actors but AI-gen scripts? And an AI-gen musical score? And will this result in the increased prohibition of new writers’ work because it is so outside the algorithmically field-tested content? Well, it’s perhaps naive to get too exercised about intellectual property (IP) and proprietary content. Hollywood has always developed projects based on existing literary works, and produced spin-offs on the back of successful TV shows and films. Shakespeare himself often based his plays on existing stories, and developed Falstaff as a recurring character. But wasn’t the conclusion of the recent writers’ strike supposed to have kept AI in its place? It has been considered as a tool to be used by writers (or creators generally) to facilitate their work, and not something that would supplant them entirely. But maybe that was always a little naive. When the new Alien: Romulus movie used AI to bring a character from the original Alien film back from the dead – after discussions with the late actor’s estate – there was outcry at how crass, exploitative and, above all, smug it was. Clearly, however, everyone involved thought that it was a brilliant idea, and expected all lovers of the original film to show a kind of brand loyalty in praising the decision. Some did. Many didn’t. I felt that it was corporate IP/AI at its creepiest. The movie industry is reaching a crisis point of sustainability and authenticity, comparable to the outrage seen in the early 70s among pub customers at the introduction of homogenous gassy, ghastly Double Diamond-type beer, which resulted in the Campaign for Real Ale. Or perhaps a closer comparison is to this country’s sudden spasm of objection to genetically modified food in the 1990s, which resulted in supermarkets taking it off the shelves. Although GM food is now making a comeback because climate change is making it necessary to cultivate hardier types of crop. Now, we are facing a tsunami of genetically modified Double Diamond content sloshing about on screens big and small. There has to be a consumer-led pushback against artificially cultivated proprietary schlock – and critics have to play their part in noticing it and calling it out. Clearly, AI could be a fascinating new generator of creativity and experimentation, but it could also be the complete opposite of those things. ChatGPT-style film-making has, arguably, always been a feature of Hollywood in spirit, but now the technology has caught up. If we are not vigilant, original film-making will become a marginal, connoisseur activity and artificially replicated content will overrun the cinema chains."

                    "bodyText": "We’re wrapping up the blog for today. Here’s what made the news: Former Liberal prime minister John Howard has taken aim at Donald Trump, describing him as “not compatible with democracy”. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie has announced her former upper house colleague Rex Patrick will lead the minor party’s ticket in South Australia in the upcoming federal election. Mortgage holders may have to wait longer for an interest rate reprieve, after stronger than expected jobs figures. The federal government announced a boost to rent assistance. Victoria’s housing crisis has worsened on nearly every key indicator one year since the state government’s housing statement, which set to tackle affordability by building 800,000 new homes and increasing renters’ rights. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has described the Greens as “formidable and destructive” after a week of fighting between the two parties over housing legislation that stalled in the Senate. There is free train travel in Sydney this weekend in a bid to avoid industrial action. The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association said members will strike for 24 hours next week, as pay negotiations continue with the state government. Jewish students are being singled out, spat on, removing identifiable symbols and “fearing for their safety”, a Senate inquiry has heard. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese has arrived in Philadelphia, US, ahead of the Quad leaders meeting. Graham Arnold will depart immediately as head coach of the Socceroos. [Continued from previous post] The Minns government’s legislation was also developed in response to an independent review of the state's environmental laws by former top public servant Dr Ken Henry. While conservation groups are expected to call for the reforms to be even stronger, the inquiry has also heard from developer and industry lobby groups opposed to the reforms. Earlier in today’s hearing, the policy director of the NSW Minerals Council, Claire Doherty, claimed that development wasn’t the biggest contributor to biodiversity loss. She said: Development is a very small proportion of the impacts on nature in NSW. Whether the BOS [Biodiversity Offsets Scheme] is the very highest priority in terms of making changes, I would question that. ‘Loopholes’ need fixing in NSW’s environment laws that allow developers to ‘offset’ habitat clearing, ecological association says The vice-president of the New South Wales Ecological Consultants Association, Rebecca Hogan, says the state government’s proposed biodiversity offset reforms should be amended to fix a range of “loopholes”. A parliamentary inquiry is examining the Minns Labor government’s legislation that would strengthen the state’s environmental laws that allow developers to “offset” habitat clearing. At a hearing this afternoon, Hogan said: We’re in support of most of the reforms proposed, but are deeply concerned by the lack of definition around phrases and terms used. The industry needs clear direction and interpretation guidelines. There are loopholes all over the place. Biodiversity offsetting usually involves conserving and restoring bushland to compensate for clearing of ecosystems in another area for development. The environment minister, Penny Sharpe, promised to reform the system after an earlier inquiry found there was too much flexibility for threatened habitat to be “traded away for cash” when offsets should be a genuine last resort. [Continued in next post] Private companies could be banned from running NSW elections Private companies could be banned from running elections in NSW after reports of three-hour waits to vote at recent council polls, AAP reports. The state’s premier, Chris Minns, floated the ban on Friday, suggesting he would introduce changes that outlawed the practice as long delays could disfranchise voters and potentially threaten democratic principles. Two councils – Liverpool and Fairfield – used private companies at local elections on Saturday, while the NSW Electoral Commission ran the remaining polls. Minns, who claimed the significant delays were only experienced at polling stations run by private contractors, said it “wasn’t good enough”. It has to be as convenient as possible for a voter to walk into a booth, cast their vote, be part of democracy and get on with their Saturday. It’s not acceptable to have a three-hour wait just to cast your vote for a local council election and, I think, a lot of people would have thrown their arms up in frustration and left if they weren’t going to get a fine. But Fairfield council staff disputed the premier’s stance and said voters experienced no delays. Using a private provider was as simple as comparing the options and picking the one with the best value for taxpayers, a spokesperson told AAP. Firefighters battle industrial fire in Sydney’s south-west Fire and Rescue NSW are battling a large fire at a commercial complex on Kaleski Street in Moorebank in Sydney’s south-west. More than 100 firefighters and 26 trucks are either on the scene or en route. Fire and Rescue NSW said: On arrival, crews were confronted with large volumes of smoke coming from the property and immediately set about tackling the blaze with multiple lines of hose. Two aerial platforms are also being used to douse the flames from above. Residents in surrounding buildings have been evacuated and there is a large amount of smoke in the vicinity. Nearby residents are being urged to stay inside, close windows and doors and avoid the area. Operations are ongoing. Victorian drivers spared on-the-spot traffic fines as police beef up industrial action before AFL grand final Victoria’s treasurer has urged police to think about the consequence of their actions as officers beef up industrial action ahead of the AFL grand final, AAP reports. Tim Pallas accused the police union of taking action against the community as a consequence of their own failure to vote for a previous pay offer. He said: I would urge police to think a bit sympathetically about the consequence of the actions. The police association knows full well they reached an agreement in principle with the government, they failed to be able to deliver that agreement through a vote of their membership. It seems a little perverse that they’re taking action against the community and the community’s interest as a consequence of their own failure. Pallas flagged the state would seek Fair Work Commission intervention to reconcile differences in the bargaining. We’re not going to see this as some sort of game in an ongoing negotiation process. The verbal blast followed 15,000 officers voting to escalate efforts for better pay and working hours, including refusing to hand out on-the-spot traffic fines to drivers from Friday morning. Manhunt under way after inmate escapes Sydney’s Silverwater prison An inmate has escaped custody at Sydney’s maximum security Silverwater prison, say NSW police. Gary Glover, 44, was last seen on Jamieson Street, Silverwater, in the city’s south-west, about 1.30pm today. He is described as 170cm tall, Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander in appearance and having a large build, brown eyes, black hair and a tattoo of a flag on the left side of his neck. He was last seen wearing a green shirt and pants, black boots and a yellow hi-visibility vest. Police are appealing for information and urged the public not to approach the man but instead call triple zero (000) immediately. University antisemitism inquiry risks marginalising ‘other communities who face daily discrimination’, new Muslim group says A judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campuses risks marginalising Muslim and Palestinian university students concurrently facing a rise in discrimination, Muslim Voices Matter has warned. A spokesperson for the group Ghaith Krayem told a committee holding a Senate inquiry into the bill that the body fully supported efforts to combat antisemitism “when it genuinely exists”, but questioned the necessity of the legislation. Muslim Votes Matter is one of the new organisations seeking to mobilise Australian Muslims at the next federal election, describing itself as “the largest, and among the fastest growing, minority groups in Australia”. Krayem: What evidence exists to suggest antisemitic incidents at Australian universities are significantly more prevalent or severe than other forms of discrimination such as anti-Muslim or anti-Palestinian racism? We’re not saying it doesn’t exist or it hasn’t increased, we’re asking the community to separate out activism against Israel and its application of Zionism from genuine antisemitism. Kraymen questioned why the bill didn’t concurrently address a parallel rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian sentiments on campuses. He said conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism could have a “chilling effect” on campuses and undermine free speech. By introducing legislation that addresses only one form of racism, we risk further marginalising other communities who face daily discrimination. Meet Coles Jetson: Robotic online grocery shopping has arrived Coles has launched an automated warehouse for grocery delivery in Victoria. The supermarket chain said the Truganina site was more than 87,000 square metres – four times the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground – and, when fully operational, would hold 3m units of stock and be able to process more than 10,000 customer orders a day when running at capacity. Coles said a centralised hub would contain a fleet of more than 700 bots able to fill a customer order containing 50 items in five minutes, using AI air traffic control to guide the bots around a 3D grid. However, Coles staff would pack and deliver the items. A second site in Wetherill Park, New South Wales, will open next month. The Coles chief executive, Leah Weckert, said it was the first of its kind in the country: This transition from a local, store-based fulfillment model to a central, world-class facility will enable us to better serve the greater Melbourne region, home to more than five million people. Amazon has similar facilities and is planning to launch more automated delivery centres in Australia soon. ABS told Labor excluding gender identity questions posed risk to census The Albanese government was warned that excluding questions on sexual orientation and gender identity from the census could increase feelings of exclusion in the LGBTQ+ community and even risk the success of the data collection exercise, newly released documents reveal. The Australian Bureau of Statistics raised concerns in ministerial submissions about strong public criticism to scrapping the proposed questions, potential “damage” to relationships with LGBTQ+ expert groups advising on the census and limitations in the quality of data the census collects.

Overheated market could burn first-time homebuyers, expert says One expert says pushing people to enter the “overheated” housing market is a bad idea, AAP reports, with new data finding first-time buyers want to buy property as soon as possible. A survey from insurance company Helia found 71% of Australians agree “now is a good time” to buy a property, despite cost-of-living stresses and persistent inflation at 3.8%. Of the 3002 respondents, 1965 were first-timers and most (87%) agreed with the statement they were “feeling a growing sense of urgency to buy [their] first property as prices keep going up”. Prof Emma Baker, director of the Australian Centre for Housing Research, warned that focusing on home-buying was not in the nation’s best interest. Should we be encouraging people into an overheated market? No. It’s not fair on them and bringing forward demand in a tight market only contributes to greater unaffordability. She said young householders seeking to become owners “clearly face more barriers than their parents did”. House prices have risen consistently for 50 years, moving from three times to around 10 times average income … Many young people will be lifetime renters. Over the last couple of Censuses, Australia has begun to shift … to a nation of home purchasers and renters. Baker suggested more discussion should focus on how to make rental markets more appealing “rather than obsessing about how to bring more people into home ownership”. Prepare to leave warning issued for rural Queensland town amid fast-moving fire A ‘prepare to leave’ bushfire warning has been issued for Rosenthal Heights, near Warwick, 130km south-west of Brisbane. The Queensland fire department says a fast-moving fire is burning on the corner of Ford and Kingsleigh roads, travelling towards Inverleigh and Ranger roads. Conditions could get worse quickly. Firefighters are working to contain the fire. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. The warning said some properties were at risk and the fire was likely to hit the community in the coming hours. Roads, power, water and mobile phone services may be affected as the fire approaches. Greens warn Danish immigration minister to ‘not go down this path’ on asylum policy Continuing from our last post: Greens immigration spokesperson, David Shoebridge, met Kaare Dybvad Bek and told him, “Very clearly: do not go down this path” and copy the Australian playbook. Shoebridge told AAP: A national asylum policy that deliberately harms innocent people who are only seeking protection is a race to the bottom, where you will squander billions in public funds and degrade your collective values. Australia’s more recent history on asylum seekers should also be a lesson, but in what not to do and how to avoid your politics sinking to a moral low. The Human Rights Watch Australia director, Daniela Gavshon, also told Dybvad Bek that Australia’s “failed offshore detention regime” on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea had caused “immense suffering”. Vibe Klarup, Amnesty International Denmark’s secretary general, likened Nauru to “an open-air prison” and said, “From a human rights perspective, there are no good lessons learned from the very costly Australian model.” Danish immigration minister hails ‘valuable’ Nauru tour Denmark’s immigration minister says he gained “valuable insights” on a trip to Nauru to study Australia’s controversial offshore asylum seeker processing setup, AAP reports. Danish immigration minister, Kaare Dybvad Bek, last week travelled more than 13,000km from Copenhagen to the tiny Pacific Island nation of Nauru, which has hosted an Australian-run immigration detention centre on and off since 2001. He told AAP: I had a prolific trip, which gave me lots of valuable insights and lessons. I learned much about both the pros and the cons of the cooperation between Australia and Nauru. Dybvad Bek said since 2014 more than 30,000 people have drowned or disappeared on their way to Europe, and the “current situation is deeply inhumane and an insult to humanity.” The Danish government only wishes to engage in solutions in line with our international obligations and responsibilities, including the European convention on human rights. We’ll bring you more on this in a moment. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds about the Snowy Mountains from tomorrow morning. Damaging winds around 60-70km/h, with peak gusts above 90km/h, are possible over elevations above 1000m of parts of the Snowy Mountains from early tomorrow. This will follow the passage of a cold front across Victoria. Winds are expected to ease by early Saturday afternoon, the Bureau said. Locations which may be affected include Jindabyne, Perisher Valley, Charlotte Pass, Thredbo and Adaminaby. Union asked if rejecting 3% offer would give it less leverage in negotiations Over four months of negotiations, Shaye Candish said the union wasn’t able to resolve “even the most simple claims” such as whether nurses should be entitled to have two days off in a row. However, two small no-cost claims have been settled, in relation to having notice boards in tea rooms and nurses not working night shifts before they go on leave. In response to a question suggesting that rejecting the 3% offer would give the union less leverage in negotiations, Caddish said “we would never stand in the way of our members receiving an increase to their pay”. But the reality for us is that members have already rejected this offer, and 3% doesn’t go nearly far enough. Low wages were undermining their ability to deliver high quality care, Shaye Candish added, and leaving nurses and midwives feeling undervalued. NSW midwives are moving to states like Victoria and Queensland, where wages are between 10 and 22% higher, she said. Unfortunately they’re in a position where they’re forced to take this action to the government to the table and offer something meaningful. It’s not acceptable for the state government to continue turning a blind eye to the pay inequity that is seriously undermining this state’s largest female-dominated workforce. We now have the lowest paid nurses and midwives in the country. NSW nurses and midwives will strike for 24 hours next Tuesday, after the government has given “no indication they intend to move” on their initial offer of an annual pay rise of 3%. NSW health minister, Ryan Park, this morning said the 3% pay rise was conditional on no further industrial action. NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) general secretary, Shaye Candish, said the government’s offer of a 3% increase was “already rejected” by NSWNMA members, who have called for a wage increase of 15%. The union has “genuinely tried to avert this action, but the government has simply failed to demonstrate a willingness to move”, she said. Our members are furious … it’s a really difficult decision for a nurse or midwife to decide to go on strike. Nuclear cannot deliver in timeframe needed for climate and energy security, independent MP says Independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, says that nuclear power cannot deliver results in the timeframe needed for “climate and for energy security”. In a series of tweets, she responded to reports that the Coalition’s plan for seven nuclear power plants could lift power bills for average households by $665 a year: Spender said: The next 10 years is what counts for climate and for energy security, and nuclear simply cannot deliver in that timeframe. This is not about being “pro” or “anti” particular technologies. It’s about basing energy policy on the facts. We’re already at ~40% renewables. We need to accelerate action on what we know works, rather than causing huge investment uncertainty by ripping up AEMO’s plan. We can remain open to the possibility that new technologies may develop on future, but that doesn’t mean we should bet the house on them and ignore the evidence of what works today. Taking questions, James Johnson said the Socceroos have a match in less than three weeks – which is why they’re looking to appoint a new, permanent coach, rather than an interim one. We will look locally and globally. But ultimately, we need a coach that will come in and get the best out of an Australian group of players and take our great players through a complicated Asian qualifying process. FA hopes to appoint new Socceroos coach ‘in the coming days’ James Johnson said Football Australia was already searching for a new coach: We know the market, we know who is available, and I want to confirm that we will move quickly to appoint a permanent coach before the next window. And hopefully, in the coming days or next week or two, we would like to convene you here with us so we can share the news of who the new Socceroos coach will be. James Johnson from Football Australia has been speaking to reporters, following news that Socceroos head coach Graham Arnold has resigned. Johnson said the resignation transpired “very quickly”, off the back of the last match in the qualifiers against Indonesia. I want to say very clearly that we appreciate Graham Arnold… [He] has been a key person within the Subway Socceroos set-up for the past six years, and under his leadership, there have been many outstanding achievements that have been made by the Subway Socceroos… He’s had an outstanding playing career and he’s done a lot for Australian football. So we wish Graham Arnold, we wish his family, all the very best in the future and on behalf of the Football Australia board, I do want to thank Graham, personally, for all of the work that he’s done over the past six years. Aussie shares hit all-time high for fourth straight day The local share market has hit a record high for a fourth straight session and is on track for its seventh straight day of gains, AAP reports. At noon the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 36.4 points, or 0.44%, to 8,228.3, and had been as high as 8,246.2. For the week it was on track for a 1.5% gain, its best week in five weeks. The broader All Ordinaries was up 41 points, or 0.49%, to 8,458.0. Every sector of the ASX was higher at midday, with tech the biggest gainer, up 1.2% as Technology One grew 2.2% to an all-time high of $24.02 and Life360 rose 5.4% to a 10-day high of $18.13. In the heavyweight mining sector, goldminers were gaining as the precious metal changed hands just below its all-time high of $2,600 set Wednesday. Northern Star was up 1.0%, Evolution had added 0.9% and West African Resources had grown 2.7%. Elsewhere in the sector, BHP and Fortescue were both up 0.6%, while Rio Tinto had edged 0.1% higher. The big four banks were mixed, with ANZ up 0.7% and Westpac adding 0.2%, while CBA and NAB were both down 0.1%. Insurance companies IAG and Suncorp had dropped 0.6 and 1.4%, respectively, while Computershare had dropped 2.8%. Lower interest rates tend to hurt the bottom lines of all three companies, which need to have billions stashed in short-term investments. Myer was down 5.1% to a nine-day low of 83c after the department store chain reported a 26% drop in full-year profit. University of Sydney ‘did not always meet expectations of Jewish community’: vice-chancellor The vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Prof Mark Scott, has apologised to students and staff who provided testimonies of antisemitism on his campus, acknowledging his institution “did not always meet the expectations of the Jewish community”. Speaking at a Senate inquiry into antisemitism, where the Committee heard the University of Sydney was one of the “worst places” to be a Jewish student, he said he had “never encountered an issue that’s generated more anguish or grief or anger” as the events of, and after, 7 October: I’ve read the complaints that have been made to the university and all those shared in submissions to this inquiry … and the testimonials are heartbreaking and unacceptable and for that I am sorry. No one should feel at risk, unsafe or unwelcome at any place of learning. Scott said the establishment of a pro-Palestine encampment at his university in March – the first in Australia – presented a “difficult period for the university, its students and staff”. He said management was meeting daily in a “complex, fast moving environment” to navigate campus safety. I recognise we did not always meet the expectations of the Jewish community. I regret we did not communicate the agreement to end the encampment with the Jewish community before it was announced. I realise there is a lot of work to do to win back the trust and confidence of the university’s Jewish community and I’m committed to doing that. It’s a Friday afternoon, which can only mean one thing: it’s time to get stuck into the latest Weekly Beast from Amanda Meade: The Bureau of Meteorology has published a weather outlook for the weekend ahead, with rain set to affect the north-west: Australia needs ‘strong, decisive’ response to deaths in custody: Senator Thorpe Yesterday, independent senator Lidia Thorpe’s motion for the attorney general to provide quarterly reports on deaths in custody passed the Senate. It passed with the support of all non-government senators. The quarterly statements will detail, by state and territory, the number of: Deaths in custody, including breakdown by age groups and cause of death Ongoing coronial inquests; Incidents of self-harm in custodial settings; and Miscarriages and stillbirths in custodial settings. In a statement today, Thorpe said Australia needs “a strong, decisive federal response and nation leadership on these critical issues”. Yesterday Labor senators were alone in opposing this motion. The entire crossbench and the Coalition are united on this. We want to see the federal government finally start taking responsibility for what is happening in this country’s criminal legal system. Labor will make the excuse that these are just ‘state issues’, but we should not accept this weak cop-out. The attorney-general meets regularly with the states and territories, he can and should require them to provide this data. Lifeline (13 11 14), 13YARN (13 92 76) Further Cook Strait ferry drama in New Zealand A ferry containing 88 passengers and crew lost power and drifted for two hours in New Zealand’s notoriously dangerous Cook Strait, AAP reports. In the latest drama to hit ferry sailings between the North and South islands, the Connemara was tugged back to Wellington early on Friday morning after the mishap. Wellington harbourmaster Grant Nalder told Radio NZ the ferry, run by private operators Bluebridge, lost power about 10.30pm as it was sailing off the south coast of Wellington, bound for Picton. The incident occurred in thankfully light winds, and the Connemara was drifting south-east, away from land. The NZ transport minister, Simeon Brown, called the power outage an “unfortunate incident” that would prompt the Connemara’s grounding, and told Radio NZ: The vessel won’t be allowed to go back into service until [Maritime New Zealand] has investigated and is assured that it is safe for it to do so. Bluebridge said 24 passengers, 13 freight drivers and crew were on board the overnight freight sailing, which returned to its Wellington wharf at sunrise. Two Melbourne women who were planning to run for the now-abolished seat of Higgins on a job-sharing basis now say they will run for a Senate spot. Lucy Bradlow, a political communications expert, and Bronwen Bock, an investment banker, announced in April they planned to run for federal parliament as independent “job-sharing candidates” for the Melbourne metropolitan seat. If they were successful, they planned to share a laptop, as well as split official duties and travel to Canberra on alternate weeks. The Australian Electoral Commission has since abolished Higgins in its redistribution prior to the next federal election. And the pair said in a Facebook post on Friday they now plan to run for the Senate – as a single senator: Higgins no longer exists, but our belief remains. We believe Australians deserve real representation, real action, and a government that works for its constituents. That’s why today, we are launching the Better Together Party – our campaign to be the independent job-sharing Senator for Victoria. We want to give Victorians a real voice in the federal Senate. We stand for a new era of politics, where collaboration and inclusivity drive innovative policies and meaningful change for all Australians. But we can’t do it alone. We need you to join us on our journey. If you’re registered to vote ANYWHERE in Australia, you can be part of the Better Together Party and have a voice in our future. It’s easy and free to sign up. Visit our website TODAY to join us and learn more about our policies and values. Consumer advocate says insurance sector faces ‘market failure’ A consumer advocacy group has told a parliamentary inquiry the insurance sector has suffered a “market failure”, with fast-rising home premiums leaving families exposed. Tyrone Shandiman, founder of the Australian Consumers Insurance Lobby, cited the example of a pensioner in Townsville, in Queensland’s north, paying 40% of her pension for home insurance. Shandiman said: We believe in the first instance insurers should have the opportunity to deal with problems within this market, but we do not support market failure, and the market is failing. We believe that when the insurance market is not meeting the needs for consumers, governments must intervene. Australia is grappling with an insurance crisis, leaving many households either unwilling or unable to insure their homes, with those in and around areas prone to natural disasters the most affected. Shandiman said that high premiums were forcing people to under-insure or drop insurance altogether, which meant they required government assistance when things went wrong. The Greens-chaired select committee on the impact of climate risk on insurance is holding a public hearing in Sydney today. Sydney rail chaos averted as free fares get union tick Earlier, we brought you news that Sydney’s business community was pleading with rail workers to call off industrial action, ahead of meetings to confirm free-travel arrangements for this weekend’s footy finals. You can read all the details earlier in the blog here. As AAP now reports, Unions NSW assistant secretary and lead negotiator, Thomas Costa, said trains could run as needed while the free-travel offer was in place. He told ABC Radio: If you’re offering free fares over the weekend, we’re happy to run the trains as normal. Whether the trains run as normal or not will be up for management and their ability to manage the timetables. The rail union’s opposition to the conversion of a stretch of the Bankstown line to metro train is running in parallel to an enterprise agreement claim for a 32% pay rise over four years and a 35-hour work week. Transport for NSW secretary, Josh Murray, said there would still be interruptions over the weekend as officials worked through last-minute schedule changes: We’re putting those special event services into the timetable and we’ll provide more information about what the regularity of those will be because it’s last minute. The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association says members will strike for 24 hours next week, as pay negotiations continue with the state government. Thousands of nurses and midwives will strike from the start of morning shift next Tuesday. The union says the Minns government failed to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate in good faith by close of business yesterday. Earlier this morning, NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said the government accepted to pay nurses an interim 3% increase, back-paid to 1 July this year, contingent on the industrial action ceasing. NSWNMA general secretary, Shaye Candish, said in a statement: We have genuinely tried to avert this action, but the government has simply failed to demonstrate a willingness to move. Our members are desperate to provide the safe level of care NSW patients need when seeking treatment inside public hospitals, but instead of their skilled work being remunerated accordingly, their employer believes a baseline 3% pay offer is enough. It’s not acceptable for the state government to continue turning a blind eye to the pay inequity that is seriously undermining this state’s largest female-dominated workforce. We now have the lowest paid nurses and midwives in the country. Jewish council calls for inquiry into all kinds of racism on university campuses A judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campuses risks silencing Palestinian voices and stoking a culture war, the Jewish Council of Australia has warned. Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia and an academic at the University of Melbourne, has told a Senate inquiry into the proposed bill that it risked increasing antisemitism by conflating Judaism with the state of Israel. We have never been more visible. Our identities and communities are constantly platformed, written about in the media and weaponised by politicians to justify support for a nation state accused of genocide. Such an inquiry risks pitting racialised groups against each other. An inquiry into antisemitism alone places it in a category separate to other forms of racism, thus creating a perception of a hierarchy of racism which we say will only generate division between Jewish and other racialised groups. Instead, she said the body would support an inquiry into all kinds of racism on university campuses – including Islamophobia and racism towards Indigenous Australians, as was recommended in the Australian Universities Accord. The Senate inquiry into the proposed bill has received more than 600 submissions, including from students who have expressed fear of attending campus due to rising antisemitism. However others, including the Loud Jew Collective, warned the proposed commission of inquiry was being proposed “not to combat antisemitism but rather to exceptionalise Jews and to demonise Palestinians and their supporters”. NT teachers to be highest paid in country under new deal, education minister says The NT’s education minister, Jo Hersey, says teachers in the territory will become the highest paid in Australia under a new pay deal. In a statement, she said more than 90% of teachers voted in support of the Territory government’s pay offer of a 12.9% pay increase over three years. The Territory must be competitive if we are going to attract and retain excellent teachers and this deal delivers the country’s best pay deal. Other benefits include a $1,000 increase in the Katherine and Alice Springs attraction and retention allowance, she said, which is now worth $4,500 a year. Over the life of the agreement, the increase represents a 13.46% compounded pay rise. The commissioner for public employment will lodge the agreement with the Fair Work Commission for approval, and until then, the current enterprise agreement continues to apply. Man in critical condition after alleged shooting in rural NSW An investigation is under way after a 46-year-old man was shot in the abdomen at a rural property in New South Wales. Officers were called to the Hillston property, 100km north-west of Griffith, about 2.30am and were told the man and two women – 31 and 56 – were in the home when three people allegedly entered, one armed with a firearm. Police allege the resident was shot twice before the alleged intruders left. The man was treated by paramedics and taken to Griffith hospital, and has since been airlifted to a major metropolitan hospital in a critical condition with life-threatening injuries. Inquiries are now under way, police said. Football Australia has released a statement, confirming Graham Arnold will depart immediately as head coach of the Socceroos. FA said Arnold advised them of his decision to resign earlier this week. Arnold has served as the head coach since August 2018, marking his second term with the team after a brief interim role in 2006-2007. James Johnson, CEO of Football Australia, said: While we respect his decision and are saddened to see Graham leave the national team set-up, this scenario is not uncommon in international football. We will act swiftly in appointing a new head coach to ensure continuity and stability, particularly as we approach the crucial second window of the AFC Asian Qualifiers next month. Arnold said that “leading the Subway Socceroos has been the pinnacle of my career and a true honour”. I’ve given 40 years of service to Australian football, with the last six years in my role as Socceroos’ head coach. I said after our game against Indonesia that I had some decisions to make, and after deep reflection, my gut has told me it’s time for change, both for myself and the program. Sydney academics concerned policy requiring permission for megaphones and posters on campus may be illegal More than 50 academics at the University of Sydney’s Law School have signed an open letter expressing concerns a new campus policy which requires explicit permission for megaphones to be used or posters to be put up on campus may be illegal. The letter, delivered to the chancellor, vice-chancellor and Senate on Friday, said the policy “unreasonably limits” the right to free protest on campus and was introduced without consultation, breaching the university’s own policies and inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under international law. The policy breaks with a proud history and tradition of protest at the University of Sydney. It disproportionately curtails the freedoms of expression, assembly and movement that have long been enjoyed responsibly by the staff, students and the general public at the university. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney said it always welcomed feedback and appreciated the “time and consideration” colleagues had taken to share their views about its new policy, adding they planned to review it before the end of the year, with formal submissions encouraged. We updated the policy to ensure we are striking the appropriate balance between protecting freedom of speech and academic freedom, while making sure our campuses are safe and welcoming for all our students and staff, and our core operations can take place without disruption. It comes as the university is under fire on Friday at a Senate inquiry on antisemitism on campus. The Zionist Federation of Australia president, Jeremy Leibler, told the inquiry the vice-chancellor’s engagement with Jewish and Israeli students was “extremely sub-standard”. That provided anti-Israel protesters with a powerful lesson and a disturbing lesson. The PM was asked why he doesn’t go to New York for the UN next week, which he hasn’t attended since taking office? Anthony Albanese said he was coming to the US just for the Quad and had “been to the overseas meetings that I have to go to.” He listed upcoming meetings he would be attending, including the G20, Chogm – and hosting King Charles and Queen Camilla during their visit – plus the Asean and East Asia summit in Laos. I have prioritised the visits that I have to make and I know I get criticised for not doing more international travel. The irony of that, when compared with some of the coverage of when I do travel, is not lost. Asked if he didn’t view the UN as important, he said “of course it is, but Penny Wong, our foreign minister, will be attending.” Also asked if he would be meeting with Donald Trump, Albanese said “I am meeting the president of the United States. It is Joe Biden and I will meet with him.” Anthony Albanese was asked if he had the chance to speak with Narendra Modi since the announcement Australia expelled two Indian spies in 2020. The PM was asked, what will you be saying to him to get an ally, a friend, to cease and desist from that kind of spying on Australian soil? He responded: What I do is act diplomatically and have those discussions, and that will no doubt be something that is raised… I spoke with prime minister Modi a couple of weeks ago in August … after his re-election and congratulated him… I raise issues privately [which is] how we deal with things diplomatically, and I’ll continue to do so. PM responds to release of footage showing interaction between Chinese and Australian aircrafts in 2022 The White House has said China would be high on the agenda during Quad discussions. The PM was asked if he agrees with this, and if the release of footage showing an interaction between a Chinese aircraft and an Australian aircraft was “perhaps some sort of preemptive warning to Australia about Chinese strength?” Anthony Albanese responded: We know that in our region there is strategic competition, and of course that is a factor when we look at the way that our region is operating, the relations between the rise of China with nations in our region. But that is not the only focus of course. This is a focus on our four nations, the security and stability that democracies can provide and we want to, with regard to China, my position is very clear. It is that we will cooperate when we can, we will disagree where we must, but we will engage in our national interest. And that is something that has led to an improvement in the relationships with China, and that does not mean there aren’t differences there, there are. We talk about them and we discuss them in appropriate forms and we discuss them very directly. Anthony Albanese was asked if he is concerned Donald Trump would walk away from the Quad alliance, if elected in November. The PM said he was not concerned, because “this is a relationship between our two great nations forged during World War II”. Ever since then, we have relied upon our friends in the United States and they have been able to rely upon us as well. Anthony Albanese has arrived in Philadelphia, US, ahead of the Quad leaders meeting, and has been speaking to reporters. The prime minister said the Quad meeting provides “an opportunity to talk directly to the leaders of the United States in president [Joe] Biden, my friend prime minister [Narendra] Modi from India and my friend the prime minister [Fumio Kishida] of Japan.” We will be discussing ways in which we can provide further support in the region, to developing nations, including the action that we are taking together on climate change and supporting their energy security… As I said in my Shangri-La dialogue address last year in Singapore, peace and security do not just happen, you have to work on it. You’ve got to work for stability and that is what the Quad focus will be over the next couple of days. Qantas says teams working to get footy fans to Sydney for the game Qantas has just issued a statement following this morning’s cancelled flight from Adelaide to Sydney. A spokesperson said: We understand this disruption is frustrating and apologise to passengers the inconvenience. Our teams have worked hard to get footy fans on their way as soon as possible and all customers impacted are due to arrive into Sydney in time for the game. It’s understood the QF734 flight was cancelled due to an engineering issue, and customers have been reaccommodated onto the earliest possible services – with the latest customers arriving to Sydney by 6.45pm. More on the flights from Adelaide to Sydney, ahead of tonight’s game: A search of the next flights available with Qantas shows customers may have to spend thousands to get a seat on board, after the 10am flight was cancelled. An 11.25am flight from Adelaide to Sydney, via Canberra, was listed from $2,207 about 10.50am. Meanwhile a midday flight from Adelaide to Melbourne, then Melbourne to Sydney via Jetstar, was listed for $1,329. Adelaide-Sydney flight cancelled ahead of tonight’s AFL A Qantas flight from Adelaide to Sydney has been cancelled at the last minute, ahead of Port Adelaide’s preliminary final against the Swans at the SCG. Flight QF734 from Adelaide to Sydney, set to depart at 10am, has been cancelled. Some people reportedly paid over $900 for a seat on board. Another Qantas flight from Adelaide to Sydney is scheduled for 11am, while a Virgin flight is scheduled for 11.25am and a Jetstar flight at midday. An Adelaide Airport spokesperson said it is unsure of the reason for the cancellation and had contacted Qantas for more information. We have also reached out to Qantas for comment, and will bring you the latest when we can. As we flagged just earlier, a commemorative service has been taking place in Canberra to mark 25 years since Australian troops were first deployed to Timor-Leste. Some photos have begun filtering through from the service: Graham Arnold is to step down as Socceroos manager before Australia’s next World Cup qualifier in October, AAP reports. Sources familiar with negotiations told AAP that Arnold has been in dialogue with Football Australia this week, ironing out an exit strategy from a role he has held since 2018. Arnold’s departure comes after the Socceroos picked up just one point from a possible six in their opening two games of third round World Cup qualifying. Australia fell to Bahrain earlier this month and then were held scoreless in a 0-0 draw with Indonesia. FA declined to comment when contacted by AAP. Today marks 25 years since Australian troops were first deployed to Timor-Leste. Around 5,500 Australian service personnel were sent in 1999, the largest deployment of Australian troops since the Vietnam War, after the Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia in 1999. The minister for defence personnel, Matt Keogh, said in a statement: We pay tribute to the six Australians who tragically lost their lives while deployed, or as a result of their service. We also recognise the remarkable resilience of the Timorese people and the enduring friendship between our two nations. We are grateful to the many Australians who served in Timor-Leste who have regularly returned over these 25 years, strengthening the bonds and productivity of local communities. As commemorative services are held all over Australia, we thank all who served and continue to serve to this day. A commemorative service has been taking place at the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra, where Keogh is delivering an address. We’ll bring you more from this, and photos from the service, as they filter through. Advocates fear government’s support at home provisions based on misleading data Advocates for older people have expressed fears that the federal government’s support at home provisions in its new aged care bill are based on misleading data, in the wake of a report today from Anglicare. Anglicare Australia surveyed home and community care providers servicing 28,000 older people. All those providers reported being unable to meet the demand for at-home services under the commonwealth home support programme within their community. Describing the current funding model as “restrictive and rationed”, the report also noted, as Guardian Australia has previously reported, that the government’s published wait times for the more substantial home care packages do not include the time it takes for a person to be assessed or reassessed. Current wait times exceed 15 months for some packages. You can read more about the way the home care funding model currently works and why older people and their advocates have been pushing so hard for the new model here: In announcing the new aged care act last week, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the new model would reduce wait times for in-home care, with a target of a three-month wait by July 2027. Corey Irlam, acting chief executive of older person’s advocacy organisation Cota, said that benchmark needed to include all aspects of the waiting process, including the wait for assessment. We’re not talking about a difference of a week here and there – we’re talking about many, many months of an older person’s life. With reports of around 10,000 people dying a year on the waitlist, sadly that’s often time people don’t have. Not only will we be pushing the government to ensure it’s not fudging the figures on how long people are actually waiting for care, but we’ll also be calling on the Parliament to ensure the new Aged Care Act has a legal requirement for Government to publish a full waitlist report making the entire waiting journey transparent from application until your aged care services commence. Department store chain Myer has suffered a steep fall in full-year profit, with the result weighed down by weak sales in underperforming brands Sass &amp; Bide, Marcs and David Lawrence. Myer posted a $52.6m net profit result for 2023-24, according to results released today, down 26% from a year earlier. Sales also fell, dragged lower by store closures. The company attributed the fall in profit to challenging trading conditions, inflationary cost pressures and underperformance of various fashion labels. Myer’s executive chair, Olivia Wirth, said: Today’s result reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment for Australian retailers. The recent earnings season showed that consumers were reducing their spending on many discretionary items, with furniture and clothing retailers among the most affected. Myer disclosed that about half of its decline in net profit was attributable to the underperformance of brands Sass &amp; Bide, Marcs and David Lawrence. The NSW government says it will accept a recommendation put forward by the Industrial Relations Commission as pay negotiations continue with the Nurses and Midwives’ Association. Nurses and midwives walked off the job across the state for 12 hours earlier this month, after demands for a 15% pay rise this year were rebuffed. In a statement this morning, NSW health minister Ryan Park said the IRC had recommended both parties enter four weeks of intensive discussions. The IRC recommends NSW Health pay nurses an interim 3% increase, back-paid to 1 July this year, contingent on the industrial action ceasing. Park said: The Government will accept this, and has notified the Association of its intention to do so, on the basis the Association also agrees to the recommendation. Park said this is “an opportunity for nurses to receive increased pay and patients to continue to receive care while the broader dispute is in the process of being resolved by the parties.” Lithium-ion batteries ‘fastest growing fire risk’ in NSW, says Fire and Rescue Fire and Rescue NSW says that lithium-ion batteries are the “fastest growing fire risk” in the state. Since 1 January this year, FRNSW says it has attended more than 210 lithium-ion battery fires where people were injured and property severely damaged, with two fatalities. This comes as the firefighting agency says it recorded 12 preventable residential fire deaths across NSW this winter – an increase of four on last year’s fatality rate. There were 1,001 residential fires and 105 people injured this winter according to FRNSW, who released the following data: In 422 cases, fires broke out in kitchens, 95 in the bedroom, 79 in lounge rooms and 51 in chimneys. The leading cause of residential fires was human activity (494) followed by arson (138), undetermined causes (123), electrical faults (77) and overheating (40). FRNSW commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell said the statistics reinforce the importance of having a working smoke alarm: In almost half of all fires we attend each winter, there is no smoke alarm or it is not in working order. These figures are very sobering and should be a wake-up call for people to take home fire safety seriously. Senior constable charged with allegedly supplying prohibited drugs A police officer has been charged with allegedly supplying prohibited drugs in southern New South Wales, police said in a statement. Following extensive inquiries, a search warrant was executed at a home in Wagga Wagga yesterday where a number of items were seized for forensic examination. A 36-year-old male senior constable – attached to a command within the southern region – was arrested and taken to Wagga Wagga police station. He was charged with three counts of supplying prohibited drugs and knowingly dealing in proceeds of crime. The man was granted conditional bail to appear before Wagga Wagga local court on 13 November. The man is suspended with pay and his employment status is under review. Jewish students are being singled out, spat on, removing identifiable symbols and “fearing for their safety”, a Senate inquiry has heard. President of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students (AUJS), Noah Loven, told the inquiry into antisemitism on campuses that the current situation was “untenable”. We are in a crisis and this crisis has gone on for far too long. Some have stepped up but others have allowed this hate to fester … letting Jewish students fend for themselves. Loven said not all criticism of Israel was antisemitic but “some undeniably crosses the line”. We fully support the right to protest but when protests glorify violence against Jews, insult or harass them, deface campuses with swastikas, it crosses a line. Assoc Prof Efrat Eilam, from the Australian Academic Alliance against Antisemitism, said staff and students were being subjugated to a “Jewish cancel culture”. The two bodies have backed a judicial inquiry, with the AUJS noting the situation had become “politicised” and a unified response was necessary to draw a line. The inquiry has received more than 600 submissions, with some Jewish community members citing antisemitism and others noting heightened levels of Islamophobia and expressing concern over conflation with antisemitism and criticism of Israel. The University of Sydney is one of the “worst places” to be a Jewish student, a Senate inquiry has heard. Asked about management’s response to an ongoing pro-Palestine encampment, national vice-president of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, Zachary Morris, said the university was “one of the worst places” to be a Jewish student, adding the vice-chancellor had “failed his students”. We have tried repeatedly to engage, after the first meeting his chief of staff had to apologise for his behaviour as soon as he left the office … The issue is no longer with what is happening with students, the issue is with how the administration has responded. If it was just about flags we wouldn’t be here … there’s a marked reduction in attendance. Morris cited graffiti of swastikas in a tunnel left for two weeks, students being filmed and receiving death threats and academics “terrified to leave their offices”. In June, the university instructed protestors to disband their encampment, and have since enacted a strict Campus Access Policy requiring additional approval for some protests. Jewish groups and vice-chancellors will be among those to appear at the Senate inquiry today into shadow education minister Sarah Henderson’s private senator’s bill to establish a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campuses. Henderson said there had been a “failure of leadership” from vice-chancellors who had allowed “hate and incitement to run rampant over many months”. Here’s a look at today’s weather forecasts across the country, thanks to the Bureau of Meteorology: Portable wi-fi stations to support disaster-hit communities in NSW The NSW government is rolling out portable tech to deliver back-up internet connectivity during natural disasters, AAP reports, so communities and emergency responders can stay connected. The technology includes trailer-mounted, solar-powered satellite internet stations that can provide wi-fi coverage to a roughly 500 metre radius. There are four portable connectivity units on the way that can be combined to cover a larger area. The units will also be available in Service NSW disaster recovery centres, alongside a satellite-equipped vehicle so the agency can set up temporary offices with internet access. The supplied connectivity will also be handy for contacting family members, applying for government support and lodging insurance claims after disaster events. The government is investing about $5m in the new technology, which will be delivered this summer. Rishworth questioned on calls for total ban on gambling advertising Moving to calls for a total ban on gambling advertising, Amanda Rishworth was asked why the government won’t accept this recommendation. She said the government has “introduced bet stop [and] activity statements”, so are “looking at the evidence of what actually makes a difference”. Now, when it comes to the late Peta Murphy’s report, we’re of course working through those recommendations. 21 of those recommendations have really significant interactions or require co-governance with states and territories, and I’m working with my state and territory colleagues about how we progress many of these recommendations. So, this is a joint effort. But to suggest we haven’t been doing anything is just not right. We have taken the most significant action. What about comments from health experts that banning gambling ads would go further to tackle the scourge of problem gambling and help families? Rishworth said “we’re looking at that recommendation very closely” and repeated that she was working with state and territory colleagues. Asked when a decision on this is expected, she repeated a similar answer: We’re working through all the issues. I continue to talk with my state and territory colleagues, and we’ll keep working on this. Rishworth defends jobseeker increase Asked if the government should do more to increase JobSeeker – going up roughly a dollar to $56 a day, still well below the Henderson poverty line – Amanda Rishworth said: In terms of those on the lowest incomes, we’re very focused on supporting those people. Many people on JobSeeker will also get Commonwealth rent assistance. They will also benefit from our freeze to medicines, will benefit two years in a row from our $300 discount on energy bills. So, these are a suite of measures. We’ll always look at where we can better support people. Part of that is making sure that we do every budget look at what we can budget for. At the same time as making sure we’re not adding to the inflation challenge. That’s the balance we’re doing. Amanda Rishworth questioned on increase to rent assistance The minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, was also on ABC News Breakfast to discuss the increase to jobseeker and rent assistance from today. She was asked about those comments from Dr Cassandra Goldie (see earlier posts) that while extra money is welcome for people receiving government payments, rent increases for a single person is only $1.64 a day. Is that enough? Rishworth responded: Obviously it’s a 12% increase in the support of rent assistance on those maximum rates. But since we’ve had come to government, people have had $2,000 on average extra in rent assistance for those receiving commonwealth rent assistance. The minister said this “helped to drive down rents across the board” and is “not the only measure”. Sydney’s business community is pleading with rail workers to call off industrial action ahead of meetings to confirm travel arrangements for this weekend’s footy finals, AAP reports. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union failed to reach a breakthrough in emergency talks with the NSW government and threatened to not provide the extra services needed for a marquee weekend of sport. In Sydney there are NRL and AFL finals – including the Swans’ sold-out game against Port Adelaide at the SCG – and the Bledisloe Cup rugby union fixture. The state’s transport minister Jo Haylen says trains will be free on the weekend, a concession to the union hoped to allow for timetable changes so special event services can run. She told ABC Radio today: One of the bans that the union has put in place is around altering the timetable, so that means no ability for Sydney Trains to run those special event services. [The union and Sydney Trains] are meeting now and we’re hopeful that given we have opened the gates … that we will be able to insert those special event services to get people out to Sydney Olympic Park. Acoss wants jobseeker lifted to same rate as pension Q: I know you’ve been pressuring the government on the jobseeker front for many years now. What ideally would you like to see the figure increased to, per week? Acoss CEO Dr Cassandra Goldie said: We have consistently said that payment needs to go up to the same rate as the pension, so it would go from $56 per day now to $82 per day. This is a modest increase. It was recommended that we get a substantial increase to jobseeker … repeatedly by the independent Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee which was created by the Labor government. Very generous tax cuts were delivered for people on higher incomes, and here we are today with again a couple of dollars extra for people who are on the pension and jobseeker – just $1 extra per day to cover very serious increases in costs. The chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, Dr Cassandra Goldie, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier as the government’s promised 10% increase to commonwealth rent assistance begins today. Goldie said that jobseeker payments will go from $55 per day to $56 per day, and for single pensioners it will go from $80 per day to $82 per day. The commonwealth rent assistance would go from $94 per week to $105 per week, she added. I think people can see that every dollar does make a difference, but these are not big dollars – and these are coming off the back of poverty payments already. Jobseeker is nowhere near what it needs to be as the unemployment payment to help people out there trying to cover those big rent increases, those ongoing increases in food prices and of course, medicines and other essentials. Shorten skirts question on whether Donald Trump is compatible with democracy As the wide-ranging interview wrapped up, Bill Shorten was also asked about comments from former PM John Howard that Donald Trump is “not compatible with democracy”. Shorten said Howard is “entitled his opinion” but the comments were “a pretty interesting development [and] I think his party should listen carefully to what he says”. Asked if Trump is incompatible with democracy, as Howard suggested, Shorten said he currently serves in the government who “will work with whoever America produces [via] their electoral processes”. But what does Shorten, the soon-to-be vice-chancellor, think? He said: Get back to me on the first of February … or sometime in February on that one. But I do think that the January 6 riots were shocking. I do think it’s a matter of record that more could have been done by the outgoing president. But you know, John Howard has got the freedom of not being in politics, and I have the privilege of serving in a cabinet. Shorten questioned on role of group homes moving forward with NDIS Moving to the NDIS, Bill Shorten was asked how the government is progressing with recommendations to phase out segregated employment by 2034 and group homes within 15 years – which the government said needed further consideration. He responded: I think we’re capable of providing independence, innovation and the accommodation options for people with profound and severe disabilities, which will ultimately make the need for sort of group homes … not so necessary. But it’s going to take a lot of work to get that right. See, a lot of the housing we use is sort of what you call was the legacy housing – the states might have built it in the 50s and 60s, and they passed that over to the NDIS accommodation. Sometimes we’re fitting people around old houses rather than working out what new tech could mean for innovation, independence for people. It is a complex task, and it’s going to be a multiple election cycle task, but we are now as a nation investing the money in it, which wasn’t always the case. Asked about UN vote, Shorten says ‘mainstream Australia’ wants comprehensive ceasefire deal Bill Shorten was also asked to respond to comments from opposition leader Peter Dutton, that the government is damaging its relationship with the US and Israel, after Australia decided to abstain from a UN motion calling for a withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank. At the same time, deputy leader of the Greens Mehreen Faruqi said Labor had “shown itself to be gutless fence-sitters” and voters would “not forgive and forget”. Shorten said Dutton’s “job is to just oppose things that the government are doing” and defended the government’s position: The fact that we’re pressing for a ceasefire, that we want increased humanitarian access – so we want the release of hostages, which we’ve been very consistent on and that we want to prevent regional escalation – is the right way to go. In opposition [it’s] easy just to throw rocks, but when you’re in government you’ve got to take into account all the perspectives and the long-term interests. And I think that the fact we’re supporting a comprehensive ceasefire deal is actually where mainstream Australia is. Q: The Fed has cut rates by half a percentage point. Should the RBA be looking to do the same? Bill Shorten says “the Fed is different to the RBA” and while the RBA is independent “that doesn’t mean that they’re immune to getting advice from other people or hearing different points of view”. I think it is significant that the Fed has decided to lower interest rates in America by half a per cent, but our economies are not identical. So how long that takes to flow through and the impact that has remains to be seen. I noticed that our dollar rallied on the basis that the Fed was cutting rates and of course, with a rallying dollar, it means … it takes some pressure, inflationary pressure [off] us. Bill Shorten was asked if the Greens had outperformed the government, at least in the messaging on housing. He told host Patricia Karvelas: The reality is most Australians see through the Greens. We’ve got cost of living pressures, which are absolutely real. With the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates 13 times, what you’ve got is mortgage holders under pressure [and] what you’ve got is renters under pressure, and it is a challenge. And that is why we’re trying to increase, through various mechanisms, the amount of supply of housing in this country. The Labor MP Bill Shorten has also been speaking with ABC RN and has been scathing of the Greens – after a bitter housing standoff this week. Josh Butler has an full explainer on this below: Shorten described the Greens as a “formidable and destructive political part of Australian life” and said: Labor and the Liberals, whatever you think of us or the Liberals, we seek to form governments in Australia, and when you form a government, that means you’ve actually got to get things done. The Greens are playing a sort of competition … a party in protest or an outrage factory so they can [be all] things to all people, because they only have to implement their policies. So they play by different set of rules, and what they do is they create anxiety. They create anxiety for people who might want to buy their first home. They create anxiety for our NDIS reforms. They think that [they are morally] superior to people who disagree with them, and I found in political life, [just] because someone disagrees with you doesn’t make them morally inferior, they just have a different proposition or set of values. Dutton responds to modelling showing power bills could rise under nuclear plan Peter Dutton was questioned on new modelling showing power bills could rise by about $665 a year under the Coalition plan to build nuclear plants around Australia. He responded by arguing that power bills had gone up under Labor, and decrying a loss of baseload power under renewables. However, Ameo last month said that Australia’s main power grid would remain reliable as it shifts from coal domination to running overwhelmingly on renewable energy – but only if investments in new generation are delivered “on time and in full”. Adam Morton had the full story: Shorten and Dutton respond to latest job figures The outgoing NDIS minister Bill Shorten and opposition leader Peter Dutton made their regular Friday morning appearance on the Today show just earlier. Shorten was asked about the latest job figures, released yesterday, which dampened hopes of an interest rate cut. He said: Like everyone I hope to see downward pressure on interest rates, although I think it is good that we’re seeing such strong job numbers (with 47,500 jobs added last month). I mean, when you see that under this government nearly a million new jobs are being created, that’s got to be good news. The majority of them are full-time jobs, and most of them are going to women. Dutton responded that people are picking up second and third jobs and working more hours, so “businesses are more reluctant to put people on full time, which is why we see full time numbers come back under this latest announcement”. AMA urging stop to ‘coercive and deceptive’ marketing of commercial foods for infants The Australian Medical Association is calling on the government to implement best practice standards for nutrition in commercial foods for infants and young children. As part of its submission to the Department of Health and Aged Care’s public consultation, the AMA is urging the government to put a stop to what it says is coercive and deceptive marketing of products. This comes as a study found not a single infant or toddler food product stocked in Australian supermarkets meets standards set by the World Health Organization. Natasha May had the full story last month: President Professor Steve Robson said parents and guardians should be able to rely on the government to ensure commercial foods are labelled and marketed responsibly: Many commercial foods for infants and young children fail to support optimal health, growth and development. The nutritional content of many of these products is inadequate and they fall short of international standards for labelling and promotion. Parents and guardians are being bombarded by coercive marketing but do not have enough information about the nutritional quality of the commercial foods being sold to them to be able to make informed choices. To protect our youngest Australians, comprehensive changes to the composition, texture, and labelling of commercial foods for infants and young children are imperative. The AMA says the changes must be mandatory, and compliance must be strictly monitored and enforced. Australia’s ‘sex report card’ released The latest Australian Study of Health and Relationships was revealed at a conference in Sydney this week held by the International Union Against Sexually Transmitted Infections. It doesn’t sound much fun but the results are basically our sex report card and make for fascinating reading. They show, for example, that one third of Australians have searched for a partner online. Natasha May has the full story here: Welfare advocates warn rent assistance rise will do little amid housing crisis The Albanese government’s promised 10% increase to commonwealth rent assistance begins today, but welfare advocates warn it will do little to help. The changes will come in line with indexation, which varies based on the payment. Single recipients receiving the maximum rate of rent assistance will get an extra $23 per fortnight If they are renting on their own. Families with one or two children get an extra $27.02. But welfare advocates said it will do little help in the midst of a housing crisis. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson Kristin O’Connell said: Rent assistance went up by $25 and … average rents have gone up by more than $100. What might look like a big percentage increase is, frankly, fuck all, and that’s one of the reasons that this is so upsetting. The latest Quarterly Rental Review Report showed the median weekly rent value across all Australian dwellings hit a fresh record high of $627 per week, and rental costs range from $770 per week in Sydney, to $547 in Hobart. A major issue with rent assistance is that around 300,000 people who receive it actually lose money every six months when it is indexed, O’Connell said: When CRA is indexed, the amount of rent that you have to pay before you get any rent assistance increases. So the proportion of your rent, where you qualify for it, reduces if you aren’t receiving the maximum payment. Victoria’s housing crisis has worsened on nearly every key indicator one year since the state government’s housing statement, which set to tackle affordability by building 800,000 new homes and increasing renters rights. The Council to Homeless Persons’ new Housing Insecurity Index shows: Annual rents rose 13.3% across the state, with a 14.6% increase in Melbourne, and 5.3% in regional areas. The public housing waiting list is now at 61,587. The number of people who received support from specialist homelessness services in Victoria increased from 30,510 in July 2017 to 32,496 in June 2024. The number of people accessing specialist homelessness services because of housing stress has been above 10,000 for every month since January 2023. Proportion of social housing in Victoria’s total housing stock is just 2.8% – the lowest in Australia. CHP chief executive Deborah Di Natale says the index shows the state government must show more ambition: Things have actually gotten worse for Victorians at the brink of homelessness since the government unveiled its Housing Statement last year. She called on the government to commit to building at least 6000 new public and community homes each year for a decade. And happy Friday – thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be with you on the live blog for most of today. As always, you can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s get started. The Albanese government has announced a range of measures to combat cost of living pressures, including what it claims is the the first back-to-back increase to commonwealth rent assistance ever and the indexation of pensions and payments. In a joint statement today, treasurer Jim Chalmers and minister for social services Amanda Rishworth said “we recognise that people are under the pump and we’re doing something about it”. We’re already rolling out tax cuts and energy rebates and from today we’ll give people more help to pay the rent and deliver an increase to pensions and payments including the age pension. Some of the measures include: Increasing rent assistance by 10% plus indexation, which they claim will benefit nearly a million households around the country. The latest round of payment indexation including for the age pension, disability support pension, jobseeker, carer payment and parenting payment, set to benefit more than five million households. Jobseeker recipients with an assessed partial capacity to work of less than 15 hours per week will move to the higher rate, receiving an increase of $71.20 a fortnight combined with indexation. Income limits for the commonwealth seniors health card will also increase to $99,025 for singles and $158,440 for couples (combined). Mortgage holders may have to wait longer for an interest rate reprieve, following stronger than expected jobs figures, reports AAP. The Commonwealth Bank has shifted its forecast for when the Reserve Bank will lower the official cash rate, now saying a 0.25 percentage point reduction will happen in December, as opposed to previous predictions of a November rate cut. The revised forecast followed the unemployment rate staying at 4.2% for August, with the number of jobs added to the market almost double what economists had predicted. Commonwealth Bank’s head of Australian economics Gareth Aird said: The recent strength in employment growth coupled with still relatively hawkish rhetoric from the RBA governor means we now see December as the more likely month for the start of normalising the cash rate. We expect the RBA will commence an easing cycle before it declares we have hit full employment given policy is currently restrictive. Not all the ducks have lined up for a November rate cut. The Reserve Bank will meet on Tuesday to determine whether to cut the official cash rate of 4.35% or leave it on hold. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie has announced her former upper house colleague Rex Patrick will lead the minor party’s ticket in South Australia in the upcoming federal election. In a statement on Friday morning, Lambie said she shared the same values as Patrick, who was a senator between 2017 and 2022, and Australia needed him back in Canberra. Lambie said: Rex is known as the ‘Transparency Warrior’ for good reason, he works hard to hold the government accountable. He should be in the Senate where he can continue to represent the interests of everyday Australians. Rex’s departure from the Senate was a loss for all of us, but particularly South Australia. We need to get Rex back into the Senate so SA once again has a sensible voice representing them in Canberra. Since leaving the federal parliament at the last election, Patrick has ruffled feathers in Canberra for his work as an avid freedom of information campaigner. One of his most recent fights in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to prevent a common practice of shredding documents once a minister leaves office. The act prevents attempts at successfully attaining documents through FoI requests. Howard says US political system ‘far inferior’ to Australia’s In his interview with Nine, John Howard said political events seen in the US showed its system had major deficiencies compared to Australia’s. Everything we’re witnessing in America tells us is that their political system is far inferior to ours. In a parliamentary system, Donald Trump would never have got to the leadership of the Republicans, and I don’t think Kamala Harris would ever have got to the leadership of the Democrats. We wouldn’t have gone through the agony the Democrats went through regarding Joe Biden. They have a different system. And my take, my very strong view, is that a parliamentary system is much better than a presidential system. Former Liberal prime minister John Howard has taken aim at Donald Trump, describing him as “not compatible with democracy”. Howard, who took Australia into Afghanistan and the Iraq war alongside the United States during his time in office, said the Republican candidate’s refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election meant he would not want Trump to win this time. Howard said in an interview with Nine News: In normal circumstances, I would unhesitatingly favour a Republican victory, but there are reasons that prevent me doing that on this occasion. In other words, I think his refusal to accept the result of the last election and various attempts to overturn that result not compatible with democracy. When you play the democratic game, you’ve got to accept the democratic result… The choice the American people must make is a difficult choice - I’m glad I don’t have a vote there, because I think it would be very hard. I’m not impressed with Kamala Harris. I don’t think she’s got a very good idea of how to run the American economy. I worry that she might lead an administration that will spend far too much, and some of that expenditure will be irresponsible ... she leads a party that, generally speaking, favours far too much government intervention for my liking. Good morning and welcome to our Friday rolling news blog. Emily Wind will be along soon to bring you all the breaking stories of the day but before that this is Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories. After a week in which a Guardian Australia investigation has revealed the huge profits being made by online real estate portals from charging sellers, the former chair of Australia’s competition law enforcer says he believes the regulator should consider investigating the behaviour of the market’s leading portal, realestate.com.au, for potential anti-competitive behaviour. Rod Sims told us the behaviour of realestate.com.au was “well worth considering under section 45 of the Competition and Consumer Act”. Former Liberal prime minister John Howard has taken aim at Donald Trump, describing him as “not compatible with democracy”. Howard, who took Australia into Afghanistan and the Iraq war alongside the United States during his time in office, said the Republican candidate’s refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election meant he would not want Trump to win this time. More on this soon. The Albanese government has announced a range of measures to combat cost of living pressures, including what it claims is the the first back-to-back increase to Commonwealth rent assistance ever and the indexation of pensions and payments. In less good news for households, the Commonwealth Bank has pushed back its forecast for when the Reserve Bank will lower the official cash rate, now saying a 0.25 percentage point reduction will happen in December, as opposed to previous predictions of a November rate cut. More coming up."

                    "bodyText": "Social media and online video companies are collecting huge troves of your personal information on and off their websites or apps and sharing it with a wide range of third-party entities, a new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff report on nine tech companies confirms. The FTC report published on Thursday looked at the data-gathering practices of Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Amazon, Snap, TikTok and Twitter/X between January 2019 and 31 December 2020. The majority of the companies’ business models incentivized tracking how people engaged with their platforms, collecting their personal data and using it to determine what content and ads users see on their feeds, the report states. The FTC’s findings validate years of reporting on the depth and breadth of these companies’ tracking practices and call out the tech firms for “vast surveillance of users”. The agency is recommending Congress pass federal privacy regulations based on what it has documented. In particular, the agency is urging lawmakers to recognize that the business models of many of these companies do little to incentivize effective self-regulation or protection of user data. “Recognizing this basic fact is important for enforcers and policymakers alike because any efforts to limit or regulate how these firms harvest troves of people’s personal data will conflict with their primary business incentives,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “To craft effective rules or remedies limiting this data collection, policymakers will need to ensure that violating the law is not more lucrative than abiding by it.” The FTC is also asking that the companies mentioned in the report invest in “limiting data retention and sharing, restricting targeted advertising, and strengthening protections for teens”. Notably, the report highlights how consumers have little control over how these companies use and share their personal details. Most companies collected or inferred demographic information about users such as age, gender and language. Some collected information about household income, education and parental and marital status. But even when this type of personal information was not explicitly collected, some companies could analyze user behavior on the platform to deduce the details of their personal lives without their knowledge. For instance, some companies’ user interest categories included “baby, kids and maternity”, which would reveal parental status, or “newlyweds” and “divorce support”, which would reveal marital status. This information was then used by some companies to tailor what content people saw to increase engagement on their platforms. In some cases, that demographic information was shared with third-party entities to help target them with more relevant advertisements. Whatever product was in use, it was not easy to opt out of data collection, according to the FTC. Nearly all the companies said they fed personal information to automated systems, most often to serve content and advertisements. On the flipside, almost none of them offered “a comprehensive ability to directly control or opt-out of use of their data by all Algorithms, Data Analytics, or AI”, per the report. Several firms say it’s impossible to even compile a full list of who they share your data with. When the companies were asked to enumerate which advertisers, data brokers or other entities they shared consumer data with, none of these nine firms provided the FTC with a full inventory. The FTC also found that despite evidence that children and teens use many of these platforms, many of the tech companies reported that, because their platforms are not directed at children, they do not need different data-sharing practices for children under 13 years of age. According to the report, none of the companies reported having data-sharing practices that treated the information collected about and from 13- to 17-year-olds via their sites and apps differently than adult data, even though data about minors is more sensitive. The FTC called the companies’ data-minimization practices “woefully inadequate”, finding that some of the companies did not delete information when users requested it. “Even those Companies that actually deleted data would only delete some data, but not all,” the report stated. “That is the most basic requirement,” said Mario Trujillo, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The fact that some weren’t doing that even in the face of state privacy laws that require it proves that stronger enforcement is needed, especially from consumers themselves.” Some of the firms have disputed the report’s findings. In a statement, Discord said the FTC report was an important step but lumped “very different models into one bucket”. “Discord’s business model is very different – we are a real-time communications platform with strong user privacy controls and no feeds for endless scrolling. At the time of the study, Discord did not run a formal digital advertising service,” Kate Sheerin, Discord’s head of public policy in the US and Canada, said in a statement. A Google spokesperson said the company had the strictest privacy policies in the industry. “We never sell people’s personal information and we don’t use sensitive information to serve ads. We prohibit ad personalization for users under 18 and we don’t personalize ads to anyone watching ‘made for kids content’ on YouTube,” said Google spokesperson, José Castañeda. The other firms either did not provide an on-the-record comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, if companies dispute the FTC’s findings, the onus is on them to provide evidence, says the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic), a Washington DC-based public interest research organization focused on privacy and free speech. “I used to work in privacy compliance for companies, and let’s just say I believe absolutely nothing without documentation to back up claims,” said Epic global privacy counsel, Calli Schroeder. “And I agree with the FTC’s conclusion that self-regulation is a failure. Companies have repeatedly shown that their priority is profit and they will only take consumer protection and privacy issues seriously when failing to do so affects that profit.”"

                    "headline": "Google says UK risks being ‘left behind’ in AI race without more data centres",
                    "bodyText": "Google has said that Britain risks being left behind in the global artificial intelligence race unless the government moves quickly to build more datacentres and let tech companies use copyrighted work in their AI models. The company pointed to research showing that the UK is ranked seventh on a global AI readiness index for data and infrastructure, and called for a number of policy changes. Google’s UK managing director, Debbie Weinstein, said that the government “sees the opportunity” in AI but needs to introduce more policies boosting its deployment. “We have a lot of advantages and a lot of history of leadership in this space, but if we do not take proactive action, there is a risk that we will be left behind,” she said. AI is undergoing a global investment boom after breakthroughs in the technology led by the release of the ChatGPT chatbot, from the US company OpenAI, and other companies like Google, which has produced a powerful AI model called Gemini. However, government-backed AI projects have been early victims of cost-cutting by Keir Starmer’s government. In August, Labour confirmed it would not push ahead with unfunded commitments of £800m for the creation of an exascale supercomputer – considered key infrastructure for AI research – and a further £500m for the AI Research Resource, which funds computing power for AI. Asked about the supercomputer decision, Weinstein referred to the government’s forthcoming “AI action plan” under the tech entrepreneur Matt Clifford. “We’re hopeful to see a really comprehensive view around what are the investments that we need to make in the UK,” she said. Google has outlined its UK policy suggestions in a document called “unlocking the UK’s AI potential”, which will be released this week, in which it recommends the creation of a “national research cloud”, or a publicly funded mechanism for providing computing power and data – two key factors in building the AI models behind products such as ChatGPT – to startups and academics. The report adds that the UK “struggles to compete with other countries for data centre investment” and welcomes Labour’s commitment to build more of the centres as it prepares to introduce a new planning and infrastructure bill. Other recommendations in the Google report include setting up a national skills service to help the workforce adapt to AI, and introducing the technology more widely into public services. It also calls for changes to UK copyright laws after the abandonment this year of attempts to draft a new code for using copyrighted material to train AI models. Data from copyright-protected material such as news articles and academic papers is seen as vital for models that underpin tools like chatbots, which are “trained” on billions of words that allow them to understand text-based prompts and predict the right response to them. The same concerns apply to models that make music or images. The Google document calls for the relaxation of restrictions on a practice known as text and data mining (TDM), where copying of copyrighted work is allowed for non-commercial purposes such as academic research. The Conservative government dropped plans to allow TDM for commercial purposes in 2024, amid deep concerns from the creative industries and news publishers. “The unresolved copyright issue is a block to development, and a way to unblock that, obviously, from Google’s perspective, is to go back to where I think the government was in 2023 which was TDM being allowed for commercial use,” said Weinstein. The report also calls for “pro-innovation” regulation, signalling support for the regulatory setup that is in place, where oversight of AI is managed by various public regulators including the Competition and Markets Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office. “We would encourage the government to continue looking first to the existing regulation, as opposed to creating new regulation,” said Weinstein. UK ministers are in the process of drafting a consultation on an AI bill that is reportedly focused on making a voluntary AI model testing agreement between the UK government and tech companies legally binding, as well as making the UK’s AI Safety Institute an arm’s length government body. A UK government spokesperson said: “Our AI opportunities action plan, driven by Matt Clifford, will make sure we have the right AI infrastructure, skills and data access for businesses and public services to unlock its full potential. “But as we do, we must ensure it develops safely to strengthen public trust, which is why we’ll be bringing forward legislation on developers of the most powerful models."

                    "bodyText": "Lionsgate has signed a deal with the artificial intelligence research firm Runway, allowing it access to the company’s large film and TV library to train a new generative model. According to the Wall Street Journal, the model will be “customized to Lionsgate’s proprietary portfolio” which includes hit franchises such as John Wick, Saw and The Hunger Games. The aim is to help film-makers and other creatives “augment their work” through the use of AI. “Runway is a visionary, best-in-class partner who will help us utilize AI to develop cutting-edge, capital-efficient content creation opportunities,” said Michael Burns, Lionsgate’s vice-chair. “Several of our film-makers are already excited about its potential applications to their pre-production and post-production process. We view AI as a great tool for augmenting, enhancing and supplementing our current operations.” Burns believes that the deal will save Lionsgate “millions and millions of dollars”. The technology will be used to help makers storyboard a project before being utilised for background scenery and special effects. Runway hosts an annual AI film festival in both Los Angeles and New York City. The company is in the middle of legal trouble after a group of visual artists claimed that its image-generation system infringed on their copyrights. The news comes after a troubling summer for Lionsgate, which suffered from a string of underperformers at the box office. There were disappointing returns for the company’s reboot of The Crow, Guy Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare and the video game adaptation Borderlands, with the last film estimated to lose Lionsgate between $20m and $30m. This past weekend also saw action comedy The Killer’s Game open to just $2.6m from a $30m budget. The announcement also arrives the day after California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed two bills to restrict the use of AI replicas of performers. The bills had originally been passed in August and were supported by the Hollywood union Screen Actors Guild, following on from last year’s new contract which also brought in new protections. Newsom said: “We’re making sure that no one turns over their name, image and likeness to unscrupulous people without representation or union advocacy.” Last week also saw a new set of guidelines released for documentary film-makers to ensure an ethical use of AI in their work. “In a world where it is becoming difficult to distinguish between a real photograph and a generated one, we believe it’s absolutely pivotal to understand the ways generative AI could impact nonfiction storytelling,” a statement from Archival Producers Alliance read."

                    "bodyText": "This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can find the latest US elections coverage here. Donald Trump says he’s meeting next week with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Associated Press reports. Modi is scheduled to be in the United States next week for the Quad Summit in Delaware in addition to events in New York, according to Indian media reports. There was no meeting with Trump previously reported. Trump referenced his meeting with Modi for the first time while speaking at an unrelated event in Michigan. Indian officials did not immediately confirm the meeting when asked. Trump ends, stopping to take selfies with people, shaking hands, to the tune of YMCA. This event appeared from the livestream to be well-attended and energetic, with loud cheers – and boos, for the Democrats –from the crowd. Trump veered between topics, as he often does, offering confusing and unsubstantiated answers to questions. A voter says he is concerned about taxes. Trump says Harris will double your taxes, which is not true. There are, however, big boos from the crowd. Trump is winding down. He says “Michigan is going to be the most fun” if he wins. He talks about car imports, saying “you can’t flood” the market with imported cars, to energetic cheers. “This will be like taking candy from a baby,” he says. It is unclear whether he is talking about the election or car imports. “The only thing that never gets obsolete is a wall and a wheel. A wall is what we’re talking about right now,” he says. “Just to finish with the border, when I talk about energy, he says, “I believe the border is of the greatest interest.” It is difficult to follow this response to a question from a voter about the cost of food and groceries, which is veering between energy and immigration. Trump is asked by a nurse how he will bring down the cost of food and groceries. “So we have to start always with energy,” he says. “If you make donuts, if you make cars, whatever you make.” He says is plan is to reduce energy bills by 50% in 12 months. He does not explain how he will do this. “We’re going to do what we have to do with the farmers,” he says. He appears to be trying to talk about exporting food. “Interest rates, energy, and common sense,” he says. Then the talks about the border again. On American women’s feelings about Trump, via the Washington Post: President Joe Biden won women by 15 points over Trump in 2020, according to exit polls, up from former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s 13-point victory among women in 2016. Polls suggest that this year, women prefer Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over Trump by similar margins. Harris led Trump by 13 points among women in an ABC News/Ipsos poll released last Sunday. Before the Democratic National Convention last month, the same poll found her leading him by six points among women. He talks about the civilian who took a photograph of the suspect’s number plate, who was a woman. He says “women are smarter than men”. “This woman was unbelievable,” Trump says. “She did an amazing job.” Huckabee Sanders says the takeaway is that the “women of this country love Donald Trump.” Trump talks now about the apparent assassination attempt yesterday. He again thanks the secret service. “These guys do a great job. Now, they do need more people,” he says. “Closing the border” and “drill, baby drill” are two things Trump will get done, he says. He says, “unless you have the death penalty for drug dealers you’ll never get rid of that problem.” The voter asks what the major threat is to manufacturing in Michigan. Trump responds, confusingly, by talking about the threat of nuclear weapons. “You’re not going to care so much about making cars” if that starts to happen, he says. Trump is asked his first question from someone in the crowd, who starts by noting that he attended one of Trump’s rallies and did not fall asleep or leave early. Trump is repeating false, unsubstantiated or unprovable claims about Covid, the 7 October attacks in Israel, inflation, the stock market, immigration, the price of oil, and the amount of oil in America. “This is the world’s longest answer to a question,” he says. Shortly after taking office in January last year, Sarah Huckabee Sanders launched a powerful salvo in the so-called war on woke being waged by Republicans. She is from a well-known Republican family. Her father, Mike Huckabee, was Arkansas’s governor for more than a decade, from 1996 to 2007. She served as Trump’s press secretary for two years. A refresher on how US presidents are elected: The popular vote is the overall number of qualified voters who voted for a given candidate: in other words, the number of ballots cast for one candidate or another. The main thing to know about the popular vote is that winning it does not mean you win the presidency. The presidency is won by the candidate who gains the majority of electoral college votes. In other words: the US election is decided by races in individual states. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump received fewer votes than Hillary Clinton but still won the presidency and in 2000, George W Bush received fewer votes than Al Gore but also won. The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US’s 50 states ahead of the election. Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia – as in Washington DC – is allocated three electoral college votes. A candidate needs more than half – or at least 270 – of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which “allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district”, according to 270towin. • This post was amended on 19 September 2024 to explain that Maine and Nebraska have a different way of allocating electoral college votes. Trump is claiming falsely that he “did much better” in 2020 than 2016. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College in 2020 and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote. In 2016, Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton, and Trump lost the popular vote. Trump is being interviewed by Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She says that Trump will win because America “needs a fighter”. She asks why he wants to be president. “Thank you everybody. A lot of love in this room. I love you, you love me,” Trump says. Trump is speaking now in Michigan. He claims that there are 8,000 people in the audience, and the same number “walking away”, who could not get in. This seems unlikely, and Trump has made false claims about his crowd sizes before. Obama has said Trump is obsessed with the sizes of his crowds. Trump will speak soon at a town hall with Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the town of Flint, in the swing state of Michigan – which has 15 electoral college votes. “I support the second amendment,” he says, referring to America’s “right to bear arms”. Walz is a gun owner and skilled marksman. “But we don’t get to hide behind that when our first responsibility is to protect children,” he says. “These guys talk all the time about families, today they had a vote to protect IVF and they killed it,” Walz says of the Republicans. He talks about his own experiences with IVF, which led to the birth of his daughter, Hope. Freedom is not just a song Kamala Harris comes out to on stage, “although it is very cool” when she does that, says Walz. Republicans want to invade your bedroom, who you love, your school library, he says, as well as the freedom to make decisions about your own body. Some people choose to live their lives differently, he says. The lesson is, “Mind your own damn business,” he says, as he has before – a lesson from Minnesota. Walz says, “after nine long years” Donald Trump, when asked about healthcare during the debate, “gave us a concept of a plan, seriously, none of my students ever gave that weak an answer.” He has compared Trump to the high school students he used to teach a few times during this speech. Walz talks about JD Vance saying he is willing “to create stories” on the campaign trail while defending his spreading false, racist rumours of pets being abducted and eaten in a town in his home state of Ohio. Walz says “no kidding” and that that has been happening for years. “You know who Donald Trump is, you know the pain that he caused, he killed thousands of manufacturing jobs across this state,” he says. Walz is speaking now. He has brought up Donald Trump’s false claims that images of crowds at Harris events are AI. “You know what won’t be AI?” he says: “Your ballots”. As we wait for Tim Walz to start speaking in the swing state of North Carolina, here is a refresher on the electoral college: The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US’s 50 states ahead of the election. North Carolina has 16 Electoral College votes, or almost 6%. Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia – as in Washington DC – is allocated three electoral college votes. This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC. A candidate needs more than half – or at least 270 – of the electoral college votes to win. All the votes from a given state go to the same candidate. The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate. This happens a few weeks after the November election – and after US states have certified their election results – on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. In 2020 Donald Trump tried to remove electors in some states ahead of the electoral college vote but the US supreme court rejected that attempt the week before. Kamala Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, is about to begin speaking in Asheville in the swing state of North Carolina – which has 16 electoral college votes. We will bring key points from those remarks to you live. Meanwhile, if you’re just tuning in, Kamala Harris was interviewed by a panel of three National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) members, during which the vice-president talked about the anti-immigrant sentiment toward Haitians in Springfield, Ohio; Israel’s war in Gaza; domestic economic issues; gun violence; and reproductive rights. The conversation was one of the few interviews Harris has done since becoming the Democratic nominee, and it served as an opportunity for her to reaffirm policies. When asked about “where [she] sees the line in terms of aggression and defense” in regards to the war, she said that she supported the Biden administration’s one-time pause on the delivery of 2,000lb bombs to Israel as “leverage” that they “have had and used”, but that achieving a deal was the real means to ending the war. “We have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two-state solution because there must be stability and peace in that region,” she said, “inasmuch as our goal must be to ensure that Israelis have security and Palestinians in equal measure have security, self determination, dignity”. When asked what mechanisms the US has to support Palestinian self-determination, and whether or not it was even possible, as Israel’s ally, to support such a goal, Harris responded saying that she believed that it was. She described meetings with Israeli and Arab leaders to “talk about how we can construct a day-after scenario”. JD Vance is speaking during a campaign event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The Guardian’s Alice Herman is there. She writes: Vance has spoken at length about immigration, invoking a crime committed by an undocumented immigrant in the town of Prairie du Chien that Republicans in the state have already seized on to bolster GOP claims about immigrants committing violent crimes. (In fact, research shows immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than people born in the US). “We are closer, in this moment, to a nuclear war, or a third world war, than at any time in our country’s history and we have the chaos and incompetence of Kamala Harris to thank for it,” Vance said. “Every community is a border state,” he said. “The problems that Kamala Harris has imported through that American Southern border have now gone nationwide.” He also blamed Harris for the recent apparent assassination attempt at Mar-a-Lago. “The American media, the Democrats, the Kamala Harris campaign, they’ve gotta cut this crap out or they’re gonna get somebody killed,” said Vance, alleging that Democrats, who have highlighted Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric and attempts to overturn the 2020 election, are to blame for the two assassination attempts that Trump has faced so far during his 2024 campaign. Senate Republicans defeated a bill that would have protected access to IVF care, brought by Democrats seeking to pressure Republicans over the politically volatile topic that is sure to be on voters’ minds when they head to the presidential polls in 49 days. Kamala Harris said Republicans’ refusal to vote in favor of protecting IVF despite claiming to support access “is not an isolated incident”. Over in the House, the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, announced plans for the chamber to vote tomorrow on a spending bill that will prevent a partial government shutdown but be paired with legislation aimed at cracking down on non-citizen voting, which rarely happens. Democrats have come out against the latter part of the bill, with Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer saying today that Johnson’s proposal will likely meet “a dead end”, though that could increase the possibility of a government shutdown. Here’s what else has happened today so far: Kamala Harris just said she called Donald Trump after the Secret Service on Sunday fended off a gunman discovered outside a golf course where he was playing. “I checked on him to see if he was okay, and I told him what I have said publicly – there’s no place for political violence in our country,” she said. In a conversation with the National Association of Black Journalists, Harris also condemned the campaign against the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield, Ohio, waged by Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and conservative commentators. “It’s a crying shame,” the vice-president said. In a statement responding to the shocking report in ProPublica, Harris also said anti-abortion laws supported by Trump were to blame for the death of a 28-year-old Georgia woman. In an interview with popular Spanish radio host Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis, Harris warned that Trump’s policies would result in the separation of migrant families at the southern border. Trump said Joe Biden was “very nice” when the president called him after the second assassination attempt against him on Sunday, and asked if he had any suggestions for how to improve his security. Arizona’s top elections official said Tuesday that a newly identified error in the state’s voter registration process needs to be swiftly resolved, as early ballots are scheduled to go out to some voters as soon as this week. Election staff in the Maricopa county recorder’s office identified an issue last week, which concerns voters with old drivers licenses who may never have provided documentary proof of citizenship but were coded as having provided it and therefore were able to vote full ballots. The state has a bifurcated system in which voters who do not provide documentary proof of citizenship cannot vote in local or state elections, only federal ones. Because of the state’s very close elections and status as a swing state, the issue affecting nearly 100,000 voters will likely be the subject of intense scrutiny and litigation in the coming weeks. Arizona has more than 4.1 million registered voters. Governor Katie Hobbs directed the motor vehicles division to fix the coding error, which the secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, said was already resolved going forward. It’s not clear if any of these voters have unlawfully cast a ballot or if they have already provided proof of citizenship. People who register to vote check a box on registration forms, under penalty of perjury, declaring they are citizens. “We have no reason to believe that there are any significant numbers of individuals remaining on this list who are not eligible to vote in Arizona,” Fontes said in a press conference Tuesday. “We cannot confirm that at this moment, but we don’t have any reason to believe that.” The error, reported by Votebeat on Tuesday, relates to several quirks of Arizona governance. Since 1996, Arizona residents have been required to show proof of citizenship to get a regular driver’s license. And since 2004, they have been required to show proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections. State drivers licenses also do not expire until a driver is age 65, meaning for some residents, they will have a valid license for decades before needing renewal. These factors play into the error. The issue has split the Republican recorder in the state’s largest county, Maricopa, and the Democratic secretary of state. Recorder Stephen Richer is arguing that these voters should only be able to cast a federal-only ballot, while Fontes says the state should keep the status quo of allowing them to vote full ballots given how soon the election is. Fontes directed counties to allow these residents to cast full ballots this year. Read more here: Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has said that Republicans would do well to help avert a looming government shutdown. The path to preventing a shutdown, as ever, remains shrouded. House leader Mike Johnson’s current proposal – which extends funding while also folding in a Republican measure requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote in national elections – lacks even enough Republican votes to pass. Non-citizen voting is already illegal and voter fraud by non-citizens is virtually non-existent, and the inclusion of the measure, which would add barriers to voting for US citizens, is a nonstarter for Democrats in the Senate. Meanwhile, far-right Republicans say Johnson’s proposal doesn’t go far enough in pushing their agenda, and see the threat of shutdown as an opportunity to push Democrats to compromise on immigration and other issues. Since Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid in July, Democrats have showered her campaign with cash. Last month alone, the vice-president raised $361m, tripling Donald Trump’s fundraising haul of $130m for the month. According to Harris’s campaign, she brought in $540m in the six weeks after Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race. Democratic congressional candidates appear to be benefiting from this financial windfall as well, as Republicans sound the alarm about their fundraising deficit in key races that will determine control of the House and Senate in November. But in one crucial area, Republicans maintain a substantial cash advantage over Democrats: state legislative races. In recent years, Republicans have controlled more state legislative chambers than Democrats, giving them more power over those states’ budgets, election laws and abortion policies. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which supports the party’s state legislative candidates, has raised $35m between the start of 2023 and the end of this June, the committee told the Guardian. In comparison, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) – which invests in an array of state-level campaigns, such as supreme court races, in addition to legislative campaigns – has raised $62m in the same time period. That resource gap is now rearing its head in key battleground states, the DLCC says. In Pennsylvania, a crucial state for the presidential and congressional maps, Republican state legislative candidates have spent $4.5m on paid advertisements, compared with $1.4m for Democratic candidates. “When we think about the context of what’s at stake, we think about more than 65 million people being covered by our target map this year,” said Heather Williams, president of the DLCC. “And that means that the rights of all those people will be determined by who’s in power the day after the election.” Read more here: A national voter poll from Monmouth has found that there are fewer “double haters” – voters that dislike both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates – since Kamala Harris joined the race. Only 7% of voters polled in this latest round favored neither Donald Trump nor Harris – compared to 16% of disliked both Trump and Joe Biden. “Senate Republicans put politics first and families last again today by blocking the Right to IVF Act for the second time since June,” said Emilia Rowland, national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. Rowland warned that Donald Trump, who claimed to be a “leader” on IVF during his debate against Kamala Harris last week, would jeopardize access to fertility treatments if he wins in November. “Voters know the difference between words and actions,” she said. “And between now and November, they will turn out against Republicans from the top to bottom of the ballot.” JD Vance is scheduled to speak in an hour at an event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The last time I was at this event space was for one of Kamala Harris’s inaugural rallies, which was held on the sprawling grounds adjacent to the hall where Vance will speak today. Cathy Weber, a retired farmer and military serviceperson, said she came to see Vance speak to get a better sense of who he is as a politician. When I asked about Vance’s comments about Haitian immigrants, she said she thought “he misspoke,” and chalked it up to being a younger politician – which she viewed as an asset. “He’s 39,” said Weber. “I said to my son: ‘That’s your generation, that’s our future.’” As the Guardian’s Robert Tait reported earlier this month, JD Vance has a history of opposing IVF – in contradiction to the Republican party and Donald Trump’s current stance that they support it: In 2017, months into Trump’s presidency, Vance wrote the foreword to the Index of Culture and Opportunity, a collection of essays by conservative authors for the Heritage Foundation that included ideas for encouraging women to have children earlier and promoting a resurgence of “traditional” family structure. The essays lauded the increase in state laws restricting abortion rights and included arguments that the practice should become “unthinkable” in the US, a hardline posture the Democrats now say is the agenda of Trump and Vance, who they accuse of harbouring the intent to impose a national ban following a 2022 supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade and annulling the federal right to abort a pregnancy. The report also includes an essay lamenting the spread of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other fertility treatments, with the author attributing them as reasons for women delaying having children and prioritising higher education rather than starting families. IVF has emerged as an issue in November’s presidential race after Trump said last week that he favoured it being covered by government funding or private health insurance companies – a stance seeming at odds with many Republicans, including Vance, who was one of 47 GOP senators to vote against a bill in June intended to expand access to the treatment. Kamala Harris said that Senate Republicans refusal to vote in favor of protecting IVF “is not an isolated incident”: Every woman in every state must have reproductive freedom. Yet, Republicans in Congress have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child. Congressional Republicans’ repeated refusal to protect access to IVF is not an isolated incident. Extremist so-called leaders have launched a full-on attack against reproductive freedom across our country. In the more than two years since Roe v Wade was overturned, they have proposed and passed abortion bans that criminalize doctors and make no exception for rape or incest. They have also blocked legislation to protect the right to contraception and proposed four national abortion bans. Their opposition to a woman’s freedom to make decisions about her own body is extreme, dangerous and wrong. Our administration will always fight to protect reproductive freedoms, which must include access to IVF. We stand with the majority of Americans – Republicans and Democrats alike – who support protecting access to fertility treatments. And we continue to call on Congress to finally pass a bill that restores reproductive freedom. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, pointed to the failure of the IVF bill today as proof that Republicans’ promise to protect access to in vitro fertilization is hollow: Meanwhile, John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota, called the bill “an attempt by Democrats to try and create a political issue where there isn’t one”. Before its convention this year, the Republican party adopted a policy platform that supports states establishing fetal personhood, while also, contradictorily, encouraging support for IVF. But the platform does not explain how IVF could be legally protected if frozen embryos are given the same rights as people. Senate Republicans voted to block a bill that would have ensured access to in vitro fertilization nationwide. Every Republican, except Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted against the measure. Though a majority of 51 voted in favor, the bill needed 60 votes to pass. Democrats had brought the measure back to the floor after Republicans previously blocked it from advancing in June. Democrats have been pushing the issue this year after the Alabama’s supreme court ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law, leading several clinics in the state to suspend IVF treatment. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have scrambled to counter what could be a deeply unpopular stance against IVF. Pop music superstar Billie Eilish along with her brother, producer and musician Finneas O’Connell, have announced their support for Kamala Harris. In a video posted on X, where Eilish has 7.5 million followers, and Instagram, where her followers number 119 million, the siblings say they will vote for Harris because she supports for keeping abortion legal, and fighting the climate crisis: They are the last pop megastars to back the Democratic vice-president, after Taylor Swift announced she would vote for Harris following her debate with Donald Trump last week. Earlier in her conversation with the National Association of Black Journalists, Kamala Harris was asked about her message to the young Black voters who polls show are leaning towards voting for Donald Trump because they believe he will provide more economic opportunities. If that dynamic plays out, it could have severe consequences for both Harris and Democrats nationwide, since Black voters have long been a cornerstone voting bloc. “I think it’s very important to not operate from the assumption that Black men are in anybody’s pocket,” Harris replied. “Black men are like any other voting group. You got to earn their vote. So I’m working to earn the vote, not assuming I’m going to have it because I am Black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize the needs of all communities, and I intend to be a president for all people, specifically as it relates to what we need to do.” Kamala Harris just said she called Donald Trump earlier today after the Secret Service on Sunday fended off a gunman discovered outside a golf course where he was playing. “I checked on him to see if he was okay, and I told him what I have said publicly, there’s no place for political violence in our country,” Harris said. “I am in this election and this race for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy, there is no place for political violence. We can and should have healthy debates and discussion and disagreements, but not resort to violence to resolve those issues.” Harris also responded “I do”, when asked if she had confidence in the Secret Service, then said that rightwing attacks have made groups including migrants and LGBTQ+ people feel unsafe. “Yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn’t change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country and doing everything we can to again, lift people up and not beat people down so they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like they’re somehow not a part of it or us,” she said. At that, the conversation wrapped up. Kamala Harris has condemned the campaign against the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield, Ohio, waged by Donald Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and conservative commentators. “It’s a crying shame,” the vice-president said in her ongoing conversation with Black journalists in Philadelphia. “My heart breaks for this community.” Without mentioning Trump or Vance, Harris described the baseless allegations that Haitians who moved to the Ohio city were eating people’s pets as irresponsible: When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that. That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment, this concept of the public trust, to then understand what the public trust means. It means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself, and especially when you have been and then seek to be again president of the United States of America. She also decried the wave of threats that have closed schools and other buildings in Springfield, noting the toll it has taken on law enforcement: It’s a crying shame, literally, what’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of, look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive, good life before this happened, and spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age old. More on the threats that have disrupted daily life in Springfield for days: Kamala Harris was pressed by her interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists event about what specific changes she would make to US policy towards Israel and its invasion of Gaza. “In the way that we send weapons, in the way that we interact as their ally, are there specific policy changes?” asked Politico reporter Eugene Daniels, one of three interviewers on the panel. Harris replied: For example, one of the things that we have done that I am entirely supportive of, is the pause that we put on the 2,000lb bombs. And so there is some leverage that we have had and used, but ultimately, the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done. And I’m not going to disclose private conversations, but I will tell you, I’ve had direct conversations with the prime minister, with the president of Israel, with Egyptian leaders and with our allies, and I think we’ve made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out. Washington has supplied many of the bombs used in Israel’s assault on the enclave, but recently blocked a shipment of 2,000lb munitions blamed for strikes that have killed scores of people in Gaza. Here’s more on that: Kamala Harris is on stage now in Philadelphia, taking questions from three reporters in a live conservation organized by the National Association of Black Journalists. In July, Donald Trump spoke at the group’s annual convention, where he said Harris was lying about her racial identity. Here’s our coverage of that infamous moment: The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, has condemned as “dangerous” comments made by JD Vance that the difference between Democratic rhetoric and Republican rhetoric in this election is that only Donald Trump – the Republican party nominee for president – has been shot at. Vance, the Republican nominee for vice-president, has pointed out on the campaign trail that nobody has tried to assassinate Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ nominee for president, only her rival, Trump. Trump was shot at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July and a man was arrested pointing a rifle through the fence of Trump’s golf course this last Sunday, as the former president was playing a round. Vance said at a rally in Sparta, Michigan, moments ago that “what’s one-sided is that it’s Donald Trump who’s getting shot at” and he said at a previous event that the difference between the effects of both parties’ rhetoric is that “no-one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months”. Jean-Pierre said at the ongoing press briefing just now: “When you are a national leader and you have a community that looks up to your leadership … and when you have that type of language out there, it’s dangerous … [and] it opens up an opportunity for people to listen to you and potentially take you very seriously.” Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Joe Biden would travel to New York City next week to attend the United Nations General Assembly. The press briefing just got under way at the White House. Jean-Pierre made the announcement about the US president at the top of the briefing and will take journalists’ questions shortly. World leaders will descend on the UN headquarters in New York for the annual gathering. Israel’s war in Gaza will probably be a headline issue at this year’s gathering. The attack on southern Israel lead by Hamas last 7 October occurred after last fall’s UNGA event. Israel’s counterattack on Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, has raged since and a lasting ceasefire remains elusive. The death toll among Palestinians has passed 41,000, according to health authorities in the territory. The Guardian is covering the latest events in this war and the current news out of Lebanon today in this live blog. JD Vance has called for stepped-up security for Donald Trump following two apparent assassination attempts on the former president in the last two months, asking for him to have Secret Service resources equivalent to those afforded to Joe Biden, the sitting US president. Vance, Trump’s running mate on the Republican ticket for this November’s presidential election, also blamed Democratic party rhetoric criticizing Trump for armed individuals targeting the former president. “Democrats have got to cut this crap out,” he said. He repeatedly criticized Kamala Harris, the Democratic party nominee for president, across policy platforms ranging from energy to taxes. She said, after a man was arrested on Sunday after pointing a rifle through the fence at Trump’s golf course in Florida as the former president was playing a round: “I will be clear: I condemn political violence.” Asked by a journalist if the rhetoric was all one-sided, Vance said “there are absolutely people on our side who say ridiculous things”, but he added that “what is one-sided” is that only one person was being targeted by known gunmen. “It’s Donald Trump who’s getting shot at,” he said, reiterating that Democrats should stop talking in tones of eliminating him as a threat. “They are going to get someone killed,” he said. The Republicans’ vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, is on the campaign trail talking in Sparta, near Grand Rapids in central Michigan, the vital swing state, right now. The White House daily media briefing, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, has been moved back to 2pm, from its previous schedule of 1.30pm. Vance is talking about prices, the cost of food, gas, housing, saying “the number one thing” the US has to do to get “this crazy inflation” under control is to have better energy supply from the US. “Drill, baby, drill,” Vance said. He said the US has “abundant American energy” and natural resources that are the envy of other countries. Senate Democrats will later this afternoon hold a vote on protecting access to IVF care, as they seek to pressure Republicans over the politically volatile topic that will sure to be on voters’ minds when they head to the presidential polls in 49 days. Over in the House, the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, announced plans for the chamber to vote tomorrow on a spending bill that will prevent a partial government shutdown but be paired with legislation aimed at cracking down on non-citizen voting, which rarely happens. Democrats have come out against the latter part of the bill, with Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer saying today that Johnson’s proposal will likely meet “a dead end”, though that could increase the possibility of a government shutdown. Here’s what else has happened today so far: Kamala Harris said anti-abortion laws supported by Donald Trump were to blame for the death of a Georgia woman. In an interview with popular Spanish radio host Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis, Harris warned that Trump’s policies would result in the separation of migrant families at the southern border. Trump said Joe Biden was “very nice” when the president called him after the second assassination attempt against him on Sunday, and asked if he had any suggestions for how to improve his security. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who conceived her daughters using IVF and sponsored the bill coming up for a vote today to protect the fertility treatment, accused Trump and Vance of “lying about their records on IVF, and pretending to champion this cause”. Speaking on the campaign call, Duckworth said Vance’s decision to campaign instead of returning to Washington to vote for her bill was proof that “when given the chance, they’ll never actually do anything to support IVF”. “I’m not going to sit quietly while Donald Trump and JD Vance run on a platform that would threaten access to IVF,” she said, “because every American deserves their right to be called mommy or daddy without being treated like a criminal.” On the call, Democratic lawmakers said Americans should not trust Donald Trump when he says he does not support an abortion ban, and noted that he has bragged about appointing the supreme court justices whose votes were decisive to overturning Roe. “This is somebody who has started a complete crisis, healthcare crisis for women in this country, and now he’s trying to scramble and somehow, as he always does, say it’s not his fault,” Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow said. Even if Republicans fail to muster the 60 votes needed to enact a federal abortion ban, she pointed to the conservative blueprint, Project 2025, which was created by former Trump officials and suggests invoking an archaic law to ban the distribution of the pills used in medical abortions. Trump has sought to distance himself from the lengthy policy document. “Everything that we have seen so far – the efforts by states that he has supported – would indicate to us that that’s very much a part of his toolbox,” Stabenow said. Abortion remains Harris’s strongest issue, on which she holds a 15-percentage-point advantage over Trump, a national poll of likely voters by the New York Times and Siena College found. Yet there were some signs Trump’s mixed signals over his stance on abortion had muddied the waters. According to the survey, nearly half of independent voters say they did not think the former president would sign into law a national abortion ban. The Harris campaign has responded with a swing state ad buy highlighting Trump’s comments bragging about his role overturning Roe. “Make no mistake: Donald Trump is to blame for, you know, what we are seeing across this country,” Julie Chávez Rodríguez, the Harris-Walz campaign manager, said on the call. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said Donald Trump was “scrambling” to rewrite his position on reproductive rights amid a political backlash and fears that a Republican administration would curtail access to IVF. “There’s no way in the world that I believe that Donald Trump is serious about this,” Staebnow said. The former president last month announced plans, without offering any detail, to require the federal government or health insurance companies to cover the cost of fertility treatments, which can be tens of thousands of dollars. Stabenow, on a call organized by the Harris campaign, said Tuesday’s vote was all the more important after Trump’s claim that he is a “leader on IVF”. “Be great if he was,” she said. “And the way to find out if he’s serious? Was he on the phone last night, calling our colleagues, urging them to vote yes, just like he was on the phone last weekend, urging the US House to shut the government down, just like he was on the phone telling people to vote against the effective border bill. If he was on the phone last night urging people to vote yes, then I’ll take him seriously.” Republicans are expected to block the procedural measure to open debate on the Democrats’ bill to protect IVF. JD Vance, the Ohio senator who voted against the bill earlier this year, is campaigning in the midwest and will miss the vote. Senate Democrats are holding a press conference on the steps of the Capitol, where they are pushing Republicans to allow passage of legislation protecting access to IVF care nationwide. The party holds a majority of 51 seats in the chamber, but most legislation needs at least 60 votes to overcome filibusters. “Here’s what we’re asking our Republican friends: do you support American families’ access to in vitro fertilization or not?” the majority leader, Chuck Schumer said, as he was flanked by lawmakers holding up pictures of families who had children through IVF. “For many Americans, starting a family is one of the greatest joys there is. Yet millions of Americans struggle with the defeating battle of infertility every single year.” He accused the GOP of being insincere about protecting access to the care: In Alabama this year, we saw just how vulnerable IVF has become as the next target of ultra conservatives. Since then, we’ve seen Republicans tie themselves in knots over their support for IVF, claiming they support access to IVF, support insurance paying for IVF treatments, support helping families pay for IVF. And then when the rubber hits the road, they vote no, because here’s the secret, Republicans want people to think they support IVF because they know how unpopular that position is. They want to keep their true agenda hidden from the public. The Senate’s Democratic majority will today try once again to pass legislation protecting access to IVF care nationwide, but Republicans are likely to block its passage. Democrats have seized on the issue every since Alabama’s supreme court earlier this year handed down a ruling that cut off most access to the treatment used to start families, until its Republican-controlled legislature passed a law that restored access. In remarks today on the Senate floor, the Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, warned that IVF remained under threat, and federal legislation was necessary to guarantee access across the country. “Sadly, access to IVF can no longer be taken from granted. From the moment the Maga supreme court eliminated Roe, the hard-right made clear that they would keep going. As we saw earlier this year in Alabama, IVF has become the next target of ultra-conservatives, and access to this incredible treatment is more vulnerable than ever,” Schumer said. He tied the GOP’s opposition to the bill to Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint to remake the US government authored by conservatives with ties to Donald Trump. “If Senate Republicans vote no today, and strike IVF protections down yet again, it will be further proof that Project 2025 is alive and well,” Schumer said. “If people want to see how strong Project 2025’s grip is on the GOP, the outcome of today’s IVF vote will be very, very revealing.” In June, Senate Republicans blocked the Right to IVF act, which Schumer is moving to reconsider today. Here’s more on that: Responding to Republican House speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to tomorrow hold a vote on a six-month government funding bill paired with a new federal law against non-citizen voting, the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, implied that the proposal would go nowhere in his chamber. “Speaker Johnson is reportedly going to hold a vote on his six-month CR tomorrow, but the only thing that will accomplish is make clear that he’s running into a dead end – we must have a bipartisan – a bipartisan – plan instead,” Schumer said. The majority leader said he was “heartened” that Johnson’s spending proposal did not contain sweeping budget cuts, but said it was otherwise not acceptable to Democrats. The party opposes the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which requires people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote, though Schumer did not name the bill in his remarks. “I hope it’s a sign that the speaker realizes that these bipartisan funding levels must be part of any solution moving forward. But beyond that, the speaker’s CR [continuing resolution] is too unworkable,” Schumer said. “I urge him to drop his current plan, and to work together to reach a bipartisan agreement with the other leaders – Leader McConnell, Leader Jeffries, and myself, as well as the White House. We do not have time to spare.” In an interview Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis’s show Nueva Network, the vice-president said Latino voters “have the power to determine the outcome of the election”. “Don’t let anyone silence you or tell you your vote doesn’t matter,” Harris said, a nod to the aggressive misinformation campaigns targeting Spanish speakers in the United States. She also touted her economic agenda, saying she would expand the child tax credit and called growing small businesses “one of my passions”. She noted the explosion of Latino and Latina-owned small businesses. Harris also emphasized her personal biography as the daughter of immigrants, raised by a working mother. She said her mother – “a five-foot tall woman with an accent” – arrived in the US alone at 19. She raised two daughters while working as a breast cancer researcher. Kamala Harris answered questions about the economy and immigration on Chiquibaby’s radio show, telling the popular Spanish radio host about the work the Biden administration has done to secure the border but also support immigrants already in the country. “He wants to run on the problem instead of fixing the problem,” she said about Trump during the interview, which was translated from English into Spanish. “His policies would separate families,” she added. “I have already stood, and will always stand, with the belief that we have to keep families together.” The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, announced that he would tomorrow hold a vote on legislation to head off a partial government shutdown that would begin 1 October, and ban non-citizens from voting. The proposal is unlikely to become law, since Senate Democrats and Joe Biden have both said they are opposed to the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which requires people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have nonetheless made the legislation a priority, raising the possibility of a standoff that could bring the government to the brink of a shutdown just weeks before the 5 November presidential election. Here’s what Johnson said about tomorrow’s vote: Congress has an immediate obligation to do two things: responsibly fund the federal government and ensure the security of our elections. Because we owe this to our constituents, we will move forward on Wednesday with a vote on the six-month CR with the Save Act attached. I urge all of my colleagues to do what the overwhelming majority of the people of this country rightfully demand and deserve – prevent non-American citizens from voting in American elections. The speaker’s announcement is something of an about-face, since just last week, he scrapped a vote on the bill after several Republicans objected: In her interview with Hispanic radio host Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis thus far, Kamala Harris has discussed her background and time as a prosecutor, and her plan to lower inflation. Himonidis posed the questions to the vice-president in Spanish, and she is responding in English, with a Spanish translation of her responses playing on the broadcast simultaneously. We expect to hear from Kamala Harris soon, when an interview conducted yesterday with Hispanic radio host Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis airs at 10am. It’s the vice-president’s second interview this year with Himonidis, and first since she became the Democratic nominee for the president. Also dodging questions about Donald Trump’s support for a federal abortion ban is JD Vance, his running mate. He has previously said that the former president would not sign such legislation, but in an interview with NBC News over the weekend, Vance’s response to the question amounts to one big “no comment”: Whether or not he would sign a federal law banning abortion was one of several questions Donald Trump did not directly answer at his debate with Kamala Harris last week. “Would you veto a national abortion ban?” ABC News moderator Linsey Davis asked Trump. The former president equivocated, saying that such a ban would never pass Congress and implying he preferred the issue be decided by states individually – which is the case after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. “She’s not going to get the vote. She can’t get the vote. She won’t even come close to it. So it’s just talk,” Trump said. “The fact is that for years, they wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government, and we did something that everybody said couldn’t be done, and now you have a vote of the people on abortion.” Vice-president Kamala Harris said the policies of her opponent Donald Trump were to blame for the death of a 28-year-old mother in Georgia who was denied lifesaving abortion care under the state’s six-week ban. “These are the consequences of Donald Trump’s actions,” she said in a statement responding to the shocking report in ProPublica. A state medical review committee deemed Thruman’s death “preventable”, and determined that there was a “good chance” she would have survived had she been provided a D&amp;C – a procedure to remove fetal tissue from inside the uterus – earlier, according to ProPublica. As reported, Thurman’s last words to her mother before she died were: “Promise me you’ll take care of my son.” “This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,” said Harris, who has made protecting what’s left of abortion access a prominent feature of her presidential campaign. “This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.” “Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies,” she continued. “And now women are dying.” Harris warned Americans not to trust Trump as he tries to recast himself as a moderate on abortion. As president, he appointed three conservative supreme court justices who were decisive in overturning Roe. As a candidate, Trump has alternately bragged about his role delivering abortion foes the biggest political victory in a half-century, and complaining that Republican extremism on the issue could cost them the election. He has said he would not sign a federal ban on abortion, but his position has shifted. “If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban, and these horrific realities will multiply,” Harris said. “We must pass a law to restore reproductive freedom. When I am President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Lives depend on it.” In an interview with Washington Post conservative columnist Marc Thiessen, Donald Trump reflected on being targeted by two assassins in just under two months. “I try not to think about it,” the former president replied. “But people ask me that question a lot, and I try not to think about it. This was different from the first one, but this one in a certain way was, I mean, the gun was even more violent. And the bullets were from Secret Service, and they caught him. They caught him before anything happened. But it would have happened. I mean, he’s somebody that it would have happened.” He then attempted to steer blame for the attempts on his life to the Democrats, who have called Trump a threat to democracy. Trump’s opponents have used that language because of his continued insistence, without evidence, that he won the 2020 election, and his vows to take revenge on his political opponents if returned to the White House. Here’s more on that: Joe Biden has one public event on his schedule today: a briefing on wildfires at 11.15am ET, which are right now burning swaths of land around southern California. He will later in the day meet behind closed doors with World Bank president Ajay Banga, and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will take questions from reporters at 1.30pm. Here’s more on the fires that continue to burn in the mountains not far from Los Angeles: Steve Witkoff, a businessman and friend of Donald Trump, who was on the golf course on Sunday when Secret Service agents opened fire on suspected gunman Ryan Wesley Routh, has told NBC News more about what he witnessed. He told the network’s Today show: [Trump has] a guy who follows him right behind him, but there’s also people perched next to him. The entire team converged on top of him, except for the snipers. The snipers separated and they came within three yards of me, put the tripods down, and they were aiming right at the spot where the shots had come from. He said he had recognised the “pop” sound as shots right away, and that after the incident Trump checked whether everybody was OK. Witkoff says Trump values the protection officers around him, but added that “mistakes could have been made, and in this case, lives could be lost because of such, because of a mistake”. Later today Kamala Harris will participate in a Philadelphia forum organized by the National Association of Black Journalists. The event has been scheduled after the vice-president did not attend the group’s convention held in Chicago during the summer. Donald Trump did appear at that event in July – with a typically contentious performance during which he repeated lies and attacked Kamala Harris’s racial identity. Some journalists were critical of the organisation for inviting him. Reuters reports that, as Trump did, Harris will face a panel of three journalists in the session. The location is also significant – Pennsylvania is often regarded as a “must win” swing state in order to take the presidency. My colleague Rachel Leingang has this report on misinformation and conspiracy theories that have sprung up in the wake of the apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump while he was playing golf at the weekend: As details of his passion for Ukraine have emerged, some on the far right have claimed Routh may have ties within the US military, with some going even further to say the arrested suspect could have been part of a larger plot. There is no evidence to suggest either – and none of those spreading the rumors have put forth any proof. “What are the odds that this shooter, who spent months fighting in Ukraine, has zero links to anyone in US military or intelligence circles?” Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, wrote on X. “Find them.” Questions surrounding how Routh knew Trump would be golfing that day, given that the round wasn’t on a public schedule, led some to suggest that those tasked with protecting the president could be in on the attempt. The former president praised the Secret Service in the aftermath of the apparent thwarted shooting. Another conspiracy theory claimed Routh appeared in a video for the investment firm BlackRock. The video footage circulated along with the claim shows him at a protest in Ukraine, though the video is unaffiliated with the firm, the company said, adding that Routh “has never been an employee of BlackRock nor has he appeared in any BlackRock ads”. The theory attempted to tie Routh to Thomas Crooks, the shooter in the first assassination attempt against Trump in July, who did appear in a BlackRock commercial when he was a student at Bethel Park high school in Pennsylvania. Read more here: Far-right conspiracies abound after second apparent Trump assassination attempt As far as the election campaign is concerned, this week the Kamala Harris team has its focus on youth turnout to coincide with today’s National Voter Registration Day. In a statement campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said: “The stakes this November couldn’t be higher, and vice-president Harris knows our democracy is stronger when we all vote. We are focused on meeting young Americans where they are to drive home the stakes of this election on the issues they care most about.” During the week Harris’s VP pick Tim Walz and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro will be among those campaigning on campus in battleground states. Recent polling has shown that Harris has a significant lead over Trump in those all important swing states – provided people come out to vote. “When we vote, we win,” said Chávez Rodríguez. The charges facing Ryan Wesley Routh after his apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump at the weekend are possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Yesterday Ronald Rowe Jr, acting director of the Secret Service, confirmed that Routh did not fire any shots, and that he did not have the former president in his line of sight when a Secret Service agent opened fire at him. The New York Times has spoken to Beth Celestini, a former Secret Service agent who previously protected President Barack Obama. She said she had concerns about “reports that the suspect allegedly was in the bushes for 11 hours,” adding: “The Secret Service has protocols where if enacted, this suspect should have been discovered before the incident.” Another retired security agent, Ronald Layton, said to the paper that the question for the agency was: “Was this just luck that you caught this guy, or did you have the appropriate mechanisms in place for these kinds of things on the threat spectrum?” During his appearance on a social media channel to promote a new cryptocurrency venture, former president Donald Trump had some conciliatory words about Joe Biden’s response to an apparent second assassination attempt on Trump in the space of a few weeks. Trump said: He was very nice today, he called up to make sure I was OK, to make sure, [and ask] do I have any suggestions. We do need more people on my detail, because we have 50,000, 60,000 people showing up to events, and, you know, other people don’t have that, but he couldn’t have been nicer. It was in marked contrast to the inflammatory words earlier on Fox News Digital, where he had described Biden and his election opponent Kamala Harris as “the enemy within”. On that occasion Trump said: Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country and they are the ones that are destroying the country – both from the inside and out. These are people that want to destroy our country. It is called the enemy from within. They are the real threat. Suspicious packages were sent to election officials in at least six states on Monday, Associated Press reports, but there was no indication that any of the packages ultimately contained hazardous material. Powder-containing packages were sent to secretaries of state and state election offices in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Tennessee, Wyoming and Oklahoma, officials in those states confirmed. The FBI and US Postal Service were investigating. It marked the second time in the past year that suspicious packages were mailed to election officials in multiple state offices. The packages forced an evacuation in Iowa. A state office building in Topeka, Kansas, was also evacuated due to suspicious mail sent to both the secretary of state and attorney general. Suspicious letters were sent to election offices and government buildings in at least six states last November, including the same building in Kansas that received suspicious mail on Monday. In his press conference on Monday, the acting director of the US Secret Service proposed that the agency needs a radical overhaul in order to meet the challenge of protecting presidents in the current climate. “Coming out of Butler [where Trump was shot at in Pennsylvania], I have ordered a paradigm shift. The Secret Service’s protective methodologies work and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday. [But] we need to get out of a reactive model, and get to a readiness model,” Ronald Rowe Jr said. The Washington Post is among those calling for tighter security around former president Donald Trump. In an editorial overnight the paper wrote: Trump is not receiving the level of protection he did when he was president. This needs to change. Fifty days before a neck-and-neck election, after what are now two attempts on his life, Trump ought to get presidential-level coverage. Protecting Trump as he campaigns is as essential a part of ensuring political stability and continuity of government as one could imagine. Elsewhere in its reporting, the paper says that Trump’s penchant for golf has long been a concern of the security services. It reports: Trump aides and Secret Service agents have long worried about his possible exposure while golfing. The issue, they say, is twofold. He selects locations to golf – his own clubs – that are particularly difficult to secure. And then he follows a highly predictable routine on any given weekend. Bill Gage, a former Secret Service agent, said the armed man probably didn’t need to do “very sophisticated surveillance”. “He just had to sit and wait for Trump to arrive,” he said. “You don’t have to do a lot of guessing to know where he is going to be, and that gives a bad guy time to prepare,” he said. During his call on social media yesterday evening, the former president Donald Trump also had praise for the witness who led to the identification of suspected gunman Ryan Wesley Routh, who was subsequently arrested on I-95. While promoting a new cryptocurrency business venture, Trump said: The civilian did a phenomenal job. A woman. I mean, who would think … how many people would have the brainpower to follow him and take pictures of the back of his truck so that they end up getting, and the key was the license. So they got the license, and after they had the license, you know, there’s all sorts of technology where they can literally pinpoint where this truck is. I never knew something like that existed. And they pinpointed him on the highway. It was quite something, but it worked out well and Secret Service did an excellent job, and they have the man behind bars, and hopefully he’s going to be there for a long time. Dangerous person, very, very dangerous person. Here is how the former president Donald Trump recounted the events of the weekend while speaking on social media on Monday. He told listeners: I was playing golf with some of my friends, it was on a Sunday morning and very peaceful, very beautiful weather, everything was beautiful, it’s a nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me. Everybody just, we got into the carts, and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course. I would have loved to have sank that last putt, but we decided, let’s get out of here. He started shooting at the barrel, started shooting in the bushes. Could only see the barrel. How good is that? Right? Could only see the barrel. Based on that, he started shooting and ran toward the target and was shooting a lot, I mean, those were the shots we heard. The other one never got a shot off. The acting head of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe Jr, has confirmed that the suspected gunman, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, did not fire any shots. Trump was speaking as he launched a new cryptocurrency business, having previous derided cryptocurrencies, saying in 2021: “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam.” Welcome to our rolling coverage of US politics, as the country comes to terms with a second attempted assasination bid aimed at one of the presidential election candidates in the space of a few weeks. Here are the headlines … The suspect in the second apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump in as many months was charged in federal court on Monday morning with two gun-related crimes, as urgent investigations began into how he was able to get so close to the former US president. Cellphone records showed Ryan Wesley Routh camped out near the golf course for about 12 hours, with food, before being confronted by a Secret Service agent. Ronald Rowe Jr, the US Secret Service acting director, said Routh did not fire any shots. Trump added to the already tense atmosphere around the US election campaign by making highly inflammatory remarks, explicitly blaming Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for inciting the attack and calling them “the enemy within”. Biden told reporters on Monday that he did not yet have a full report of the Sunday incident at Trump’s Florida golf course, and was thankful Trump was “OK”. He said: “There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country. Florida governor Ron DeSantis said the state was launching its own investigation."

                    "bodyText": "We are fast approaching two years of the generative AI revolution, sparked by the November 2022 release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. So far it’s been a mixed bag. OpenAI recently announced it had crossed 200 million weekly active users – nothing to be sniffed at, but it got its first 100 million within two months of release. A recent YouGov study found that the inclusion of AI in a product is as likely to turn off a potential purchaser as much as it is to get them to hand over their cash. Nevertheless, money keeps flowing into the sector, and advances keep coming. OpenAI is casting around investors for money to fund future development that would see the company valued at $150 billion. That would put it on a par with Cisco, Shell and McDonalds. And last week, it unveiled its latest model, called o1, which it has touted as a step change in the development of generative AI. The o1 model, previously codenamed Strawberry, is designed to reason through decisions, much in the same way humans do. The latest version of the model underpinning ChatGPT is actually a step backwards when it comes to speed of output and the size of the model, which is smaller for the time being. Think of it as GPT-4.5, rather than the rumoured next big iteration, GPT-5, which is reportedly still in development. Mission: Impossible? While on paper o1 is a damp squib, it does something that Alex had previously highlighted in this newsletter as an issue with LLM-based chatbots, and which he called the “Tom Cruise problem”. The issue was that researchers could ask a question of ChatGPT one way, but when asked a question that directly related to the initial one – for instance, who is Tom Cruise’s mother? (Answer: Mary Lee Pfeiffer), then being asked who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son? (Answer: Tom Cruise) – it would balk. Ask o1 that pair of questions and it aces it. It even provides traces of how it gets to the answer – which OpenAI has cannily, and inaccurately because AI models don’t have a brain, called “thoughts”. (If you want to know why anthropomorphising AI models is an issue, check out this story I wrote in February.) When asked the second question, o1 “thought” for four seconds, including tracing out the family connections and confirming details. So far, so good. OpenAI says o1 can reason. Many are less sure about such a declarative statement like that, but let’s let them have it for the purposes of marketing. That would mean a significant shift in how you can use generative AI: rather than regurgitating facts from its training data, or producing answers it statistically reckons is most likely to please users, it could consider information and respond. “Could”, however, is the key word. We are still largely in the dark about how these things work – and “we” includes the developers of such tools. OpenAI has said this ability to reason is a big thing – the company has even trotted out a questionable claim that o1 is its most dangerous model yet (see here for how that’s sometimes more marketing spiel than anything). Those who have tried probing the limits of the o1 model seem to agree with their point about the reasoning, but less so with the danger part. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain! Well, sort of. Because the probing can only go so far. To try and understand the chain of thought process that underpins o1 – if you want a good primer, Simon Willison is ever-dependable – users wanting to look under the hood have been trying to get a little more detail on exactly what o1’s “thought” process is. The information users are currently shown is a brief summary of each step in the chain of thought. And because of that, they’ve been asking the model itself about how it comes up with its answers – though they have also received emails from OpenAI asking them to stop, otherwise their accounts will be suspended. It all means that we’re left somewhat in the dark. This looks like a transformative step change in the world of AI, and something that could turn the tool from one whose output you have to look at with a side-eye of suspicion to a must-use. What’s particularly interesting is that OpenAI’s dominance has effectively squeezed out coverage of any and all competitors of late. Mistral, the highly-touted French competitor, released its first multimodal model last week. The Pixtral 12B model adds image recognition to text generation. It should have gained huge plaudits. But OpenAI and o1 sucked up all the oxygen. Still, it all means the AI train keeps on rolling, and it’s starting to finally live up to its promise. Whether those who tried ChatGPT in its early days and found it lacking can be persuaded to come back to try the newer whizz-bang models is another question.

How do we preserve our digital history in a world where third-party services like the Internet Archive are being attacked and sued? EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who has been an outspoken big tech critic, is leaving his role over a spat with Ursula von der Leyen. Data centre emissions could be 662% higher than publicly claimed. The White House has strongly condemned Elon Musk for tweeting “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala” in response to an X user asking “Why they want to kill Donald Trump?” Meanwhile, here’s what 24 hours in Musk’s mind looks like. TikTok started its fight for survival in court yesterday."

                    "bodyText": "It started with an argument over a blanket. “I’m a visual neuroscientist, and my wife, Dr Marissé Masis-Solano, is an ophthalmologist,” says Dr Patrick Mineault, designer of the viral web app ismy.blue. “We have this argument about a blanket in our house. I think it’s unambiguously green and she thinks it’s unambiguously blue.” Mineault, also a programmer, was fiddling with new AI-assisted coding tools, so he designed a simple color discrimination test. If you navigate to ismy.blue, you’ll see the screen populated with a color and will be prompted to select whether you think it’s green or blue. The shades get more similar until the site tells you where on the spectrum you perceive green and blue in comparison with others who have taken the test. “I added this feature, which shows you the distribution, and that really clicked with people,” says Mineault. “‘Do we see the same colors?’ is a question philosophers and scientists – everyone really – have asked themselves for thousands of years. People’s perceptions are ineffable, and it’s interesting to think that we have different views.” Apparently, my blue-green boundary is “bluer” than 78% of others, meaning my green is blue to most people. How can that be true? Our brains are hard-wired to distinguish colors via retinal cells called cones, according to Julie Harris, professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, who studies human visual processing. But how do we do more complex things like giving them names or recognising them from memory? “Higher-level processing in terms of our ability to do things like name colors is much less clear,” says Harris, and could involve both cognition and prior experience. The science may be tricky, but ismy.blue’s intuitive interface and visualised results were instantly engaging, leading to over 1.5m visits since its launch in early August. “I’m not super surprised that it struck a chord because people want to understand how others see the world,” says Mineault. Clearly there’s a widespread fascination with perception and subjectivity. Many of us remember how The Dress went viral in 2015 because it looked white and gold to some and blue and black to others. Most differences in color perception are physiological, like color blindness, which affects one in 10 men and one in 100 women. Others, however, may be connected to aspects of culture or language. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, popularised in the movie Arrival, suggests that language shapes the way we think, and even how we perceive the world. In the 1930s, Benjamin Lee Whorf argued that the world consisted of “a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions organised … largely by the linguistic systems of our minds”, pointing to, for instance, the Inuits’ multiple words for “snow” as an example of differences in cultural perceptions. Although this theory continues to be hotly debated throughout linguistics, psychology and philosophy, language does inform how we communicate ideas. There’s no word for “blue” in ancient Greek, for example, which is why Homer described stormy seas as “wine-dark” in The Odyssey. By contrast, Russian has distinct words for light blue and dark blue. However, recent research suggests a greater vocabulary may only be beneficial for remembering colors and not for perceiving them. Before you fight online about whether a particular shade is aqua or cyan, it’s important to note that ismy.blue’s results have limitations. The slightest variation in viewing conditions influences color perception, which is why vision researchers take such care when designing experiments. Factors like the model of your phone or computer, its age, display settings, ambient light sources, time of day and even which color is presented first in the test will all play a role in your responses. Night modes in particular increase the redness of a device’s screen, causing blues to appear greener. To see if this was influencing test results, Mineault separated the data into two groups: before or after 6pm. The effect was immediately apparent, especially on devices with built-in night modes. So what’s the point of ismy.blue if it’s so variable? In the end, it’s just entertainment. But if you’d like results with a little more equivalence, Mineault suggests doing the exercise with others on the same device, so that “everybody’s in the same lighting and the same place”. Although Mineault doesn’t have any plans to publish the results, ismy.blue is a great example of citizen participation in science. For instance, since 2010, tens of thousands of people have played the online puzzle game Fold.it, which helped scientists at the University of Washington crack notoriously difficult protein folding problems. The mobile app Sea Hero Quest, which aimed to learn more about navigation in people with dementia, had more than 4 million players before the experiment ended in 2017. Science is historically insular, focusing almost exclusively on the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic). Opening research up to the public better equips scientists to understand the amazing diversity of human experience. “Most vision scientists have always gone ‘we’re all the same’, [but] there’s all sorts of interesting evidence showing that vision can be different across cultures,” says Harris. Citizen science also does wonders for the relationship between an often-stuffy academic community and the wider public. “It’s a lot of work to communicate something to someone who’s not in your subspecialty, but I think that’s where the innovation happens,” says Mineault. One question remains, though: what color is the blanket? “We’ve taken the test a bunch of times,” says Mineault. “As soon as there’s a little green in there, I call it green”; his wife sees blue. The solution? Maybe just buy a new one. Ben Thompson is a behavioural neuroscientist, writer and artist"

                    "bodyText": "Big tech has made some big claims about greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. But as the rise of artificial intelligence creates ever bigger energy demands, it’s getting hard for the industry to hide the true costs of the data centers powering the tech revolution. According to a Guardian analysis, from 2020 to 2022 the real emissions from the “in-house” or company-owned data centers of Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple are probably about 662% – or 7.62 times – higher than officially reported. Amazon is the largest emitter of the big five tech companies by a mile – the emissions of the second-largest emitter, Apple, were less than half of Amazon’s in 2022. However, Amazon has been kept out of the calculation above because its differing business model makes it difficult to isolate data center-specific emissions figures for the company. As energy demands for these data centers grow, many are worried that carbon emissions will, too. The International Energy Agency stated that data centers already accounted for 1% to 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2022 – and that was before the AI boom began with ChatGPT’s launch at the end of that year. AI is far more energy-intensive on data centers than typical cloud-based applications. According to Goldman Sachs, a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, and data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030. Goldman competitor Morgan Stanley’s research has made similar findings, projecting data center emissions globally to accumulate to 2.5bn metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. In the meantime, all five tech companies have claimed carbon neutrality, though Google dropped the label last year as it stepped up its carbon accounting standards. Amazon is the most recent company to do so, claiming in July that it met its goal seven years early, and that it had implemented a gross emissions cut of 3%. “It’s down to creative accounting,” explained a representative from Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an advocacy group composed of current Amazon employees who are dissatisfied with their employer’s action on climate. “Amazon – despite all the PR and propaganda that you’re seeing about their solar farms, about their electric vans – is expanding its fossil fuel use, whether it’s in data centers or whether it’s in diesel trucks.” A misguided metric The most important tools in this “creative accounting” when it comes to data centers are renewable energy certificates, or Recs. These are certificates that a company purchases to show it is buying renewable energy-generated electricity to match a portion of its electricity consumption – the catch, though, is that the renewable energy in question doesn’t need to be consumed by a company’s facilities. Rather, the site of production can be anywhere from one town over to an ocean away. Recs are used to calculate “market-based” emissions, or the official emissions figures used by the firms. When Recs and offsets are left out of the equation, we get “location-based emissions” – the actual emissions generated from the area where the data is being processed. The trend in those emissions is worrying. If these five companies were one country, the sum of their “location-based” emissions in 2022 would rank them as the 33rd highest-emitting country, behind the Philippines and above Algeria. Many data center industry experts also recognize that location-based metrics are more honest than the official, market-based numbers reported. “Location-based [accounting] gives an accurate picture of the emissions associated with the energy that’s actually being consumed to run the data center. And Uptime’s view is that it’s the right metric,” said Jay Dietrich, the research director of sustainability at Uptime Institute, a leading data center advisory and research organization. Nevertheless, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, a carbon accounting oversight body, allows Recs to be used in official reporting, though the extent to which they should be allowed remains controversial between tech companies and has led to a lobbying battle over GHG Protocol’s rule-making process between two factions. On one side there is the Emissions First Partnership, spearheaded by Amazon and Meta. It aims to keep Recs in the accounting process regardless of their geographic origins. In practice, this is only a slightly looser interpretation of what GHG Protocol already permits. The opposing faction, headed by Google and Microsoft, argues that there needs to be time-based and location-based matching of renewable production and energy consumption for data centers. Google calls this its 24/7 goal, or its goal to have all of its facilities run on renewable energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week by 2030. Microsoft calls it its 100/100/0 goal, or its goal to have all its facilities running on 100% carbon-free energy 100% of the time, making zero carbon-based energy purchases by 2030. Google has already phased out its Rec use and Microsoft aims to do the same with low-quality “unbundled” (non location-specific) Recs by 2030. Academics and carbon management industry leaders alike are also against the GHG Protocol’s permissiveness on Recs. In an open letter from 2015, more than 50 such individuals argued that “it should be a bedrock principle of GHG accounting that no company be allowed to report a reduction in its GHG footprint for an action that results in no change in overall GHG emissions. Yet this is precisely what can happen under the guidance given the contractual/Rec-based reporting method.” To GHG Protocol’s credit, the organization does ask companies to report location-based figures alongside their Rec-based figures. Despite that, no company includes both location-based and market-based metrics for all three subcategories of emissions in the bodies of their annual environmental reports. In fact, location-based numbers are only directly reported (that is, not hidden in third-party assurance statements or in footnotes) by two companies – Google and Meta. And those two firms only include those figures for one subtype of emissions: scope 2, or the indirect emissions companies cause by purchasing energy from utilities and large-scale generators. In-house data centers Scope 2 is the category that includes the majority of the emissions that come from in-house data center operations, as it concerns the emissions associated with purchased energy – mainly, electricity. Data centers should also make up a majority of overall scope 2 emissions for each company except Amazon, given that the other sources of scope 2 emissions for these companies stem from the electricity consumed by firms’ offices and retail spaces – operations that are relatively small and not carbon-intensive. Amazon has one other carbon-intensive business vertical to account for in its scope 2 emissions: its warehouses and e-commerce logistics. For the firms that give data center-specific data – Meta and Microsoft – this holds true: data centers made up 100% of Meta’s market-based (official) scope 2 emissions and 97.4% of its location-based emissions. For Microsoft, those numbers were 97.4% and 95.6%, respectively. The huge differences in location-based and official scope 2 emissions numbers showcase just how carbon intensive data centers really are, and how deceptive firms’ official emissions numbers can be. Meta, for example, reports its official scope 2 emissions for 2022 as 273 metric tons CO2 equivalent – all of that attributable to data centers. Under the location-based accounting system, that number jumps to more than 3.8m metric tons of CO2 equivalent for data centers alone – a more than 19,000 times increase. A similar result can be seen with Microsoft. The firm reported its official data center-related emissions for 2022 as 280,782 metric tons CO2 equivalent. Under a location-based accounting method, that number jumps to 6.1m metric tons CO2 equivalent. That’s a nearly 22 times increase. While Meta’s reporting gap is more egregious, both firms’ location-based emissions are higher because they undercount their data center emissions specifically, with 97.4% of the gap between Meta’s location-based and official scope 2 number in 2022 being unreported data center-related emissions, and 95.55% of Microsoft’s. Specific data center-related emissions numbers aren’t available for the rest of the firms. However, given that Google and Apple have similar scope 2 business models to Meta and Microsoft, it is likely that the multiple on how much higher their location-based data center emissions are would be similar to the multiple on how much higher their overall location-based scope 2 emissions are. In total, the sum of location-based emissions in this category between 2020 and 2022 was at least 275% higher (or 3.75 times) than the sum of their official figures. Amazon did not provide the Guardian with location-based scope 2 figures for 2020 and 2021, so its official (and probably much lower) numbers were used for this calculation for those years. Third-party data centers Big tech companies also rent a large portion of their data center capacity from third-party data center operators (or “colocation” data centers). According to the Synergy Research Group, large tech companies (or “hyperscalers”) represented 37% of worldwide data center capacity in 2022, with half of that capacity coming through third-party contracts. While this group includes companies other than Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple, it gives an idea of the extent of these firms’ activities with third-party data centers. Those emissions should theoretically fall under scope 3, all emissions a firm is responsible for that can’t be attributed to the fuel or electricity it consumes. When it comes to a big tech firm’s operations, this would encapsulate everything from the manufacturing processes of the hardware it sells (like the iPhone or Kindle) to the emissions from employees’ cars during their commutes to the office. When it comes to data centers, scope 3 emissions include the carbon emitted from the construction of in-house data centers, as well as the carbon emitted during the manufacturing process of the equipment used inside those in-house data centers. It may also include those emissions as well as the electricity-related emissions of third-party data centers that are partnered with. However, whether or not these emissions are fully included in reports is almost impossible to prove. “Scope 3 emissions are hugely uncertain,” said Dietrich. “This area is a mess just in terms of accounting.” According to Dietrich, some third-party data center operators put their energy-related emissions in their own scope 2 reporting, so those who rent from them can put those emissions into their scope 3. Other third-party data center operators put energy-related emissions into their scope 3 emissions, expecting their tenants to report those emissions in their own scope 2 reporting. Additionally, all firms use market-based metrics for these scope 3 numbers, which means third-party data center emissions are also undercounted in official figures. Of the firms that report their location-based scope 3 emissions in the footnotes, only Apple has a large gap between its official scope 3 figure and its location-based scope 3 figure. This is the only sizable reporting gap for a firm that is not data center-related – the majority of Apple’s scope 3 gap is due to Recs being applied towards emissions associated with the manufacturing of hardware (such as the iPhone). Apple does not include transmission and distribution losses or third-party cloud contracts in its location-based scope 3. It only includes those figures in its market-based numbers, under which its third party cloud contracts report zero emissions (offset by Recs). Therefore in both of Apple’s total emissions figures – location-based and market-based – the actual emissions associated with their third party data center contracts are nowhere to be found.” 2025 and beyond Even though big tech hides these emissions, they are due to keep rising. Data centers’ electricity demand is projected to double by 2030 due to the additional load that artificial intelligence poses, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Google and Microsoft both blamed AI for their recent upticks in market-based emissions. “The relative contribution of AI computing loads to Google’s data centers, as I understood it when I left [in 2022], was relatively modest,” said Chris Taylor, current CEO of utility storage firm Gridstor and former site lead for Google’s data center energy strategy unit. “Two years ago, [AI] was not the main thing that we were worried about, at least on the energy team.” Taylor explained that most of the growth that he saw in data centers while at Google was attributable to growth in Google Cloud, as most enterprises were moving their IT tasks to the firm’s cloud servers. Whether today’s power grids can withstand the growing energy demands of AI is uncertain. One industry leader – Marc Ganzi, the CEO of DigitalBridge, a private equity firm that owns two of the world’s largest third-party data center operators – has gone as far as to say that the data center sector may run out of power within the next two years. And as grid interconnection backlogs continue to pile up worldwide, it may be nearly impossible for even the most well intentioned of companies to get new renewable energy production capacity online in time to meet that demand. • This article was amended on 18 September 2024. Apple contacted the Guardian after publication to share that the firm only did partial audits for its location-based scope 3 figure. A previous version of this article erroneously claimed that the gap in Apple’s location-based scope 3 figure was data center-related."

                    "bodyText": "The Murdoch family succession drama enters a new phase in a Reno, Nevada, courtroom this week when patriarch Rupert Murdoch will probably argue that plans by three of his children to potentially change the business model of the news-communications empire will damage the interests of Fox Corp shareholders. Sadly for followers of the intense and labyrinthine Murdoch family drama – one that partly inspired the fictional HBO series Succession and many of its plot lines – the arguments and testimony stemming from the bitter feud will not be in public view. Last week, the Nevada judge David Hardy ruled against a petition by a coalition of media companies to unseal the case – obscurely named Doe 1 Trust, PR23-00813 – writing: “A family trust like the one at issue in this case, even when it is a stockholder in publicly traded companies, is essentially a private legal arrangement, as the applicable sealing statues recognize.” Some details will probably leak, as they did in July when the New York Times obtained documents relating to Murdoch’s petition to change, or “decant”, an irrevocable trust set up to pass controlling stakes in the Fox Corp empire to the four children from his first two marriages – Prudence, James, Elizabeth and Lachlan – after his death. Murdoch wants to give all voting power to his oldest son, Lachlan. If his plans are accepted, Murdoch’s other adult children will lose their voting power. The key thing for most observers is that Lachlan is the most politically aligned with his rightwing father while the other siblings have expressed reservations about the direction of the companies, especially during the rise and fall – and possible rise again – of Donald Trump. Murdoch must convince the Nevada probate commissioner, Edmund Gorman, that empowering Fox Corporation’s executive chair and CEO, Lachlan, to run the company without interference from the other siblings and maintain the properties’ conservative tilt will maintain News Corp’s commercial value for all his heirs, including two daughters – Chloe and Grace – he shares with his third wife, Wendi Deng. How the scope of those arguments, including the potential for argument on the relative merits of the siblings in terms of business acumen, are unknown. Murdoch, 93, announced a year ago that he was stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp and the newspaper company News Corp, and handing the reins to Lachlan. That came three years after he got a $71bn top-dollar price from Disney for entertainment-focused 21st Century Fox, with the four mainline beneficiaries receiving $1bn each from the proceeds of the sale. In terms of business savvy, Lachlan has in his corner the streaming service Tubi, which Fox purchased for $440m in 2020 and turned down an unsolicited $2bn offer three years later. Last week, Lachlan discussed a new sports bundler, Venu, a partnership with Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Fox, that he said was “designed entirely for the cord-cutters and cord-nevers”. James Murdoch, who has donated to progressive political groups, resigned in 2020 from the News Corp board, citing disagreements over editorial content. He has also criticized the US media for amplifying disinformation about the 2020 election results which Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed were “rigged” – a claim boosted by Fox News pundits. The New York-based James is an angel investor, and holds board seats in three companies including Tesla, the AI-focused Rebellion Defense and the publishing firm AWA. He recently added his name to a letter of 88 business leaders endorsing Kamala Harris for president. If the Nevada case turns on ensuring the future value of the family business then the supporting argument centers on the political direction of Fox and News Corp, which includes Fox News, Fox Nation, the Times of London, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. In the case of Fox News, a perennial bugbear of the political left, Murdoch’s argument would appear straightforward: its success and power relies on being rightwing. According to its own estimates, Fox News delivers 1.3 million viewers across daytime programming , beating CNN by 176% and MSNBC by 58% with total viewers. During prime time, when cable news stations switch over to opinion broadcasting, Fox News averaged 2 million viewers, or a 267% advantage over CNN and a 77% advantage over MSNBC. In terms of revenue, Fox News’ $3bn was double that of CNN and two-thirds more than MSNBC’s, with profits approximately mirroring that breakdown, in 2022. But all cable news networks are looking at the same threat to revenue from a declining linear TV market due to ageing audiences and a dwindling number of cable TV subscribers, the so-called cable cutters. According to Robert Thompson, media professor emeritus at Syracuse University, Murdoch’s reason for amending the Murdoch family trust is to protect the value of Fox News and to argue that to change its political direction would be to compromise that value. “It’s a clever argument,” Thompson says. “CNN had the pie to itself before the Fox News and MSNBC came in in the 1990s, and Fox figured out early in the game that they didn’t need even 4 million people watching and they’d be No 1 with a million and a half people watching each night.” That meant figuring out how to get a certain slice of the population to watch not just breaking news, the CNN model, but to keep those numbers up by appealing to a small but dedicated base audience. MSNBC plays by the same rules, albeit from the other side of the political spectrum. “The change would be giving away a successful model to one less successful,” Thompson says. In seeking to have the case unsealed, a coalition of media organisations argued that the level of secrecy “does not pass constitutional muster” and should be open to the public because its outcome could affect thousands of jobs, media consumers and the political landscape. Failing to persuade commissioner Gorman, news outlets have been left to pick at the legal effort, dubbed Project Harmony, via stray rulings. Those suggest that one thing unites the fractious Murdochs: blocking media access to the court hearing. That, of course, is laden with ironies, not least that the newspaper side of the business has paid out millions to settle claims of press intrusion and that in any other case Murdoch media properties would be fighting to obtain access. Certainly, the fight between a dominant, empire-building father and his divided offspring is a classic media trope. Just look at the success of Succession, a critical and audience smash hit that explored just such themes through its fictional Roy family. It is also a classic case of an argument that could only happen to a billionaire family. “Rupert Murdoch made enough money that his kids could comfortably revolt against him,” says Thompson. “If you are completely set up in terms of financial stability, you can have ideas other than simply protecting the empire, and you don’t need Dr Freud to tell you that other elements get put into play beyond bottom-line financial results.” He adds: “It takes a lot of privilege to be able to tell Dad to go take a hike.”"

                    "bodyText": "A friend recently shared a comment someone had made about her online. Sophie was a middle-aged, never-was influencer, in this stranger’s estimation, who exploited her children and alienated everyone she met. As I debated whether “liking” the post would read as support or broad agreement, I noticed a strange watermark. The vicious words had been generated not by a bitter stranger, but an AI roast app. My demented friend had asked for this. Who would volunteer to be insulted? A wave of apps such as Roastai.app, Roastedby.ai, Roastik.com and er, Monica.im suggest the answer is loads of us. Every day, people upload selfies to the Reddit page r/RoastMe, begging to be taken down a peg or two hundred. “You look like a series of circles stacked on top of one another,” the users exult. “Why does your forehead start at the back of your head?” There is a cruel craft to it. One sedentary rapper recently got called “The Notorious BMI”, while someone else, who I don’t even think had strabismus, was accused of having “mortgage eyes – one fixed, one variable.” At its harder end, roasting is full of brutal, hard to defend stuff. It takes us straight into the debate around comedy and offence, a frontline of the culture war. What are we allowed to joke about? What are the rules? How do we know we are not laughing the charred laughter of hate? The fact is some people will always want to play with the really hot stuff, the radioactive topics, the language that burns. “People love being roasted,” confirmed Sophie (terrible mother). But why? In her memoir A Widow’s Story, Joyce Carol Oates reveals a surprising aspect of her grief: she misses the feeling of being teased. Impertinence can be a sign of intimacy. The same psychology underpins roasting. A play on “toasting”, the term was coined at a New York member’s club in the 40s, and popularised by Dean Martin’s Celebrity Roasts with his Rat Pack pals. To be roasted is to be truly seen – and celebrated anyway. The question remains: why roast ourselves? Perhaps to get ahead of the joke. I think about Rebel Wilson’s character in Pitch Perfect. “I call myself Fat Amy so twig bitches like you don’t do it behind my back” is a perfect line. But can we always de-fang the snake? And should we? I admit I find some of Sammy Davis Jr’s self-loathing comic “bits” hard to listen to. The most multi-talented member of the Rat Pack, it was only because of Sinatra’s intercession that Davis was allowed to stay in the hotels they played. Owning our pain doesn’t necessarily transform it. Being roasted in the group chat is now a treasured pastime among my friends. I wonder if Britain has adopted the Americanism because our own word “banter” had grown too toxic? Too readily wheeled out as a defence by boors, who confuse being loud with being funny? A shame, as banter simply means repartee. (No one calls it that, because nobody wants to sound like a Musketeer.) Comedy is perverse and slippery, like the human spirit. I remember another friend, who served in Afghanistan during an actual war, telling me about her army call sign. She chose Pork Chop. As in “Hello Pork Chop, this is Bravo 21; message over.” After a while, the lads in her unit started calling her Cupcake instead. Horrifically sexist; yet I laughed out loud when she told me. Hold off the big red button, let me unpack this laughter of hate. A laugh can rely on specificity of tone and the context of a relationship. Setting matters, plus my sense of her intentions. In this case, something about her defiance of gender norms and its flat ineffectiveness. Other relationships matter – whether her colleagues were roasting her to include, or exclude. There’s also a subtle energy feedback loop. My friend, who is certainly no cupcake, is telling me this because she’s anticipating I’ll find it funny, which makes her find it funny, too. Comedy – even the blunt stuff – is sophisticated. Unfortunately, the internet is superb at stripping away context and nuance. It’s heartbreaking that humour has fallen into the hands of those least qualified to handle it. On one side, people who need everything to be an argument, and on the other, bigots. Neither of these are my people and I refuse to pick a team. Is comedy moral? No, it’s more important than that. Humour is both deeply subjective as well as a social safety valve against dogmatic thinking. Putting rules around what’s funny is as useless as trying to explain charm with a protractor and set square. But just because anything can be funny, doesn’t mean everything is funny. Needless to say, I instantly downloaded a roast app and aimed it at myself. Do me! It came back with some crap gags making weak fun of the fact I don’t post frequently on X or Instagram, where it harvests its data. Too boring to print. AI is bad at roasting not because it’s evil, or offensive, but because it’s unfunny. AI is incapable of relationship, or meaningful celebration. It could have called me a skinny-fat race traitor with Peter Pan syndrome, but it just doesn’t know me like that. Anyway, they say you shouldn’t dissect comedy, so instead I’m off to call social services on Sophie. Now that’s what I call banter!"

                    "bodyText": "Mark Zuckberg’s Meta is to go ahead with controversial plans to use millions of UK Facebook and Instagram posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) technology, in a practice that is effectively outlawed under EU privacy laws. Meta said it had “engaged positively” with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) over the plan, after it paused similar proposals in June in the UK and EU. The pause came after the ICO warned tech firms to respect the privacy of users when building generative AI. On Friday, the ICO made it clear it has not provided regulatory approval for the plan, but will instead monitor the experiment after Meta agreed changes to its approach. These include making it easier for users to opt out of allowing their posts to be processed for AI. Privacy campaigners, including the Open Rights Group (ORG) and None of Your Business (NOYB), are alarmed at the plans. When the plans were first mooted ORG accused Meta of “turning all of us into involuntary (and unpaid) test subjects for their experiments”. Alongside NOYB it urged the ICO and the EU to block them. The plans remain on hold in Europe. Meta has accused the EU of holding back the development of AI by refusing to allow EU citizens’ posts to be used for AI training. But on Friday, Meta confirmed that for UK users of Facebook and Instagram it will resume plans to use publicly shared posts to train AI models. It will not use private messages or any content from those under 18, Meta said. In a statement, Meta said: “This means that our generative AI models will reflect British culture, history and idiom, and that UK companies and institutions will be able to utilise the latest technology. We’re building AI at Meta to reflect the diverse communities around the world and we look forward to launching it in more countries and languages later this year.” Stephen Almond, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk, said: “We have been clear that any organisation using its users’ information to train generative AI models should be transparent about how people’s data is being used. “Organisations should put effective safeguards in place before they start using personal data for model training, including providing a clear and simple route for users to object to the processing.” He added: “The ICO has not provided regulatory approval for the processing and it is for Meta to ensure and demonstrate ongoing compliance.”"

                    "headline": "Wikipedia is facing an existential crisis. Can gen Z save it?",
                    "bodyText": "Established in 2001, Wikipedia is an “old man” by internet standards. But the role it plays in our collective knowledge of the world remains astonishing. Content from the free internet encyclopedia appears in everything from high-school term papers and pub trivia questions to search engine summaries and voice assistants. Tools like Google’s AI Overviews and ChatGPT rely heavily on Wikipedia, although they rarely credit the site in their responses. And therein lies the problem: as Wikipedia’s visibility diminishes, reduced to mere training data for AI applications, it also loses prominence in the minds of readers and potential contributors. When someone notices a topic that is poorly described on Wikipedia, they might feel motivated to correct it. But this can-do spirit goes away when the error comes through an AI summary, where the source of the information isn’t clear. In Katowice, Poland, at last month’s annual Wikimania conference – an event that feels a bit like an international summit of librarians crossed with Comic-Con – many of the speakers highlighted how Wikipedia faces an existential threat of fading into obscurity or disrepair. But there was also talk of a solution that may help secure Wikipedia’s future, or at least prevent its premature demise: recruiting more younger editors from generation Z and raising their awareness of how widely Wikipedia content is used across the internet. Wikipedia operates on a model of unpaid and independent volunteers who create, update and maintain the content. Casual editors may make minor stylistic edits to a page, while others devote substantial time to creating full-fledged articles. A significant number of Wikipedia contributors are already gen Z; according to a 2022 survey, about 20% of Wikipedia editors are between the ages of 18 and 24. Although this is roughly reflective of the global population, there is a clear desire to increase this percentage. As a tech writer, and in my research of Wikipedia for my novel The Editors, I have often heard the same handful of issues that dissuade the younger generation from joining the cause. First and foremost, the smartphone is gen Z’s preferred internet access device, but it’s not an easy tool for editing Wikipedia. Even the savviest digital natives find it frustrating to edit the encyclopedia with a small screen. There are exceptions. Hannah Clover, a 22-year-old Canadian, was the youngest ever winner of “Wikimedian of the Year” at last month’s Wikimania. She also happens to be a rare breed: a highly prolific Wikipedian who has made more than 75% of her edits using mobile devices. A lot of those were edits she made on the go, while commuting on the bus or during shift breaks at her former job at McDonald’s. For Clover, adding to the global encyclopedia helped provide a sense of purpose. “Serving ice-cream to people isn’t really that much of a world-changing endeavour,” she told me. Clover has recommended improvements to the Wikipedia mobile app, including the ability to create new articles and a visual editor that doesn’t require any coding skills. Another obstacle to attracting gen Z contributors is that today’s Wikipedia is simply more established. Steven Pruitt is a Wikipedia legend, with the largest number of edits made to English Wikipedia, at more than 5m. Now 40 years old, Pruitt said that when he first started editing 20 years ago, the project felt like uncharted territory: he had significant freedom to create new articles. Today, with so many pages already in existence, there are fewer opportunities to add new content. That means gen Z must approach Wikipedia not as an exciting wild west, but as an institution they can gradually improve. Yet it’s harder for new editors to find their way in. Previous generations often began by making small edits, like fixing typos or spotting vandalism, but nowadays many of these tasks are handled by automated tools. Without clear entry points, new editors may dive into editing more contentious articles, where a single misstep could trigger harsh feedback. Experienced Wikipedians aren’t known for being nicey-nice: if an old-timer posts curt, pointed feedback on a new user’s talk page (where editors discuss improvements to articles), the public nature of the critique can be shameful enough to discourage the newcomer from continuing as a regular volunteer. Like others in her cohort, Clover was born after Wikipedia was founded, so her mental image of an encyclopedia is shaped more by Wikipedia than by shelves of leather-bound Encyclopaedia Britannicas. This generational difference extends to the norms of communication. Clover and her peers often engage on chat platforms like Discord, while some older Wikipedians prefer to keep discussions confined to Wikipedia’s talk pages, where conversations are more focused and less social. Clover believes that offering more opportunities for social interaction is crucial for building a sense of community and shared purpose among young editors. As she put it: “When you’re young, you can feel like everything you’re doing is going into a massive void.” While the different generations may eventually find common ground, the future relationship between human editors and AI remains uncertain. Will AI eventually replace human volunteers? Let’s hope not. Compiling an encyclopedia requires making judgments that are best understood by humans, who know the social context. Fortunately, gen Z doesn’t seem inclined to immediately surrender Wikipedia to AI. During an online debate last year about whether Wikipedia editors should incorporate chatbot-generated content, several young contributors urged caution, pointing out how large language models often produce errors and fail to cite sources accurately. And beyond AI’s shortcomings, there is a great human benefit to young people’s increased participation in the world’s most important knowledge platform. As a generation that is overall very cynical about media and institutions, contributing to Wikipedia allows them to channel their concerns into something constructive. Gen Z may still have plenty of criticisms of old institutions like Wikipedia, but at least they will have got involved.

                    "bodyText": "As our live news coverage winds down for the day, here’s a look at what’s been keeping us busy this Wednesday: As plans to establish social media age bans forge ahead, PM Anthony Albanese told parliament “regulating technologies is difficult”. Labor will close the Aukus loophole on nuclear waste. Opposition leader Peter Dutton has promised to “turbocharge” the mining industry should he win office at the next election. Labor’s hate speech bill will not criminalise vilification, such as inciting hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is looking into allegations against parliamentarians. Jason Clare announced he would be introducing legislation to establish a National Student Ombudsman. Independent senator Fatima Payman has given a Senate speech against the government’s proposed social media age limit. Independent MP Zoe Daniel is also not a fan of the plan, which she says is the “equivalent of announcing a recipe without producing a cake”. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek told the resources sector she will “carefully weigh the evidence” on mine approvals. Teenagers who vape are at least five times more likely to go on to try smoking than those who have never vaped, new research has found. Buckingham Palace and the Australian government have released details about King Charles and Queen Camilla’s royal visit in October. Finally, more on the man who “flipped the bird” towards politicians from the public chamber. Thank you for joining us – we’ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning. Labor ‘has one path left’ through the Senate, say Greens Following Peter Dutton’s remarks at a fossil fuel mining lobbying event today in Canberra, the Albanese government “has one path left” through the Senate to protect the environment, the Greens say. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, the Greens’ spokesperson for the environment, said the nature positive bills have been stuck in political limbo between polluters and environmentalists. Today we heard a diatribe of destruction from Peter Dutton. Dutton’s demands for more fossil fuels, more pollution and more destruction make the choice for the Albanese government clear: work with the Greens and the crossbench to protect the environment or capitulate to Gina Rinehart and the big polluters. The Greens are prepared to work with the government for a nature-positive outcome. The ball is in the prime minister’s court. The mystery man who allegedly “flipped the bird” at politicians in Tuesday’s question time was not signed in by a politician, the Speaker’s office has confirmed. On Tuesday the independent MP Zali Steggall told parliament a “gentleman in jeans, black T-shirt, overweight and bald” had made the gesture to the chamber. Steggall claimed the man had looked to the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, in support. A Western Australian One Nation politician posted a video of a man, referred to as “Shane” in a popular Canberra pub on Tuesday night, saying: “I would like to raise a finger to the prime minister of this great nation one more time. So, please put your drinks down and vote Albo 1”. The man raised both hands and gestured with his raised middle fingers. The video showed others had joined in. Guardian Australia asked the Speaker’s office whether the man Steggall referred to had been signed in by a politician. A spokesperson for the Speaker’s office said the man was not. Littleproud told ABC on Tuesday he had only signed one person into Parliament House that day – the Nationals’ Bullwinkel candidate, Mia Davies – and said Steggall was “looking for attention”. Read more: Government’s hate speech bill won’t address ‘rising tide of public homophobia and transphobia’, says Alastair Lawrie And again on the topic of the hate speech bill, Alastair Lawrie, director of policy and advocacy at the Justice and Equity Centre, said: We are concerned by reports that the government’s promised hate speech bill will not contain the broad-based civil vilification provisions which are needed by LGBTIQ Australians, people of minority faiths, people with disability and others. A bill that focuses narrowly on acts and threats of violence would be rarely used in practice, and would not adequately address the serious challenges being experienced by these communities, such as the rising tide of public homophobia and transphobia over the past 18 months. The Justice and Equity Centre continues to support the expansion of civil vilification protections under commonwealth law, to ensure that, in addition to existing laws on racial vilification, they also cover religious belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, and disability at a minimum. Rodney Croome calls for incitement to hatred against LGBTIQA people to be prohibited Continuing on the topic of the hate speech bill, Just Equal spokesperson Rodney Croome has responded: The government’s plan to amend the criminal code to prohibit incitement to violence against LGBTIQA people needs to occur because we are one of the few groups not already protected. But with rising hate against our community, especially transgender people, our top priority is to prohibit vilification against LGBTIQA people in the Sex Discrimination Act. Prohibiting incitement to violence but not incitement to hatred is like curing the symptoms rather than preventing the illness. Anti-LGBTIQA vilification has already been prohibited in Tasmania, Queensland, the ACT, NT and partially in NSW, so the federal government has no excuses. In May the Albanese government promised to create a hate speech bill that would protect people from vilification and hate speech. The Age has reported, and Guardian Australia has independently confirmed, that the bill will not criminalise vilification, such as inciting hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule. The bill will in fact set a higher threshold of only criminalising incitement to acts of violence or threats of violence, aligning sexuality and gender with existing protections for race. Advocates noted that on Tuesday the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in question time: The government will be introducing legislation this week to create new criminal offences and strengthen protections against hate crimes. These offences will protect the community, including the LGBTQIA+ community and other targeted groups, from the threat of force or violence and from those who would urge violence against them, which we know is only too real. This was a distance short of the original commitment. Cold fronts moving across Australia to bring lower temperatures over coming days Temperatures are set to drop across much of Australia as two cold fronts make their way across parts of the country over the next few days, the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast: Smoky in Sydney amid hazard-reduction burns in city’s north The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has warned Sydney residents that smoke from hazard-reduction burns is currently affecting the region. The smoke is forecast to subside over the course of tomorrow. Jacinta Price alleges ‘opportunists’ claiming Indigenous heritage to block resources projects Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has claimed “opportunists” are making “false claims” to membership of Indigenous groups to scuttle resource projects seeking environmental approval, Guardian Australia’s Paul Karp and Karen Middleton write. The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians made the claim on Wednesday while defending a Coalition plan to designate which Indigenous groups would need to be consulted by project proponents, as revealed by the shadow resources minister, Susan McDonald, at a Minerals Week event. Read more below: Zoe Daniel skeptical of social media ban for children Thank you, as ever, Amy Remeikis. Let’s get on with the remainder of the news on this Wednesday afternoon. Social media bans for children are forging ahead at breakneck speed, but not everyone is on board. Speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, the independent MP Zoe Daniel said the policy developments felt like “the equivalent of announcing a recipe without producing a cake”. She told the ABC: I’m not convinced that the systems exist for it to be effective. There are a lot of concerns about potential privacy risks, and also young people don’t want it, and it might be difficult to enforce … I think there are other things that we can do which would be better policy, more effective and less simplistic. Instead, she suggested that social media companies should be playing a bigger part in the protecting the online safety of children. If you speak to most experts, they would argue that platforms should be taking responsibility for their systems. They also should be making those systems transparent so that we can [ask] ‘What mitigation factors do you have in place to make sure that harm is prevented?’ If you created a system where the platforms are legislated to do no harm, you might not need to verify age. And on that wide-ranging note, I will hand you over to Daisy Dumas who will take you through the evening. We have one more day of a joint sitting left, and you can feel the house MPs starting to get itchy feet, while their Senate colleagues stare longingly at an exit many won’t get until the end of next week. With the government looking to push through as much legislation to the Senate as it can before the Senate-only week, Thursday is looking pretty busy. We will be back with you early on Thursday morning. Until then, as always – take care of you. ‘Aukus is fundamental’ to Australia’s defence against China threat: Joyce Barnaby Joyce finished by saying China’s increased engagement with Pacific island countries was aimed at “encirclement” of Australia: If things turn against us, we’re in a world of strife, because we have one big thing in our pocket – that we have a military agreement with the United States of America. Joyce questioned whether “the good mums and dads” in the United States would “happily send their family members over to be killed on behalf of Australia” because they “might have other ideas about that”. He said that was why the Aukus deal was so important to Australia: I call to the Australian people and to all to just understand history. Don’t understand my politics. Disregard me completely. Dislike me as much as you like, but like a history book – really have a good read of that. And as you have a read of that, think of all the things that you cherish about Australia, your particular causes that you want to pursue and want to sustain. The only way they’ll sustain that is if you have a formidable capacity to defend your nation, and we have a formidable gap to fill* before we have the capacity to do that. And Aukus is fundamental in that process. *Joyce was a senior member of the nine-year-long Coalition government that first was inclined to pick a Japanese submarine model, before signing a deal with the French, before tearing that up to pursue Aukus in 2021. Joyce claims Greta Thunberg supports nuclear energy and says Australia must ‘take the leap’ Let’s bring you some more from that *wide-ranging* speech from Barnaby Joyce. The Coalition frontbencher told the federation chamber: We’ve got to get out of this naivety that we are smarter than everywhere else in the world – we’re not. And we’ve got to also take the leap. For goodness sake, if Greta Thunberg can support nuclear energy, then I don’t think it’s a huge leap for us to. I mean, it just stands to reason. This would be the same Thunberg that Joyce previously teed off at. In a speech in 2022, Joyce criticised Australian school students who were “challenging in the court the government’s right to approve the expansion of coalmines”. Joyce said at that time: If they are looking to their future maybe they should consider how they will pay for defending it from the most egregious form of aggression that may be forced on them in their lifetime. Will they stand behind their views when Greta Thunberg’s “blah blah blah” oration fails to defend their rights and liberties? For the record, Thunberg previously said it would be a “mistake” for Germany to shut down its existing nuclear plants in favour of reopening coal plants, telling a German TV program in October 2022: I personally think it’s a very bad idea to focus on coal when [nuclear] is already in place. In 2021, Joyce said he accepted that “humans have an influence on climate” but he refused to say whether he accepted key findings of the IPCC’s latest global summary of climate science, declaring he won’t be “berated” or participate in a “kangaroo court”. Here is some of how Mike Bowers saw question time, or alternatively, how Mike Bowers captured part of a millennial classic. The ACT government has called for a meeting of federal, state and territory environment and agriculture ministers about preparedness for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in Australian wildlife. The territory’s environment minister, Rebecca Vassarotti, from the ACT Greens, said local ecosystems were at heightened risk through spring due to the arrival of migratory birds and it was not clear if Australia was properly prepared to respond if the disease was introduced. She said given the catastrophic effects the highly pathogenic strain has had on wildlife globally “we must ensure we are fully prepared to respond”: I have written to the federal environment and agriculture ministers requesting that the Australian government arrange a joint meeting with all state and territory governments to strengthen and align our preparations for a potential H5N1 avian influenza incursion. Given the unique nature of H5N1, it is unclear whether or not existing national biosecurity response and funding mechanisms will be triggered, or be adequate to support states and territories to properly respond. Earlier this week the federal government held a national training exercise to test planned responses if the strain were to arrive on Australian shores and affect native wildlife. The agriculture minister, Julie Collins, said the government was very concerned about the impact the disease could have on native species and the broader environment and economy. The situation remains dynamic and we are committed to provide an agile inter-governmental, industry and community response to protect Australian industry, trade and wildlife. In a very wide-ranging parliamentary speech, the Coalition frontbencher Barnaby Joyce has warned that “history pulsates in and out” and said a failure to have a defence force would mean “you don’t have to worry about climate change any more … coz you don’t have a nation any more”. Joyce, the former deputy prime minster and now shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, backed the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan during a federation chamber debate today. During his speech on the naval nuclear regulator legislation, Joyce said that “if you have a desire to protect the liberties and freedoms from everything from gender, sexual preference, environment, everything that we have, then you better be able to defend it”. He contended that totalitarianism was on the rise and democracy was on the wane around Australia: Democracy is becoming smaller, and we have to understand how history works. If we deny history, we are total – not only are we fools, but we’re also dangerous. History pulsates in and out, power pulsates in and out, democracy pulsates in and out, and totalitarianism and the rise of one power to subjugate another to take over areas is just the nature of history. It’s the nature of humankind. So we need to become as powerful as possible, as quickly as possible. It is absolutely indelible in what this nation has to do. We need a defence force, because without a defence force, you don’t have to worry about Indigenous policy, because there will be no Indigenous policy, coz you won’t have a nation. You don’t have to worry about climate change any more. That policy is over coz you don’t have a nation any more. You don’t have to worry about your house coz that no longer exists. Forget about your super – it’s irrelevant. It’s gone. Most importantly, the freedom for your children is also gone. They will live in a vassal state at the best, as supplicants and subject to an iron boot at worst. Now people say that’s excessive. It’s not – that’s just the history of the world. That’s just how it works, and we have a massive step to take, and we better do it in a big, big hurry. Jason Clare defends international student cap The education minister, Jason Clare, has told reporters he has “nothing but respect” for David Lloyd and hasn’t listened to his National Press Club address yet after the Labor party was accused by the Universities Australia chair of placing the sector at the centre of a national debate for “political rather than policy purposes”. Lloyd condemned both major parties today over the government’s proposed international student cap, which he said would act as a “sledgehammer” to universities. Clare said what he was doing with the caps was returning international student numbers for universities back to last year’s numbers. That’s all. And I’ve made the point on a number of occasions, that as a government we’re committed to returning migration levels in Australia to pre-pandemic levels. Our universities don’t run the migration system in Australia, a government should. This will help us to do that. But also to make sure that we’re managing what is a really important asset for Australia. Clare said it was his “intent” for the caps to be permanent, adding the soon-to-be-established Australian Tertiary Education Commission would act as a steward to the system. There are some universities that are educating about the same number of Aussies today as they were a decade ago, but many more international students … International education is important [but] we’ve got to protect its integrity, we’ve got to protect community support for it. Independent senator Fatima Payman has given a Senate speech against the government’s proposed social media age limit Payman addressed the speech to gen Z and gen Alpha and so said she would be using their slang: To the sigmas of Australia, I say that this goofy air government have been capping not just now, but for a long time. A few of you may remember when they said there’ll be no Fanum tax under the government I lead. They’re capaholics. They’re also yapaholics. They yap non-stop about how their cost of living measures are changing lives for all Australians – just put the fries in the bag, lil bro! They tell us that they’re locked in on improving the housing situation in this country. They must have brain rot from watching too much Kai Cenat and forgot about their plans to ban social media for kids under 14. If that becomes law, you can forgor skull emoji all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a dub with the bros on board. Chat, is this prime minister serious? Even though he’s the prime minister of Australia, sometimes it feels like he’s the CEO of Ohio. I would be taking a L if I did not mention the opps who want to cut WA, gas and services, tax. The decision voters will be making in a few months time will be between a mid government, a dog water opposition, or a crossbench that will mock both of them. Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope when you do it will be in a more goated Australia for a government with more aura. Skibidi. If you don’t understand it, it’s probably a sign that you are not the target audience, and maybe should also invest in a retinol. And even if you don’t understand it, it is still more coherent than a Bob Katter or Barnaby Joyce speech. No cap. It was another question time session in search of a landing. After exhausting non-issues in the last parliament session, the Coalition is back on the economy – but the very particular niche of the government fighting the RBA. The tagline of the questions – why is the Albanese Labor government fighting the Reserve bank while Australian families are going backwards? – might appeal to the press gallery hall monitors, but probably won’t have much sway out in voter land. And, in the end, the Coalition undermined its own message by giving the example of a couple who are being smashed by interest rates – which, given it was Jim Chalmers saying that interest rates were “smashing the economy” which kicked off this whole thing, seems a strange way to make the opposite point. The most interesting thing of that question time was Anthony Albanese’s answer to Zali Steggall on the government’s proposed partial gambling ban. It was the strongest defence he has given so far: Anthony Albanese then reads out from a handwritten card he received this morning while waiting for Australia’s Paralympic team to arrive home from Paris. Hi, my name is Rafferty Stevens, but you should call me Raff. I’m 12 years old, and I play wheelchair basketball and tennis. I’m ranked No 43 in the world for tennis, and I am in the state performance program for wheelchair basketball. My wish is to represent Australia in wheelchair basketball at the Brisbane 2032 Paralympic Games. Thank you for putting money towards Paralympic sport. I promise to train hard at tennis and basketball so I reach my goal. Kind regards, Rafferty Stevens. So to Raff and Alicia, your mum, we collectively are very confident that you’ll get there in 2032 and for those Paralympians who arrived home today, that is the sort of inspiration that you have. Your conduct and your performance has changed lives, changed the life of this young man. It’s a great thing. There is a rousing hear hear from both sides of the chamber. Interest rates smashing the economy and the treasurer fighting the RBA LNP MP Henry Pike asks: Jess and Russell from Alex Hills have told me ‘our interest rates skyrocketed. We now have to find an additional $500 every week. The government seems indifferent to whether we can put food on our table.’ With falling disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting households, why is the Albanese Labor government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families are going backwards? I think you know what the answer is, but this question just deserves a moment – it is about interest rates, which are set against the RBA’s cash rate, and not set by the government. So Jess and Russell’s issue is with interest rates. The second part of the question asks why the government is fighting the Reserve Bank, which is a reference to Jim Chalmers having said that interest rates were “smashing the economy”. So Pike just asked a question about a couple who were being smashed by interest rate rises and then asked the treasurer why the government was fighting the RBA. Anika Wells gives update on funding for Paralympic athletes Sports minister Anika Wells paid tribute to Australia’s Paralympians and then gave a funding update: The Albanese government’s commitment will shift the balance of sport funding in this country, from 85% able bodied and 15% people with disability, to 75% and 25%. This is part of a record government spend in sport overall of almost $500 million. Over the next two years. We also invested an additional $20 million to help our Olympic and Paralympic athletes qualify for Paris and we provided Australia’s para-athletes with the same financial incentives for winning medals at the Paris Games. As our Olympians, our Paralympian gold medallists received $20,000, our silver medallists received $15,000, and our bronze medallists received $10,000. Because we recognise high performance sport is exactly that. No matter which body you are performing high performance sport in, from playground to podium, from junior pathways to Paris, from backyards to Brisbane 2032, the Albanese government is backing our Australian athletes here to coach them. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is looking into allegations of corrupt conduct against six current or former parliamentarians, new figures show. The federal integrity body, which opened its doors in July 2023, released its latest weekly figures on Wednesday revealing 26 of the 29 corruption investigations it launched last financial year were still under way. Among those being investigated are six former or current parliamentarians and three former or current parliamentary staff. Other top officials being looked at include seven current or former senior executive officials and eight law enforcement officials. Once a referral is made to the Nacc, it undergoes a preliminary investigation to determine whether there is any potential corruption. If the watchdog determines there is potential corrupt conduct, it can launch a solo or joint investigation into the matter with other relevant agencies. The Nacc said: The above categories do not capture all the corruption investigations and some investigations fall under multiple categories, but they provide a flavour of the commission’s activities. In considering them, it is important to remember that most corruption investigations do not ultimately result in a finding of corrupt conduct. Anne Aly continues: The assessment criteria remained broadly similar across all CCF rounds for sustainability funding, but there were some changes in the grant guidelines reflecting lessons learned on reviews of previous grant grant rounds and those lessons and the feedback that we got on those was that the round should be open to applications from priority areas as well as services that had been successful in previous rounds, as well as vulnerable and disadvantaged cohorts. Now, I appreciate that it can be disappointing for services when they don’t get when they’re not successful in competitive grants. I can really appreciate that and I can appreciate the difficulty for families and communities, and I can appreciate the way in which we can continue to discuss this, particularly for your electorate as well, for the member for Indi, I’d encourage the member to relay to those services that there is a special circumstances round that they may be eligible to apply for, and encourage them to see whether or not that is a viable option. Anne Aly questioned on ‘vital childcare services’ closing due to lack of funding Helen Haines asks the minister for early childhood education, Anne Aly: Out of school hours and care services at small rural schools across my electorate face imminent closure after sustainability funding was cut. If these services close, parents won’t be able to work in a cost of living crisis. It is clear there is not enough money in the community childcare fund. Will the minister stand by while vital childcare services close due to a lack of government funding? Aly: I thank the member for Indi for her question and in the constructive way in which she has engaged in relation to early childhood education in her electorate and indeed on issues on early childhood education right across Australia. Now the community childcare fund that the member alluded to supports early childhood education and care services to open and to stay open. And just by way of background, it’s a more than $600 million programme currently supporting around 700 services across Australia, and 85% of those services are in regional and remote areas. The recently announced CCF, or Community Childcare Fund, round for more than 380 services received offers of Office of Sustainability support to help them remain open and 90 services received offers of capital support. That’s to help them undertake important modification or expansion of their work. And that includes five services in the member’s electorate that received sustainability funding and two services that received capital funding the CCF round for grant opportunity was a competitive grant. It’s a competitive grant process run by the department, and decisions are made at arm’s length from the minister. I make no apologies for that. In the interests of transparency, transparency in the interests of accountability and in the interests of integrity, it is important that these competitive grants are run in a way in which selection is based on merit. The guidelines for the grant opportunity were published on Grant connect. Deputy opposition leader told to leave chamber under 94A Andrew Giles takes a dixer and the Coalition starts oohhing and ahhing and Milton Dick has to give a general warning. The question is: How is the Albanese Labor government supporting Australians to gain the skills that are in demand while easing cost-of-living pressures? What approach to skills has the government rejected? Giles is making his way through the question and gets to the compare and contrast part and then Sussan Ley decides to jump up: I appreciate that this minister hasn’t been on his feet for quite some time, but the question to him from his own side did not invite a compare and contrast, nor did it invite him to consider the policies of the opposition. Someone makes the quip that Labor is “very sensitive over there”. But then it seems everyone is so busy congratulating themselves on being the cleverest in the room, they didn’t actually listen to the question. Tony Burke: I just raise two things. One, that was a deliberate abuse of a point of order, and two, it was done after you’d given a general warning. Milton Dick takes the sort of deep breath your divorced friend who has just returned from a three month eat-love-pray sojourn gives when made to face their ex again and says: The deputy leader of the opposition didn’t hear the question, because in the question it said what approaches were rejected? [Labor starts ooohhhing and ahhhing.] I don’t need sound effects on my right either. So I’m willing to give everyone a fair go when it comes to points of order, if anyone jumps up but not to be taken advantage of, it’s not appropriate. It’s not how this parliament is going to work, and it’s not how this parliament has worked. So there’s consequences for actions. The deputy leader will leave the chamber under 94A. Clare O’Neil says something and Milton Dick goes to pull her up by calling her her old title – the minister for home affairs, before correcting it to housing and homelessness. Paul Karp hears someone in the opposition say “we can’t tell either”. Coalition persists with inflation theme The Nationals MP for Nicholls, Sam Birrell, asks the next Angus Taylor question (Taylor is still in the chamber, but it looks like the Coalition tactics team wants to share around the love): Over the last two years Australian households have experienced the largest fall in disposable incomes in the OECD, that is more than the UK, the US, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. With full disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting households, why is the Albanese Labor government fighting the Reserve Bank of Australia as families are going backwards? I think you know what the answer is. You have heard it a million times today. Jim Chalmers: I say respectfully to the honourable member if we agree that Australians are doing it tough, and I think that we do, it is a bit bizarre that those opposite want people to earn less. They want to get less help with the cost of living and they did want everyone to get a tax cut. They don’t want every household to get energy bill relief and they presided over a decade of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression. Those opposite have got to make up their mind, they have to decide whether they agree that people are doing it tough, and we understand that people are doing it especially tough. And they have to decide whether they want to be part of the problem or part of the solution. Part of the problem would be if they swung the axe at Medicare and pensions and all the things that they’re planning in the $350 billion in cuts, that would make things worse rather than better. Mehreen Faruqi on international student cap: ‘come back with an education bill, not a migration policy’ The Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, has backed comments made at the National Press Club by the Universities Australia chair accusing Labor of treating the sector like “political footballs” as a result of the international student cap. In a Guardian essential poll this week, a majority of respondents (53%) said the Albanese government’s plan to cap international student enrolments in tertiary education at 270,000 in 2025 had got the number “about right”, while (37%) said this was still “too high” and just 10% said it was “too low”. But Faruqi said Labor’s “hot mess of a policy” was nothing more than a “political game” to win border wars before the election. Both Albanese and Dutton are singing from the same migration songbook. This time international students are the targets and higher education the collateral damage in their race to the bottom. The prime minister knows how to backflip - it’s time to backflip on these reckless and illogical caps, go back to the drawing board and come back with an education bill, not a migration policy. Albanese: “I do not believe the state has an absolute right to determine the behaviour of individuals across the board.” Anthony Albanese finishes with: I think that would have an impact and an intrusion into people’s personal liberties which is not appropriate in my view. I respect that some people have a different view [but] I do not believe the state has an absolute right to determine the behaviour of individuals across the board. What I do believe though is we have a responsibility to restrict the damage that harmful advertising can have. I think we need to act and part of what we’re looking at when the ads are available, [that] is a major factor here. I do not think that there should be advertising aimed at children, there should not be any advertising during children’s programs, I think we need to make sure that adults can be adults but children can be children. And the connection as well between sport and gambling needs to be broken because sport should be enjoyed for what it is, sport. That is an important focus of why we are undertaking these consultations. Zali Steggall gets one of the crossbench questions and asks Anthony Albanese: To the prime minister. In your previous answer you talked of giving parents peace of mind and protecting children. But you are being selective with which harm you address. Young Australians are being targeted and groomed to highly addictive harmful gambling by constant advertising, are you ignoring the vast majority of Australians calling to fully ban gambling advertising as soon as possible? Albanese says no and then gives the strongest defence of the government’s proposed partial ban we have heard so far. I thank the member for her question and the answer is no, we’re not. My government has done more to act against harmful gambling that any government in Australian history. More in just two years by undertaking action, we know when we look at where the harmful gambling comes from, almost 70% of that harmful gambling is poker machines. More than around about 15%, the figure at the top of my head, comes from lotteries and lottery tickets as well. I am yet to see anyone stand up in this place [to] advocate banning completely all advertising of lottery and lottery tickets. We know that gambling advertising – when it comes to sport, too prevalent – we know that it can be really annoying apart from anything else when you are watching sport and we know that we want to take an approach which is responsible, that makes a difference as well. That is why we have undertaken serious consultation with everyone from Tim Costello, the antigambling lobby, who don’t want advertising stopped, many of them want gambling stopped. And that is the truth of their position and that is a legitimate position for them to take but it is not one that I have, in terms of stopping all racing for example, stopping all gambling right across the board. RBA governors, past and present Sussan Ley gets to ask a question: The ABC’s Jacob Greber has reported a senior Labor figure described RBA governor Michele Bullock as a nutter and the RBA in general as barbarians and weirdos. Has the treasurer spoken to Wayne Swan or Paul Keating in relation to these matters? With falling disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting households, why is the Albanese Labor government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families go backwards? Milton Dick says he thinks the first part of the question is more of an opinion, but he’ll allow it. Jim Chalmers: I’m happy to answer all of it. First of all I have not spoken to those former treasurers for more than a couple of weeks now and I know that those opposite are going around and pretending and getting people to write somehow there has been some [issues] with the comments that former treasurers have made about these matters. I know that they are perfectly fine with former treasurer Howard, former treasurer Costello, former treasurer Frydenberg out there in the public debate but if you’re a former Labor treasurer you have no business being involved in it. I know that. I’ve not spoken to either of those two guys in the commentary of their views in at least a couple of weeks. As regards to the other part of the question, the question about the comments reported by Jacob Greber who is out there in the gallery, as of this yesterday or the day before and I said I completely disagree with those comments. I completely and utterly disagree with the comments that were made to Jacob in this regard, I think I already make that clear and if I have not, I make it clear right now. I have a respectful working relationship with Governor Bullock and with her colleagues. As Governor Bullock has made it clear on a number of occasions we work well together, we have the same objective, different responsibilities. Because of our combined efforts we have seen inflation halve since we came into office. That is important, that is the main game. The primary fight against inflation. At the same time as we roll out cost of living help, get the budget in better nick and invest in the Future Made in Australia and in housing and skills, so I don’t agree with those comments, I haven’t discussed them with anyone, but I’ve answered this question before and I’m happy to answer it again. ‘Sticky high inflation’ and ‘Australian families going backwards’ Angus Taylor takes another run at Jim Chalmers with a variation of the same question we have heard all question time. This is an old tactic, designed to put a minister under pressure or at least get under their skin. And while it can work, Chalmers has never really succumbed to it – because he’ll happily say the same thing day in and day out, while also slamming Angus Taylor, because that remains one of his favourite pasttimes in the parliament. Taylor: Independent economist Chris Richardson says governments are throwing a lot of money at the symptoms of the cost-of-living crisis, but that worsens the cause of it. With falling disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting Australian households, why is this government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families are going backwards? Chalmers: In terms of people doing it tough, I think it speaks volumes that when the home affairs minister was talking about a $16,000 pay cut, those opposite were chuckling about it. Doesn’t that just go to the core of their approach and the difference between their approach and our approach? He is told to stick to the question. Chalmers: We will do more to acknowledge that people are doing it tough. We are acting on it, helping with the cost of living and getting wages moving again. We are getting real wages moving again as a consequence of our efforts. Now, if the commentary that the shadow treasurer read out is true now, imagine how much worse it will be if we were still running the huge deficits that we inherited from those opposite? They were running massive deficits when we came to office and we [changed] two of those huge deficits into two substantial surpluses. And the Reserve Bank governor has made it really clear that those surpluses are helping in the fight against inflation. And when we came to office, the most recent budget from those opposite had zero savings in it, we found almost $80m in savings and put that in our three budgets. When those opposite were spending almost all of the upward revision to revenue from a stronger labour market and stronger commodity prices, we banked almost all of it, we do that deliberately. That has been an important part of our fiscal strategy, which has helped us clean up a lot of the mess that we inherited from those opposite, and because of our efforts we are saving tens of billions of dollars in interest repayments, which is also helping the budget, making room for us to provide cost-of-living help and invest in housing and energy and skills, and in A Future Made in Australia, and those are important objectives. When I am asked about government spending, I think we are in the third year now of a three-year parliamentary term. It is long past time, if those opposite think there is $315bn too much spending in the budget, then it is incumbent on them to come clean on their cuts, and to tell us where those cuts will come from. Tony Burke on wages and the labour-hire loophole Tony Burke takes a dixer on wages, which he can answer as the minister responsible (Murray Watt is in the Senate) and it’s an area he is very comfortable traversing (especially compared with home affairs and immigration, which are his portfolios now). Burke: A whole lot of us, when we exercise our right to disconnect on Thursday afternoon, a whole lot of us will fly home. When [Coalition MPs] fly home are you going to tell the Qantas flight attendants what you are intending to do to their pay? Because for a long time the labour hire loophole, and it was legal and used by Qantas and other companies, the pay differences were not small. So you have enterprise agreement that had been negotiated and then you could use a labour hire company, on this occasion it was also run by Qantas, and undercut the rates that were agreed to. Now, for the flight attendants you might be seeing on Thursday afternoon, if they are employed directly, it is $68,500 a year they are on. If they are employed through the labour hire company, through the labour hire loophole, it is $52,000 that is the award rate. A $16,000 pay cut! It is good enough for them to help you onto the plane, good enough for them to serve you a drink while you are on the plane, it should be good enough to say they won’t get a pay cut, and yet, when you commit to abolishing same job, same pay, you commit to cut people’s pay at the exact time that people are under pressure, the answer is not for people to be paid less. Coalition continues attack over inflation and interest rates Angus Taylor is back to make Jim Chalmers’ day: Last week the treasurer accused the RBA of smashing the economy. Former RBA board member Warwick McKibbin said ‘for the treasurer to come out and say this is the Reserve Bank’s fault, I don’t think a serious economist in the country would agree with that’. With falling disposable income and sticky inflation hurting households, why is this government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families are going backwards? Chalmers: Thank you for the very similar question I answered comprehensively a moment ago. I will repeat ... Let me go through it once again (there is a crack here about the shadow treasurer taking longer to understand things here, but I miss the exact phrase). First of all, any objective observer of the economy understands the combination of global economic uncertainty persistent inflation and higher interest rates are slowing our economy, in our case quite considerably, that is a point I have been since at least June of this year. That is the first point. Second point, when it comes to taking responsibility for our part in the fight against inflation, I do, I said that not just earlier today but I have said that on a number of occasions and I mean it. I take responsibility for the fact that when we came to office and there were differences as far as the eye could see and $1 trillion in Liberal debt, not enough to show for it, that we took important steps to try and clean up the mess that we inherited. We turned those two big Liberal deficits into Labor surpluses. We found savings, we tried spending restraint because we knew that if we got the budget in better condition, we would help the governor and the Reserve Bank in their fight against inflation, and Governor Bullock has acknowledged we are helping in the fight against inflation. I make the same point again. I repeat the point that I made earlier – the worst thing any responsible decision-maker in our economy should be contemplating right now is $315 billion in secret cuts. And the reason why they haven’t come clean on that is because it is a recipe for recession. Theirs is a recipe for a recession …. Taylor has a point of order on relevance, because Chalmers wasn’t asked about alternative policies, “particularly alternative approaches that don’t exist”. Chalmers returns to his answer, which expands on what he says is the recession risk of a Coalition government. Anthony Albanese takes the next dixer on the social media age verification policy: The solutions aren’t simple. That’s why we need to have trials and make sure that we get these things right, regulating technologies is difficult. We’re entering a new frontier but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try. We must. This is a complex problem. Young people can find ways to get around rules. But just because the occasional young person might get access to alcohol doesn’t mean we say we won’t worry about restricting alcohol to over-18s, we’ll just let it all rip. We actually regulate and we organise as a society, we make decisions about protecting people. And that is what this is about. Bob Katter asks a question but, as is tradition, we cannot tell you what it was about. We can tell you that the crossbench MPs who sit behind him – Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink and Elizabeth Watson-Brown, are now masters at the “holding back the bemused expression while Katter speaks” expression. The dixers (questions written by the government tactics team and given to government backbenchers to ask to government ministers) have all been about the social media age verification policy announced yesterday. Today’s message from the government – it is not about telling parents what to do, but helping them with additional tools. Hmmmkay. Milton Dick brings out his Dugald voice to tell the chamber to get it together after a bunch of interjections and Garth Hamilton gets booted for not picking up what Dugald is putting down. There is far too much noise in the chamber. We’re not having a repeat of yesterday. I’m asking all members to show restraint today to improve the tone of the chamber. To cease interjections. The member for Groom is interjecting through that answer. He will leave the chamber under 94A. There are consequences for actions in this place far too much noise this week. Today things will be quiet. Treasurer questioned on inflation and interest rates Angus Taylor gets the second question (must be trying to get him in before he gets thrown out for interjections). Last week the treasurer accused the RBA of smashing the economy. BlackRock’s head of Australia fixed income Craig Vardy has said it was because the treasurer ‘needs a diversion from the key part the government is playing by not reining in spending to help bring inflation down’. With falling disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting households, why is this government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families go backwards? Chalmers seems happy to see Taylor back across from him: If the shadow treasurer doesn’t think that the combination of global economic uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates is slowing the economy, it’s no wonder that nobody takes him seriously. Those are facts borne out in the national accounts. Self-evident by any objective observer of our economy who knows that higher interest rates are slowing our economy. It’s a point I’ve been making since at least June of this year. Now I’m asked whether I take responsibility for our part in the fight against inflation and I do. And as the prime minister said a moment ago in the year of our election inflation was 7.8%. And now it’s got a 3 in front of it. Inflation has halved on our watch. In that regard I do take responsibility for the fact that we’ve turned two huge Liberal deficits into two big Labor surpluses. The fact we have designed our cost of living help to take the edge off some of the price pressures in our economy. I take responsibility for banking almost all of the upward revision to revenue. I take responsibility of working with my great colleagues in the other place to find almost $80 billion in savings. I take responsibility for the fact that Governor Bullock has said our two surpluses are helping in the fight against inflation. I’ve made it very clear that we have a role to play in the fight against inflation and that’s one of the reasons why we are making welcome and encouraging progress and because we’re getting inflation down, and because we’re getting wages up, real wages are growing again in our economy after they were falling substantially when we came to office. Peter Dutton opens the questions today: My question is to the prime minister. Core inflation in Australia is higher than every major advanced economy. It is higher than the US, the UK, Canada, the euro area, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and New Zealand, Prime Minister. With falling disposable income and sticky high inflation hurting households, why is the Albanese government fighting the Reserve Bank while Australian families go backwards? Anthony Albanese: I’m asked about international comparisons. And I can’t do better than quote Michele Bullock, the RBA governor, who said this on August 6, 2024. “We didn’t go as high as the Fed. Our interest rates are lower I would observe than the Bank of England, the US Fed, Bank of New Zealand, all have interest rates up above 5%. Bank of Canada did too. We don’t”. Peak headline inflation hit on an annual basis at 7.8% in Australia. That was before we came into government. It is now half. We have halved inflation from where it was in 2022. In the UK, 11.1%. In New Zealand, 7.3%. Canada, 8.1%. The US, 9.9%. The current cash rate here in Australia is 4.35%. In the UK it’s 5%. In New Zealand, it’s 5.25%. And in the US it is 5.5%. The cash rate under the leader of the opposition as assistant treasurer was 6.75%. 6.75%. Michael Sukkar yells some things (timeless statement). Albanese: The member for Deakin thinks it was funny that his leader was once assistant treasurer. Because the bizarre joke is that those people came in here when inflation was double what it was, what it is today, when we came into office. When employment has seen some 980,000 jobs [added]. When we see wages, wages increasing rather than decreasing. Which is what those opposite wanted to see. When we see the workforce participation rate at record levels. When we see the gender pay gap at a record low of 11.5%. And when we see the economy, of course under us, experiencing modest growth. Modest growth but growth nonetheless. Those opposite, if they had their way and implemented the more than $300 billion of cuts, we would have seen a devastation in our economy had we followed what they want to do. We are not sure how it is possible, but those three minutes went for about two months. Peter Dutton also gives a shout out to … Qantas: Qantas do an amazing job in bringing back our Paralympians and Olympians and have done so since the end of the second world war and 1968 since the Paralympics. Seems like there might be a little bit of damage control going on after Bridget McKenzie freelanced on Coalition policy when it came to airlines. (McKenzie called for divestment powers, naming Qantas specifically and saying it might be made to sell off Jetstar, before she was made to walk her own comments back.) Question time is delayed while Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton pay credit to Australia’s Paralympian team. Albanese: To every member of the Australian team, I simply say you’ve done yourself proud. You’ve done your families proud. But you’ve done our nation proud as well. Australia is so proud of you. Congratulations. And welcome home. Mehreen Faruqi denounces Israeli airstrikes on al-Mawasi ‘humanitarian zone’ The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, began her speech to the Senate with denunciation of the Israeli airstrikes on al-Mawasi “humanitarian zone” in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday: ‘We were all asleep. Then suddenly everything was turned upside down. The colour of the sky changed … the sky was filled with screams, crying and the sound of ambulances.’ That was how an eyewitness described Israel’s latest massacre in Gaza, committed yesterday. There have been just too many. We can’t bear to look, but we should never look away. Families were sheltering in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone and they were burned alive, buried in the sand. The bombing was so severe it left a deep crater ... and melted bodies. At least 19 people were slaughtered, and the death toll is expected to climb. That is on top of the 41,000 Palestinians already slaughtered. Dr Elspeth Pitt, a Scottish emergency doctor working at a field hospital run by the British medical humanitarian organisation UK-Med, said the clinic “received 26 patients, mostly women and children” and “had to do several amputations and dealt with shrapnel injuries and burns”, the Guardian has reported. The Israeli military said it had “struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area in Khan Younis”. Israel has said it is targeting Hamas, not the Palestinian people. Deputy Greens leader offers solidarity to Melbourne weapons expo protesters In a speech to the Senate, the deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, has offered her solidarity to “the thousands protesting in Melbourne today to say no to the business of war”. Vision from the scene shows at least one protester being arrested and Victoria police using pepper spray on others at a rally outside the Land Forces exposition at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre this morning, as my colleagues report here. Faruqi told the Senate: My solidarity is with the thousands protesting in Melbourne today to say no to the business of war and to say no to Australia being complicit in genocide, because that is where this Labor government has shamefully positioned this country. Labor tries to distract and deflect, but there is no deflection. So long as we have defence contracts with Israeli weapons companies, the Labor government is complicit in genocide, so long as you refuse to impose sanctions on Israel, this Labor government is complicit in genocide, and there are no excuses for inaction. The UK has suspended some arms sales to Israel. Canada today is halting more arms sales to Israel. What will it take for the Labor government to take action against the apartheid state of Israel? Your hollow words and pointless phone calls are nothing but a smokescreen, and everyone can see through it. Do something. Take action. The Australian government has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza since December and has repeatedly called on Israel to comply with international law, but has so far resisted calls to describe Israel’s conduct as genocide and to impose sanctions against members of the Israeli government. South Africa has brought a case before the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel denies the claim and the ICJ has yet to rule on the substantive accusation, but the court said in an interim ruling in January that “at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa” were “plausible” including “the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts”. Would you look at that – it is almost time for question time. Hold on to your loved ones. Susan McDonald attacks Labor’s critical minerals agenda The love-in that has been the Mineral Council’s conference, also known as the “which major party loves the resources sector more, let us count the ways”, has heard from both major leaders now. Peter Dutton, however, was not asked about his opposition to the production credits the government has proposed as part of its critical minerals Future Made in Australia policy. Dutton had called the production credits “welfare for billionaires” but apparently asking Dutton if he would keep them wasn’t a priority of the conference during his appearance. The LNP senator Susan McDonald did touch on the credits, and it seems the Coalition is still not a fan: Their entire critical minerals agenda has been focused on the production tax credits, the un-costed, un-mapped and un-delivered production tax credit that is a major plank of the so called Future Made in Australia policy. It is fast becoming a never-to-be-made-in-Australia policy. Just on Peter Dutton’s final point there, what he never mentions is the cost of private consultants who come in to do the job when public servants are sacked. The jobs still have to get done – and when the public servants are not there, consultants are contracted, usually at much higher hourly rates than a public servant, to complete the projects. Dutton says Australians ‘crying themselves to sleep’, unable to pay for insurance, car costs and school fees Peter Dutton has labelled Anthony Albanese’s government “a Whitlam-style government” whose policies would deliver “dire consequences” for Australia’s economy if it was given another term in office. Answering audience questions at the Minerals Council annual conference, Dutton has condemned the government’s industrial relations, tax policies and compliance arrangements as undermining productivity and taking Australia back to the 1970s. Dutton said Australians were “crying themselves to sleep”, unable to pay insurance policies, car costs and school fees. That’s the reality of life at the moment and of what has happened in this country in just a very short period of two years. Dutton queried the growth of the federal public service. You’ve got to ask yourself: do we need 36,000 more public servants?” Dutton says he will ‘turbocharge’ mining and de-fund the Environmental Defender’s Office if he wins office Peter Dutton has vowed to “turbocharge” the mining industry, saying he will de-fund the Environmental Defender’s Office if he wins office at the next election and overturn Tanya Plibersek’s decision rejecting one aspect of the proposed McPhillamys goldmine project in central-western NSW. He said he would halve and then cap timeframes for approving resources projects. I want to see more excavators digging. I want to see more gas flowing and more trucks moving and that requires removing those regulatory roadblocks which have needlessly inhibited projects coming online until years after they should have started. Dutton said he wanted to mine, export and use more uranium. He said a Dutton Coalition government would be “the best friend” of Australia’s resources sector. To support you, to make your industry strong, is to support our country and to make that country strong into the future as well. Peter Dutton has vowed to stand “unashamedly” with Australia’s resources sector if he wins office at the next election, accusing the Albanese government of using cultural heritage protection laws to “stymie” important resource projects. Addressing the Minerals Council’s annual conference in Canberra on Wednesday, Dutton said he was concerned “the bad old days are returning” under the Albanese government, with industrial law favouring unions and hurting the wealth-creating mining industry. He accused Labor of making what he called “adversarial policies” to silence internal critics, protect itself against the Greens’ electoral threat and appease unions. “These three factors - placating the party members, preventing the bleeding of the votes, and pleasing the union bosses - are shaping much of the government’s policy platform,” Dutton said. “So let’s be under no misapprehension that the government is putting partisan interests and political survival ahead of our national interests.” He said returning Labor at the next election risked the prosperity of the resources sector “and all Australians”. There were snakes in the parliament today (I think you can finish the joke yourself). A Threatened Species day event was held, meaning MPs piled into the courtyard to have photos with animals. Mike Bowers was there: Price cites Barossa gas project as one being affected by Indigeneity claims Asked which projects are affected by alleged opportunistic claims, Price cited the Barossa project, which sparked a federal court case in which Justice Natalie Charlesworth concluded that the views of three Tiwi traditional owners were not “broadly representative” of the beliefs of Tiwi people who would be affected by the pipeline and concluded that the EDO had engaged in “subtle coaching” of Tiwi Islanders. Price said: The problem is that we do know - and this is an issue that is brought up quite regularly, that is of concern to Aboriginal groups - of people claiming to be part of those groups who aren’t. There is an unnatural incredible increase on those who call themselves Indigenous and establish themselves within certain groups ... We’re hearing the calls from Aboriginal people across the country who are sick of the exploitation and we need to have it sorted out one way or another instead of completely turning a blind eye to it, which is what the Albanese government is doing. In fact, the Albanese government is already developing a national standard for First Nations engagement as part of its proposed environmental laws, which will clarify for proponents which Indigenous groups need to be consulted. Asked if the increasing proportion of people identifying as Indigenous needs to be tested, Price responded: It is an absolute problem. This is why we’ve got to clean up the whole process, clean up these organisations, and focus on supporting marginalised Australians not on the basis of race but on the basis of need. Because of the opportunities that exist there are those that would seek to advantage of those opportunities. ‘False’ claims of Indigeneity being made to thwart projects, shadow minister for Indigenous Australians says The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, has suggested that “false” claims of Indigeneity or membership of an Indigenous group are being made to thwart projects seeking environmental approval. Asked how the Coalition plan to “designate” which Indigenous groups would be consulted by project proponents, Price told reporters in Canberra: We’ll be looking at what the structures are that currently exists, that they’re doing their work appropriately so that what we don’t, in fact, get are those who are making false claims to try to bring an end to development projects in those areas. We want to make sure there is less opportunity for opportunists to come along and put an end to projects, particularly when, as we’ve seen, the Environmental Defenders Office exploit Indigenous Australians for the purpose of shutting down projects. Senator Kerrynne Liddle backed Price on this point, arguing that traditional owners are being “ignored” because they are not members of “organisations that have been built to so-called represent them”. For those not watching the US presidential candidate debate (will someone please think of the cats!) Peter Dutton is about to deliver his “let’s be BFFs” speech to the Minerals Council shindig and the chair of Universities Australia, Professor David Lloyd, is about to give the National Press Club address. Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission ‘quite simply not as strong as it could or should be’, Kylea Tink says Following Andrew Wilkie and Helen Haines’ criticism of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission legislation, Kylea Tink also says it does not go far enough: The Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission is quite simply not as strong as it could or should be. We know self-regulation doesn’t work – in any sector. Placing the Privileges Committee in charge of sanctioning MPs found to have significantly breached the standards is like asking arsonists to put out their own fires and means there is no guarantee that disciplinary actions will be impactful. As with debate around other new integrity measures – including the National Anti-Corruption Commission – we must have a process and consequences that hold people to account and offer an appropriate level of transparency. Importantly, we must also acknowledge that, as a democracy, we are not breaking new ground here. In fact Australia is behind a number of other parliaments, including the UK, and for this reason I think we should be stepping into this boldly. Australians expect it and it’s time our parliament met those expectations. Advocates and MPs to hold press conference soon on Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission amendments After failing to have proposed amendments for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission passed in the House (most of the amendments were around strengthening the commission and making it more transparent) independent and crossbench MPs are going to try again in the Senate. A group of advocates and MPs pushing for a commission with more teeth will be holding a press conference on the issue very soon. Among the attendees are Renee Carr, the executive director of Fair Agenda, Saffron Zomer from the Australian Democracy Network and Andrew Wilkie, Larissa Waters, Kylea Tink, Helen Haines and Zoe Daniel. Queensland opposition promises inquiry into ‘horrific system failures’ behind childcare sex offender Queensland’s LNP opposition has promised a “major independent inquiry” into the police investigation of childcare worker sex offender Ashley Paul Griffith. Griffith was convicted of 307 sexual offences last week, committed at childcare centres where he worked in Brisbane and Italy between 2004 and 2022. He was caught after specialist police recognised blankets in child sexual abuse uploaded online. Griffith was twice investigated in 2021 and 2022 by a separate police unit after reports by children. Both times he was cleared. The LNP promised to direct the Queensland Family and Child Commissioner to conduct an inquiry into what they called the “horrific system failures that allowed one of the most dangerous and heinous self-confessed pedophiles in Australian history to repeatedly offend in Queensland.” The report would be made public once complete, they said. Shadow attorney general Tim Nicholls said the Griffith case “raises serious questions about the efficacy of a system that should have kept Queensland children safe” A monster was able to carry out his heinous crimes within the current system and we must do everything in our power to fix the failures of that system. This major inquiry will examine what went wrong, how it could have be prevented, and importantly it must rebuild faith in the child protection system. A police inquiry - which has not been made public - cleared their investigation in 2022. Police minister Mark Ryan has already ordered a second internal review following Griffith’s conviction. Health minister Shannon Fentiman yesterday said “if there is anything that comes up in that review that requires us to look more broadly, then we will.” The investigation would commence following the sentencing of Griffith. Jason Clare introduces National Student Ombudsman legislation There was a lot of emotion as Jason Clare announced he would be introducing legislation to establish a National Student Ombudsman. Camille Schloeffel, a survivor advocate and founder of The Stop campaign and founder and director of End Rape on Campus Sharna Bremner are among those who walked a very long road to get to this point and were in Canberra to see the legislation be introduced. Independent MP Helen Haines backed fellow independent Andrew Wilkie in his attempt to strengthen the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission, with an amendment calling on the privileges committee to be made to publish why it may not follow recommendations made by the review panel. It was voted down. Shadow resources minister says it is ‘unfortunate’ there was no bipartisan approach to the voice referendum Answering questions at the Minerals Council’s annual conference, Senator Susan McDonald said it was “unfortunate that there wasn’t an opportunity to have any sort of bipartisan approach” to last year’s voice referendum. So now we are going back to what we believe, which is that there is local community groups who are acknowledged and recognised, both in legislation [and] reality.” McDonald referred again to Tanya Plibersek’s decision to reject the proposed location of a tailings dam at the proposed McPhillamys goldmine near Blayney in NSW on the basis of advice from the Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation when another group, the Orange Local Aboriginal Land Council (OLALC) which initially opposed the development, later changed its position to neutral. McDonald said formal Indigenous designation was required to assist the mining industry so “they don’t end up with this, you know, frankly horrifying situation where a group in Orange, who are the recognised native title holders, were disregarded”. Coalition and Labor senators vote down bill to ban native forest logging A private member’s bill put forward by former Greens senator Janet Rice to ban native forest logging, has been put up for debate in the Senate – and the Coalition and Labor senators voted it down. Private member’s bills are at the mercy of the House and Senate in terms of when they come they come up for debate – and if the government isn’t supporting them, then it can take a very, very long time. Greens senator Nick McKim was scathing in response to the vote: Labor and the Coalition have turned their backs on Australia’s forests, our wildlife and our future. Today’s vote – which had the support of crossbenchers Senator Pocock and Senator Payman – shows that the only thing standing in the way of ending native forest logging is the Labor party. They’re choosing to protect the interests of logging corporations over the environment and the long-term survival of threatened species like the Leadbeater’s possum and the Swift parrot. The evidence is clear – native forest logging has to end if we are serious about protecting biodiversity and addressing climate change.” Shadow resources minister Susan McDonald has questioned Indigeneity in relation to heritage claims over mining developments and demanded the government designate approved Indigenous groups, singling out a proposed New South Wales goldmine project as impeded by “activist lawfare”. “Often, keynote speeches include a traditional acknowledgment of the land on which we meet,” McDonald said on Wednesday, in opening remarks to the Minerals Council annual conference which did not include an Indigenous acknowledgement. “But after the Labor government’s decision on Blayney goldmine, I don’t know anymore how we are supposed to confidently determine who the traditional custodians are.” McDonald said Indigeneity used to be about how a person defined themselves and “the impacts of that decision were largely confined to themselves”. “But now, the impacts can be imposed on others,” McDonald said. “Now, how someone identifies – who they identify with – can now jeopardise an entire gas or mining operation, deprive other Australians of jobs and income, and deprive other Indigenous Australians of their collective say on the future of their communities.” She said the government must designate “recognised” Indigenous communities and vowed that a Coalition government would do so if it won office The resources sector cannot be left to guess.” The house is rocketing through its morning agenda. It is a Senate-only week next week, so the government is trying to get through as many bills as it can, to ensure the senate is kept busy. You can follow along with the business, here. RBA chief economist to speak on employment Sarah Hunter, the Reserve Bank’s chief economist, is giving a speech this morning in Sydney on “Understanding the journey to full employment”. As the title hints, we’re not there yet, and although the unemployment rate has been rising, it will likely have to go higher – in the RBA’s estimates – before the labour market becomes “consistent with low and stable inflation”. On the face of it, there’s not a lot new in the speech given that we haven’t had any major stats on employment since July figures landed four weeks ago when the jobless rate ticked higher to 4.2%. The economy, though, was still generating new jobs at a rapid clip. (We get August numbers on 19 September.) Hunter: [O]ur current assessment is that the labour market is operating above full employment but has moved towards better balance since late 2022. The question is whether that movement can continue without another RBA interest rate rise (unlikely but still a chance) or the jobless rate jumping more higher than the 4.4% level that looks to be the RBA’s present maximum over the coming couple of years. Employers are cutting hours and there are fewer job vacancies, but Australia has also got more people looking for work. Should the participation rate ease back from record levels, for instance, the unemployment rate may hover closer to the 4% rather than, say, rise towards 5%. No doubt politicians will be watching as closely as the RBA in coming months. Stay tuned for Hunter’s answers to audience questions, which may provide additional insight. Further details on proposed student ombudsman and national code The education minister has provided additional detail on Labor’s legislation to introduce Australia’s first dedicated student ombudsman and national code to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in the higher education sector. The ombusdman will allow students to escalate complaints about the actions of their higher education providers, operating independently, impartially and with a trauma-informed complaints mechanism. The code will then enforce stricter prevention and responses to gender-based violence across the sector – including student accommodation providers. The ombudsman will be legislated first, with a new expert unit being established in the Department of Education currently working on the code. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said for too long students hadn’t been heard. That begins to change with this legislation. I want to thank Sharna Bremner from End Rape on Campus, Camille Schloeffel and the team from the STOP Campaign, Renee Carr from Fair Agenda, Dr Allison Henry and all those who have fought for this. New alliance proposes $5bn investment in rooftop solar and thermal improvements A new alliance, including faith groups, social services, unions, clean industry, regional communities and climate and environment organisations, is launching one of its first major policies today. Renew Australia for All is working on climate and energy solutions and one of its first priorities is to help people access renewable energy home upgrades, regardless of their living conditions. The energy bill savings plan calls for an initial $5bn investment, backed by $50bn over a decade, to “repower homes and communities everywhere with rooftop solar, batteries, electric appliances and thermal improvements, so that all Australians reap the benefits”. ACTU president Michele O’Neil, who is part of the alliance, said: We are a large and diverse coalition united in our knowledge that the best way to cut power bills fast while creating good jobs is to support all Australian households to reap the benefits of having solar panels, batteries, and electric appliances in their own homes. We need to help all households harness the power of Australia’s abundant sun and wind – not saddle them with the cost of an expensive nuclear fantasy. Plibersek tells resources sector she will ‘carefully weigh the evidence’ on mine approvals Tanya Plibersek has told the resources sector that the government t would “respect and protect” Australia’s cultural heritage because “nobody wants another Juukan Gorge”. In a speech to the Minerals Council’s annual conference, Plibersek promised the resources sector that the government would always “carefully weigh the evidence” and listen to advice when considering whether to approve mining projects. In what appeared to a veiled reference to the pushback against her rejection on Indigenous heritage grounds of one aspect of the proposed McPhillamys goldmine project near Blayney in central western New South Wales, Plibersek said the sector would not always agree with her decisions. There will be times as a minister that l make decisions that you like … But hard decisions are part of this job and l’m not going to shy away from them. Plibersek rejected the proposed location of a tailings dam within the McPhillamys project, prompting the proponent, Regis Resources, to declare the project unviable. Addressing the council on Wednesday, Plibersek praised the contribution of the resources sector but emphasised her determination to protect heritage when necessary. What you will get from me and from this government, though, is a commitment to carefully weigh the evidence, to listen to advice, to apply the law, and a commitment to make approvals that are quicker and easier wherever we can. She said she had undertaken to consider expeditiously a reapplication with a different location for the tailings dam. Queensland government says gender pay gap among public servents is at ‘all-time low’ The Queensland government has claimed success in narrowing the gender pay gap among public servants. The premier, Steven Miles, told parliament this morning that the gender pay gap was at an “all-time low”. Female Queensland public servants are only paid 5.94% less than their male counterparts, about half the national average, he said. About 70% of the state’s public servants are women. The pay gap also narrowed for the other “diversity target groups”: Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with a disability, culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and women in leadership. Today’s data is proof that what we are doing is working, but there’s always more to do. Kylea Tink welcomes ban on insurers discriminating based on genetic testing The independent MP Kylea Tink has welcomed the news the government is moving to ban insurance companies from having access to genetic data. You can read more about the decision here: Tink: Everybody should have the right to ensure their genetic data isn’t used to discriminate against them. I have advocated strongly for a full ban on genetic discrimination since I was elected by the North Sydney community. This has included making public calls for reform, submissions to inquiries, meetings with the assistant treasurer and hosting advocates and those with lived experience in parliament to call for this change. By banning insurers from accessing the results of private genetic tests, Australia is removing a barrier to better health and financial security that simply doesn’t make sense in this day and age. We now have the ability to predict and treat diseases more effectively, helping Australians live longer and healthier lives yet, up until now, the risk of genetic discrimination by insurers has discouraged many from getting tested. This ban will finally remove that barrier, ensuring that genetic testing can be used to improve health, and deliver financial security through life insurance, without fear of discrimination. Indigenous rangers meet with MPs over plastic pollution Rangers from the Northern Territory have arrived in Canberra to meet with MPs over plastic pollution along the Arnhem Land coast. Dhirmurru Rangers said they collected 10 tonnes of plastic in just one cleanup of 5km of coastline. For visual purposes, that is like finding 60 2L milk bottles every metre. The rangers want the government to commit to stronger action through the global plastics treaty and join the global ghost gear initiative – a campaign focused around lost and abandoned fishing gear. The rangers are particularly focused on fishing nets, which tangles marine animals as it drifts. Wanga Mununggurritj, a senior ranger with the Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation, said: Plastic pollution harms the health of land and sea Country and requires urgent action. We came to Parliament House in Canberra to ask the Australian Government to support Dhimurru Rangers and all other rangers across our communities to help stop plastic pollution including ghost nets to protect Country for the next generation. King says WA Liberals and Nationals support Labor minerals tax incentives The resources minister, Madeleine King, also used her speech to continue the “who loves you more” battle the Labor government is having with the opposition when it comes to the resources sector. The government put the critical minerals and rare earths industry at the heart of its policymaking through the Future Made in Australia plan. Under that plan, the government committed to [a] $17.6bn critical minerals production tax incentive. As you know, this measure is being opposed by the Coalition. [The] shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, was out attacking the policy as “welfare for billionaires” within just a few hours of the budget being released, without checking in with businesses that all had input into designing the Incentives. The shadow treasurer probably should also have taken a moment to check with his Western Australian colleagues. Alongside Western Australian premier Roger Cook, the Western Australian Liberals and Nationals all support our production tax incentives. And I note reading The West Australian this week, some federal WA Liberals are also wishing Mr Dutton would change his mind on this. It remains baffling to me why the Coalition would choose to dismiss industry driven policy for the sake of getting up a soundbite about “welfare for billionaires”. This is no way to run resources policy. Even from opposition. Resources minister says ‘we can always do better’ on mine approvals The resources minister, Madeleine King, delivered her address to the minerals industry people who are in Canberra for Minerals’ week. King was asked about the approvals process for mines in Australia and said: There are frustrations at some levels about how long approvals can take. The World Bank puts us fourth on rankings on how we do run our approvals processes. I admit and I have said this in public that we can always do better and seek to do so. It’s a continuous improvement is what I like to say. PM calls for police to be respected by protesters Anthony Albanese was asked about the Melbourne protest on the Seven network earlier this morning: People have a right to protest peacefully, but you don’t say you’re opposed to defence equipment by throwing things at police. They’ve got a job to do and our police officers should be respected at all times. You can read more about the protest in Melbourne here: Meta allows deepfake posts to stay up if labelled as AI-generated David Pocock‘s deepfake videos of the prime minister and opposition leader were allowed to remain on Meta’s platforms because he acknowledged they were deepfakes in the videos, Meta has said. On Sunday, Pocock released an AI deepfake video of Anthony Albanese announcing a complete ban on gambling advertising, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, supporting the ban on advertising, in order to show the dangers of deepfakes on politics. On Wednesday, Pocock pointed out the videos were still up, and Meta’s director of public policy for APAC, Simon Milner, said it was due to how Pocock had framed the video: Political advertisers are required to disclose if an ad that they post contains certain kinds of photorealistic video or realistic sounding audio, which was digitally created or altered by AI. And we also require people to disclose when they post organic content ... you made it clear to people that these were the altered and therefore that’s why those posts can stay on our platform. He said four policy people in Australia work on the platform’s handling of elections, and the company was dedicated to working with election authorities and was committed to labelling misleading content. David Pocock urges parliament to sit longer to pass anti-AI electoral laws David Pocock, the independent senator for the ACT, has called for parliament to sit for longer this year if it means it can successfully pass legislation on AI use during elections. Appearing on Guardian Australia’s daily news podcast Full Story, Pocock said: We make up our own rules … let’s sit longer, let’s add another week or two to dedicate to working through legislation that would enhance and protect our democracy at the upcoming election. If experts are saying we expect to see the use of generative AI, why aren’t we dealing with it? Last weekend, Senator Pocock pulled a deepfake AI trick, posting apparent videos of Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton agreeing to ban gambling ads.

We Vote for Palestine campaign touts some stats The We Vote for Palestine campaign – which is targeting local elections – says that a week after launching, it has: 1,500 people have pledged to vote for candidates that will fight for Palestine. 4,000 emails have been sent by constituents to their local candidates requesting they take the WVFP pledge. 130 NSW candidates have taken the pledge so far. WVFP announces plans to open pledges for VIC Candidates late September. You can read more about the campaign (and others) and the role it could play in coming elections, here: And a reminder that this Saturday is NSW council election voting day. If you’re not voting early, don’t forget to look for where you can snag a sanger on the day. Liberals accuse Meta of bias in AI hearing Liberal senator James McGrath has questioned Meta executives if the company is biased against the Coalition, alleging Meta has donated $40,000 to the Labor party in the past 20 years but has not donated to the Coalition. McGrath asked whether this demonstrated that Meta was biased against the Coalition in its distribution of news. Simon Milner, Meta’s director of public policy for APAC, disputed the notion that Meta is a distributor of news and that the company was biased: Just to be clear, we are not a news distributor. It is not what we do. That’s not what our services do, and also we do not take any political position. McGrath made the comments in response to what he said were biased responses from Meta’s AI chat bot to questions about the greatest Australian prime ministers, which he said previously only mentioned Labor PMs, but Meta said that response had changed in recent months. McGrath also suggested the bot was giving biased responses when asked about Hamas. Milner said Meta was working with researchers to improve the responses given, and it showed the need for more data in the AI: It is incredibly helpful to have a lot of data from Australians in the training models, because that enables us to have output from those models, both in terms of what we produce and what others produce, which reflects the diversity of Australian society, including the range of different political beliefs and positions from across the country. Recent ADF or DoD staff will also be prevented from being appointed to lead regulator A government source familiar with the amendments said: Since announcing the Aukus pathway, the government has stated that Australia will not be responsible for the storage or disposal of spent nuclear fuel from the US, UK or other countries (that is, the part of the submarine that generates high-level radioactive waste). As responsible nuclear stewards, we will ONLY be responsible for high-level radioactive waste from our own, sovereign nuclear-powered submarines. To put the matter beyond doubt, the government will move to amend the ANNPS bill to clarify that nothing in the bill is to be taken to authorise the storage or disposal in Australia of spent nuclear fuel that is not from an Australian submarine. The government will also amend the bill to ensure that anyone who has worked in the Australian Defence Force or the Department of Defence in the previous 12 months cannot be appointed as director general or deputy director general of the new regulator. The federal government has bowed to pressure and will close a loophole in Aukus-related legislation to make clear that Australia will not accept high-level nuclear waste from the US, the UK or other countries. Later today, Labor plans to move amendments to its proposed legislation, the Australian naval nuclear power safety bill 2023. The bill covers the way the nuclear-powered submarine program will be regulated and includes the creation of a new statutory agency, the Australian naval nuclear power safety regulator. The government’s bill for regulating nuclear safety talked about “managing, storing or disposing of radioactive waste from an Aukus submarine”, which it defined broadly as Australian, UK or US submarines. This prompted concerns from the Greens and other critics that it could pave the way for Australia to store waste from other countries. In May, a Labor-chaired inquiry called for a legislative safeguard to specifically rule out accepting high-level nuclear waste from the US and the UK. The government will move a series of amendments to its own legislation today to address these concerns. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the amendments would “reaffirm the government’s already-established commitment that Australia will not be responsible for the storage or disposal of high-level radioactive waste from the US, UK or other countries”. Meta can’t say if Australians will get ability to opt-out of Ai data scraping The parent company of Facebook and Instagram could not say why European users can opt out of having their data scraped by Meta’s AI for training, but Australian users cannot. Meta has paused its launch of its AI product in Europe due to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy rules and users based in Europe can opt out of Meta’s AI training on their data. The Labor chair of the inquiry examining AI policy, Tony Sheldon, on Tuesday question Meta executives why it was good enough for European users but not Australians. He said: I’ll be very frank with you. I’d like to opt out in Australia ... and I’d like to have the options similar to Europe, for all Australians, including for myself personally. Why can’t I have that option? After being asked whether Australians would get the option, Melinda Claybaugh, Meta’s director of privacy policy, said the Europe offer was “in response to a very specific legal frame” and would not say whether Australians would be able to get similar rights. Earlier in the hearing, Claybaugh stressed Meta’s model is trained from publicly scraped data from the internet, which in terms of Facebook and Instagram would be posts that users have set to public. Speaker to appear before joint committee on civic education and engagement The speaker of the house, Milton Dick, will appear in front of the joint standing committee on electoral matters this morning. The committee is looking into “civics education, engagement and participation in Australia”. Dick, even before he was speaker, had a keen interest in these areas, and he has been trying to bring back some decorum to proceedings like question time, because of how much the rabble can turn people off. Student ombudsman law and mandatory national code on fighting gender violence to be introduced The education minister, Jason Clare, will introduce legislation to parliament today to establish the nation’s first Student Ombudsman and a mandatory National Code for universities to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. As part of his address, Clare will refer to meetings with women from the STOP campaign, End Rape on Campus and from Fair Agenda who detailed “a confused and inadequate response process within our universities” to gender-based violence: … a response process where one in two students felt like they weren’t being heard when they made a complaint. In short, a protracted failure of the higher education sector, and of government, to do anything to properly address a situation summarised so poignantly – and so heartbreakingly – in the words of this student: ‘I’m sick of my friends being assaulted, I’m sick of begging to feel safe, and I’m sick of feeling ignored’. Well, today, we act. The national student ombudsman will be a new statutory function of the commonwealth ombudsman to handle student complaints on a “broad range” of issues aside from gender-based violence, in cooperation with education departments and the regulator. Additional police are reportedly being sent to the Melbourne exhibition centre – where a global military and weapons expo is being held – as anti-war protests continue. Peter Dutton will deliver his speech to the minerals’ week crowd at parliament house later today, where he will declare he is the ride or die, BFF, bestie to the mining sector. Sussan Ley told Sky News, essentially, “no cap”: We know that we will be, and we are, the best friend that the mining industry in Australia will ever have, and you only had to be in the great hall in this Parliament a couple of nights ago, to listen to Anthony Albanese’s tone deaf speech, not getting the perfect storm that is confronting an industry that has created much of Australia’s wealth, prosperity, national income and jobs right across this country, including Queensland, including the Hunter, including Western Australia. So we have to get this right. And to see that industry, as I said, facing this perfect storm of policies around industrial relations, energy policies, environmental approvals, red tape. Remember, these are global companies, and they don’t need to invest in Australia. They can choose somewhere else in the world. So, we have to get this right. And I know the government has not got it right. (Mining companies can not just ‘choose somewhere else in the world’. They go where the minerals and resources they want are. And a lot of those minerals and resources are in Australia.) Sussan Ley: anti-arms ‘protesters should get a job’ Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley’s team have released her transcript from her interview this morning on Sky News. The topics, according to her staff? Coalition’s paid parental leave changes; mining; Melbourne [protesters] should get a job The protesters Ley are referring to are those who are protesting in front of the global military and weapons expo happening inside Melbourne’s convention and exhibition centre. Well, my thoughts are for law enforcement, when confronted with these large numbers and our police and the people who keep us safe are diverted from all of the things they need to be doing to address this sort of nonsense. These people need to get a job. They need to actually, it’s like rent a crowd every single time we have one of these protests, I back our defence industries every single day of the week and I know that Australians massively and absolutely do so as well. Government promotes recognition of coercive control abuse, especially amongst young people As reported a bit earlier this morning, the government is releasing new resources to help younger people recognise coercive control. Coercive control is an abusive behaviour which can create power and dominance over people. It doesn’t have to be physical abuse – it can be anything which leaves someone feeling intimidated and over time, can take away a person’s independence and freedom. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says coercive control “almost always underpins family and domestic violence”: Understanding and identifying these dynamics is fundamental to an effective response to family and domestic violence. The new resources include videos and fact sheets for young people entering into relationships to help identify what it can look like, and what someone can do if it happens. If you or someone you know is affected by family, domestic or sexual violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit www.1800RESPECT.org.au. HMAS Sydney deploys to support UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea The HMAS Sydney has begun its latest work in Operation Argos, which has been established to support the United Nations Security Council’s sanctions against North Korea. HMAS Sydney and its crew will “monitor and deter illegal ship-to-ship transfers of sanction goods in the region,” Defence says. Australia has been part of Operation Argos since 2018 and in that time 12 ships have been deployed alongside 13 maritime patrol aircraft. Vice Admiral Justin Jones, the chief of joint operations, said Australia remained “committed to enforcing United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea until it takes concrete steps towards denuclearisation”: Defence regularly deploys ADF assets on Operation Argos to monitor and deter shipments of sanctioned goods, alongside partners including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These deployments, as part of an international pressure campaign on North Korea to denuclearise, demonstrate Australia’s commitment to the global rules-based order.” Queensland Greens push for state-owned mining company Speaking of the Greens, the Queensland Greens have announced they want to set up a state-owned mining company (it’s not as odd as it sounds). The party will launch the policy today at state parliament. A tenatively named Queensland Minerals would exploit some of the estimated half-a-billion dollars worth of critical minerals in the north-west minerals Province, near Mt Isa. The company would mine minerals like zinc, cobalt, copper, lead and gold, all of them necessary for renewable energy development. Greens MP Michael Berkman said about 86% of the profits of the existing mining sector goes offshore because the industry is owned by “big multinational corporations”. Instead of squandering the next mining boom sending profits overseas, the Greens want to keep them right here in Queensland. 100% of profits from Queensland Minerals would go back to the people of Queensland, with an extra $14bn to spend on things like hospitals, schools and housing. The best job for a coalminer is another mining job, which is why we’d give former coal and gas workers priority for jobs at Queensland Minerals. The governments of several countries, like Norway’s and Chile’s, own their own mining companies. About a third of the world’s resource production is carried out by state-owned firms. There is a very big battle between Labor and the Coalition for the state of Western Australia occurring at the moment. The Liberals see Tagney and the independent-held Curtin as gains, while the WA Nationals are making a play for the new seat of Bulwinkle (which would be a bit historic in its own right, given the Nats haven’t had a federal member since Tony Crook held O’Connor between 2010-2013. The WA Nationals are not in alliance with the WA Liberals) WA helped Labor to majority government at the last election and is crucial to the plans of both major parties at the next poll. And mining has once again become a hot-button issue, with both the major party leaders claiming they are the greatest friend to WA in Canberra (Peter Dutton will be very explicit about that in his coming speech to the minerals’ council today) The assistant minister to the prime minister, Patrick Gorman, has written an op-ed in the West Australian newspaper ahead of Dutton’s speech where he takes aim…. at the Greens. The Greens Party is eroding democracy more than you know. The combination of their “block everything” approach and their dishonest slogans is undermining democracy. Gone are the environmental campaigners of the 1990s that I remember from growing up in Fremantle. Replacing them is a marketing machine that, like a pyramid scheme, only cares about its own survival. And it is the people who vote for them who get hurt the most. I have sat in parliament gobsmacked at the Greens’ destructive approach that has defined them this term. They tried to destroy the Housing Australia Future Fund. The Greens led the protection racket for the corruption in the CFMEU. Now the Greens say they will vote to oppose environmental protection australia [legislation]. I am a progressive. Sadly the Greens are now just aggressive Anthony Albanese is starting the day in Sydney, where he will greet Australia’s Paralympians who are returning home from Paris. The official welcome starts at 8.30 Dan Tehan outraged over tattered flag after devastating winds Liberal frontbencher Dan Tehan is continuing to moonlight as Australia’s flag hall monitor. Canberra, like a lot of NSW and Victoria, was hit by very strong winds recently – strong enough to bring down trees – and the flag above parliament house, which flies 24 hours a day (with a special dispensation to fly at night – it is a whole protocol thing) didn’t do so well. The staff who look after it only go up when its safe to do so. But Tehan is OUTRAGED (once again – this is a running theme with Tehan) that the flag is not looking pristine. It’s not the government’s job to look after the flag – it’s the job of apolitical parliament staff. Tehan knows that, but here we are. House values dropped in almost 80% of Melbourne suburbs in the past three months, property data shows, with falls also recorded across 30% of suburbs analysed nationally. The data from CoreLogic analysed values in 3,655 suburbs over the three months until August. The ABS says there are 15,353 suburbs and localities across the country. In a statement, CoreLogic said it found Melbourne (79.1%) and regional Victorian suburbs (73.8%) made up the majority of falls over the quarter. More than half of the suburbs in Hobart (54.3%), Darwin (51.2%), and Canberra (51.6%) also experienced declining values, while all suburbs analysed in Perth saw values increase. Kaytlin Ezzy, an economist at CoreLogic, said quarterly value declines were becoming more common as high interest rates and cost of living challenges continued to bite: While values are still rising at the national level, albeit at a slowing pace, beneath the headline figure, we’re starting to see some weakness, particularly in Victoria. Ezzy said declines in Melbourne were concentrated in more affluent regions. The proportion of suburbs in quarterly decline nationally was 29.2% in August, up from 17.2% a year ago. After Melbourne, Sydney was the Australian city with the largest increase in the proportion of suburbs in decline over the past year, from 3.8% to 25.9%. A very big thank you to Martin for starting us off on what is going to be a jam packed day – and that’s not even counting the US presidential candidate debate. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day – ready? Let’s get into it. Experts call for vaping enforcement in wake of uptake study More on that vaping study we mentioned earlier: Public health experts say the research highlights why the government’s vaping reforms introduced this year now need to be strongly enforced. Prof Becky Freeman, the study’s supervisor from the University of Sydney, said “when it comes to teenage smoking, up until recently Australia was an international success story. Our Australian teenage ever-smoking rates dropped from 58% in 1996, to 14% in 2023. But recent data has suggested a possible increase in teenage smoking over the same time period that vape use has exploded.” “Public health experts have warned that teenage vaping uptake has the potential to undo the positive progress Australia has made in reducing smoking. This latest study shows how real that threat is.” Adjunct Prof Terry Slevin, chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, says that while public health experts have welcomed the reforms positive change won’t happen overnight. “We need to make sure that state and territory governments are harmonising their local legislation and enforcement with the federal reforms. All levels of government will need to work together to protect young people.” Caitlin Cassidy has been reading through the speech to be made by Universities Australia chair Prof David Lloyd at the National Press Club today. In it, he will accuse both sides of parliament of using the tertiary education sector as a “political plaything” in a scathing critique of Labor’s proposed international student cap. Here’s her full story: Teenagers who vape are at least five times more likely to go on to try smoking than those who have never vaped, new research has found. The study published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health found an “alarming trend”: the younger a person starts vaping, the higher their risk that they will subsequently try smoking. The researchers calculated 12-year-olds who had vaped were 29 times more likely to go on to try smoking than those who had never vaped, 13 year olds were over 11 times more likely, and 14 year olds six times more likely. By comparison, 17 year olds were twice as likely to have tried smoking if they had vaped. The study analysed the answers of 5,114 teenagers aged 14 to 17 who took part in the Generation Vape survey in 2023, recalling information going back to when they were 12 years of age. Using the responses to questions about their age and the order of starting smoking/vaping, the researchers constructed retrospective timelines of initiation events. “While e-cigarettes may have been initially claimed as a smoking cessation aid for adult smokers, the stark disparities in [rates] for younger adolescents are a sobering reminder of the broader public health consequences of a market that has failed to contain vaping product marketing and access,” the researchers wrote. They also found the initiation of vaping appeared just as likely to lead to smoking beyond non-experimental levels as to mere initiation of a few puffs. Lead author Sam Egger from the Daffodil Centre said: “It’s the first Australian study to look at the relationship between teenage vape use and smoking over time, and across different ages.” Royal visit to include fleet review, cancer research and meeting with First Nations groups The Sydney schedule for the king and queen’s visit doesn’t yet include the King Charles III Stakes horse race, scheduled to run at Randwick on the first full day of his visit. The king’s mother was famed for her love of horse racing but her son reportedly didn’t share the same fervour. But it will include both royals conducting a fleet review of the Royal Australian Navy and an appearance at a “community BBQ celebrating Australia’s cultural diversity and showcasing quality produce from across New South Wales”. Charles will meet the Australians of the Year, Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, who will brief him on cancer research. His schedule in Sydney also includes a meeting with First Nations representatives and groups. The exact dates for each of these commitments are yet to be confirmed. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement: The royal visit is an opportunity to showcase the best of Australia – our rich culture, our sense of community, and contributions to science, research and global progress. His Majesty first visited Australia in 1966, and has a strong personal affection for our nation. We are delighted that His Majesty is recovering well and has made visiting Australia once again a priority. Australians look forward to welcoming the King and Queen back to Australia in October, and highlighting the best of the Australian spirit. Royal visit details announced King Charles and Queen Camilla will hear about the global impacts of the climate crisis, meet political and community leaders and inspect naval ships during their visit to Australia next month. Buckingham Palace and the Australian government have released details about the royal visit scheduled to run from 18 October to 23 October, with stops in Canberra and Sydney. Charles and Camilla are expected to be welcomed to Parliament House and attend a reception for political and community leaders. They are also expected to meet Australians who have excelled in the fields of health, arts, culture and sport. The king and queen are expected to attend the Australian War Memorial and visit the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra, where they will “meet with staff and volunteers to discuss the global impacts of climate change”, according to a summary of the schedule. Charles will also hear from CSIRO scientists on their work to deal with the impact of bushfires in Australia, while Camila will join a discussion on family and domestic violence. Dutton to slash environmental activist powers if elected Peter Dutton says he will slash the power and influence of environmental groups to challenge mining proposals if he wins government, Australian Associated Press reports. “A government that I lead will not allow activists to dictate economic policy and to pull the handbrake on our prosperity,” Dutton is expected to say in an address to the Minerals Council of Australia on Wednesday, according to notes distributed to the media in advance. Dutton will commit to defunding the Environmental Defenders Office and limiting the ability for third parties to challenge decisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act if he becomes prime minister. “And we will cut green tape while striking the right balance between our responsibilities to the environment and the economy,” the notes read. The Environmental Defenders Office, the national body dedicated to protecting climate and communities through running litigation and advocating for law reform, had millions of dollars of federal funding restored by Labor after it was cut in 2013. Dutton will promise to “turbocharge” the mining sector to help steer the nation through the economic slump and into another boom. “A Dutton coalition government will be the best friend that the mining and resources sector in Australia will ever have,” he will say. “I want to see more excavators digging, more gas flowing, and more trucks moving. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog following all the news and developments from Canberra – but also around the country. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ve got some of the early headlines before Amy Remeikis takes you through the main action. Our top story this morning highlights the plight of asylum seekers detained on Manus and now stranded in Papua New Guinea who face being made homeless this week because they can’t afford to pay their rent. Asylum seekers have been threatened with eviction if an alleged $110,000 rental arrears debt is not paid, leading to urgent calls for the Australian government to intervene to prevent them becoming “homeless”. The chair of Universities Australia will accuse both sides of parliament of using the tertiary education sector as a “political plaything” in a scathing critique of Labor’s proposed international student cap. Speaking at the National Press Club today, Prof David Lloyd will call the decision to cap international student enrolments at a maximum of 270,000 the most “extraordinary intervention” by a government into universities since the Morrison government vetoed six Australian Research Council grants in 2021. Teenagers who vape are at least five times more likely to go on to try smoking than those who have never vaped, new research has found – more on that coming up. Some of the itinerary for the king and queen’s visit to Sydney and Canberra next month has been revealed; we’ll pop the details in this blog for you. And Peter Dutton is to give a speech today at Minerals Week in which he will promise to be a “best friend” to the mining industry, get rid of regulation and reduce the ability of environmental groups to challenge projects. He wants “more gas flowing and more trucks moving”."

                    "headline": "Sony reveals £700 PlayStation 5 Pro console",
                    "bodyText": "After months of rumours and speculation, Sony has finally revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro console, an update to its current machine, offering enhanced technical specifications and a 2TB solid state drive for £699/$699. It is launching on 7 November, with pre-orders beginning on 26 September. It is an expensive machine compared with current systems, coming in at £300 more than the Digital Edition PlayStation 5, which retails at £390. It’s also digital only: if you want to play games or movies on Blu-ray discs, you’ll have to add a Blu-ray player for an extra £100. For the price, what you’re getting is an upgraded graphics processing unit (GPU) featuring 67% more compute units than the original model (compute units are the individual processors within a GPU, which work in parallel to execute multiple threads of data simultaneously). With a 28% boost in system memory, Sony is claiming this will lead to a 45% increase in graphics rendering in games that support the updated machine. The Pro console will also support more advanced ray tracing, a visual effect that brings dynamic reflections to surfaces such as glass and water. Enhanced games will also be able to offer an 8K mode. Sony says that games patched to support the upgraded hardware will be identified with a “PS5 Pro Enhanced” label. These will include many of the company’s first party PS5 titles such as Horizon Forbidden West, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. Third-party publishers have also committed to support the machine with titles including Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Dragon’s Dogma 2 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth lined up to provide Pro enhancements. To support the rest of the back catalogue, PS5 Pro promises “AI-driven” upscaling of games to improve their performance on the new hardware. Sony also revealed what it calls the PS5 Pro Game Boost, which will improve the visual performance of “more than 8,500” backward compatible PS4 games. It has long been a business model for console manufacturers to update their machines after several years on the market. In the past, this usually meant more compact designs, such as the PS2 Slim, but the previous generation of Sony and Microsoft machines saw significant technical updates with both the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One X. Industry opinion is divided on how Sony’s latest update will fare, especially in a challenging economy and with no major new game release or fresh audio-visual technology to support. As analyst Rob Fahey recently wrote: “PS4 Pro justified its existence in a very straightforward way: many consumers had upgraded to 4K displays in the preceding years, and the Pro delivered a version of the PS4 that could support those displays.” On X, the memes have been merciless. However, veteran industry watcher Piers Harding-Rolls at Ampere Analysis told VGC he expects sales of around 1.3m PS5 Pros during the launch window and around 13m units by 2029. One major factor that could boost sales is the announced arrival of Grand Theft Auto 6 in autumn 2025, which will almost certainly be the biggest-selling game of its generation. Before Sony’s announcement, most pundits expected the PS5 Pro to be launched to coincide with GTA 6 thereby capitalising on excitement and ensuring its status as the most powerful console to play the new game on. It could be, however, that Sony is giving itself time to announce a price cut or bundle closer to the launch of Rockstar’s game. For now, the PS5 Pro is the culmination of a complicated month for Sony, which has seen Concord, its online shooter, withdraw from sale after just two weeks, but also the huge critical success of first-party platformer, Astro Bot – a game that doesn’t rely on hi-tech visual realism. The eyes of the industry will now be on Microsoft for its response. There are persistent rumours that the Redmond company is veering in a different direction, planning a portable version of the Xbox to compete in the burgeoning handheld PC gaming market against the likes of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally X. With prices for these machines reaching up to £800 this could be an expensive time for console consumers. • This article was amended on 11 September 2024 to correct the price difference between a standard PS5 and the PS5 Pro. The amount was originally stated in the article as £200, whereas the cheapest PS5 package is £390, making the difference more than £300."

                    "headline": "Meta’s AI is scraping users’ photos and posts. Europeans can opt out, but Australians cannot",
                    "bodyText": "Meta is using the public Facebook and Instagram photos and posts of its users to train artificial intelligence and, while European users have been allowed to opt out of the mass-scraping of their content, Australian users do not have that option, a parliamentary committee has heard. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram paused the launch of its AI product in Europe in July due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy rules, and as a result of GDPR law. Meta was ordered to stop training its large language model on data from European users on privacy concerns, and Meta has given European users an opt-out option. Labor’s chair of the inquiry examining AI adoption in Australia, senator Tony Sheldon, questioned Meta executives on Tuesday why that option had not been extended to Australian users. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “I’ll be very frank with you. I’d like to opt out in Australia … and I’d like to have the options similar to Europe, for all Australians, including for myself personally. Why can’t I have that option?” Melinda Claybaugh, Meta’s director of privacy policy, said it was only the posts of those who chose to make the post public – not just private to people you have friended – and only for those aged over 18. But Claybaugh said that the opt-out option in Europe was “in response to a very specific legal frame” and would not say whether such an option would be offered to Australians in the future. The Greens senator David Shoebridge said that meant that Australians would have had to set posts back to the start of their use of Facebook to private. “The truth of the matter is that, unless you consciously had set those posts to private, since 2007, Meta has just decided you will scrape all of the photos and all of the text from every public post on Instagram or Facebook that Australians have shared since 2007, unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private. But that’s actually the reality, isn’t it?” Shoebridge asked. “Correct,” Claybaugh replied. She said people could set their posts to private now to prevent future scraping. That would not account for the scraping that has already occurred. Sheldon said there were millions of Australians who used Facebook and Instagram who have not consented to using their photos, their videos, or the record of their lives and families to train an AI model. “I do think the people around the world are sick of tech companies, giants … doing whatever they want, completely ignoring laws and rights as they go because having those things taken off people, they feel as if their inherent right has been taken off them,” he said. “I do expect governments to do something about it.”"

                    "bodyText": "Trying to figure out what to focus on for the first post-Alex Hern TechScape was tricky. (If you missed it last week, you can and should revisit his valedictory newsletter after 11 years at The Guardian). Why? Well, everything is happening all the time now – so there are any number of topics to dive into. We could talk about the likelihood of Elon Musk running Donald Trump’s “government efficiency commission” if he is re-elected as US president. But that would involve doing another newsletter on Musk, and you may be as tired as Alex was of that. The likelihood of the latter is still a flip of the coin; the likelihood Musk would stop running his multi-trillion-dollar companies for a low-paying government job, less so. We could talk about Pavel Durov’s first public statement since his arrest in France last month, and how Telegram’s anti-censorship stance has crumbled (you can now report content in what used to be private chats that will be looked at by a moderator). Or we could talk about Nvidia’s integral role in the economy – but I spoke with Nimo Omer for Monday’s First Edition newsletter about that. Instead, let’s talk about the latest major moment on the tech beat, which has become exhaustingly full-on in recent years: Apple’s latest iPhone announcement. And why, despite the bells and whistles, and being a tech-adopting lot, I bet many of you won’t be lining up to buy it. The reasons are complicated. One is the simple cost of the iPhone 16, which starts at $799 (£610). For many, such a high price is too much – particularly when the economy is struggling, work is short and a new prime minister is branding himself as head of the “doom and gloom” government, as Observer political editor Toby Helm put it. “Sales of new mobile phones have dropped dramatically over the last decade,” says Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research company CCS Insight. In 2013, Brits bought almost 30m new devices. Last year, just 13.4m were sold. CSS Insight forecasts that figures will be around the same level. Their research suggests most people expect to keep the next phone they buy for up to five years. At the same time, phone makers are offering fewer dramatic changes to their products year-on-year. “These days, updates to mobile phones are mostly incremental from a hardware perspective,” says Wood. “Last year’s iPhone will likely look very similar to this year’s, albeit with a slightly bigger screen, slightly better camera and perhaps better battery life. That’s quite a contrast to the mid-1990s to 2007, when there was an unbelievable acceleration in performance and capability of mobile phones.” All eyes on AI The adoption of AI into the iPhone – which Apple trailed at its worldwide developers conference (WWDC) in June – could be considered a step change in how the iPhone works. But there may not be a huge hankering to use ChatGPT on your phone, as I explained for in a contentious comment piece in June. Lest you think I’m just a pessimistic, jaded tech reporter, market analysts are with me. Wood believes AI has become a “battleground” between Google (which has Gemini), Samsung (which is touting its Galaxy AI), and Apple (which understood the assignment, and cannily branded its version as Apple Intelligence, trying to make its name synonymous with the tech). Will all the investment to put AI into their phones is worth it? “I’m not convinced it will move the needle much on overall sales of new devices,” he says. Besides, Apple has already said European users won’t be getting integrated AI on its devices this year because the company isn’t sure it can do so without breaching Digital Markets Act rules in the European Union. There is one exception to that: it will be accessible in the UK, which is of course no longer in the EU, come December. But if you spend much time on the continent it won’t be usable there. So you’re paying for marginal updates, and the potential lure of AI at some yet-to-be-determined point. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it This is where I make an embarrassing admission: despite covering the latest whizz-bang technology, I don’t see the point in keeping up with the latest hardware. I’m not an Apple fanboy, though I do use my iPad – a seventh generation one, released in September 2019 and discontinued a year later – every day. It works, and it works well, even though it’s five years old. That’s in part because, with few exceptions, Apple’s annual hardware updates tinker around the edges. Does it actually matter if my news app renders a little crisper thanks to a fancier screen, or apps open a millisecond quicker thanks to a marginally faster processor? And if it does, do those marginal benefits justify the cost of a new device? My phone is the same: when I dropped my years old Samsung two months ago and needed to replace it after a screen repair damaged the keyboard, I elected to buy a similarly out-of-date phone: a 2021 Samsung A52. I chose it because it was the latest model I could find at a semi-affordable price that still had a 3.5mm headphone jack, a technology I cling to because Bluetooth headphones have given us nothing but the agony of lost earbuds and having to listen to other people’s music on public transport. I’d argue the new iPhone is a lot of money for not a whole lot of new stuff. Still: you may disagree. And if you do, please let me know – you can find me on X at @stokel.

                    "headline": "Apple reveals iPhone 16 and ‘Apple Intelligence’ AI features",
                    "bodyText": "Apple sought to pitch the latest generation of iPhones as machines built around artificial intelligence as its biggest product event of the year, as the tech giant seeks a dominant position in the aggressive race around the technology. The company claimed iPhone 16, the smartphone’s new model, had been designed “from the ground up” for its “Apple Intelligence” range of AI features, which include the ability to generate and edit text to fit certain tones, as well as use the device’s camera to recognize real-world objects. The event – held at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California – featured the tagline “It’s glowtime”, with the company’s logo surrounded by a colorful aura. Through a series of high-production videos, the company’s executives advertised a range of new hardware, and tried to highlight the ways Apple was integrating AI into its products. “We are thrilled to introduce the first iPhones designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, and its breakthrough capabilities,” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in a prerecorded video during the event. The company’s “Apple Intelligence” system will allow iPhones to perform a range of tasks that include photo editing, using the camera to identify objects in the real world and generating text. During a segment promoting Apple Intelligence, the company promised an ability to create custom emojis based solely on prompts like “cowboy frog”. The AI features will also allow users to search through photos, emails and texts through typing in descriptions or giving audio commands to the Siri voice assistant. The company will provide its AI integrations for US English language users as a free software update next month. Apple’s shares fell slightly, around 1%, following the event. The new iPhone 16 also promised a “bold new palette” of colors and a more resilient display screen. It introduces an “action button” to the phone that can perform customizable activities, as well as a new A18 chip intended to provide better performance. Apple also rolled out a new version of its AirPod headphones during the event, and a new design for the Apple Watch that included a larger screen and faster charging, as well as health app features, like sleep monitoring. The AirPods Pro 2 will also now have the ability to function as a hearing aid for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Apple’s fall product launch has become one of the company’s most important annual events as it typically showcases a series of new devices and sets the tone for the holiday shopping season, Apple’s busiest and most profitable period. These new products are routinely the cause of immense speculation inside the tech industry and among the company’s fans. In the lead-up to the event, reports around Apple switching from LCD to OLED screens, and rumors of a dedicated photo button circulated widely. Early coverage of the event also predicted that the tech giant would expand on its AI “Apple Intelligence” features. Earlier this year at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the company announced a range of ways that it intended to integrate AI features into its products and services. One of the biggest reveals was a partnership with OpenAI to merge ChatGPT technology with Apple’s Siri voice assistant, with executives promising a more “natural” mode of interaction. Apple’s announcements at its WWDC event and promises to include more artificial intelligence were a pivot for the company after it held off longer than competitors such as Microsoft in debuting consumer-facing AI tools. The company’s hesitancy to roll out new generative AI features had previously been a source of frustration for investors and analysts awaiting the company’s release of its own take on the technology. Apple’s share price has risen considerably this year as market enthusiasm for generative AI and revenue growth has buoyed big tech stocks. The company has struggled with a global downturn in smartphone sales in recent years, however, as well as the rise of rivals such as Huawei in key markets, particularly China. Huawei is expected to release its own line of new products within hours of Apple’s event. Also looming in the background is the Department of Justice’s sprawling antitrust lawsuit against Apple, which alleges that the company built and maintained an illegal monopoly over the smartphone market. Apple has rejected the allegations in the case, which could take years to be decided."

                    "bodyText": "PS: Investment bank ABN Amro have just published their “initial take” on Draghi’s competitiveness report. They point out that the “ambitious proposals” are effectively a plan for the future of EU integration. The call for common eurozone debt will be a political hot potato too, while Draghi’s points about mis-aligned government policies are well made. Here’s what ABN Amro say: Ambitious proposals are no less than a blueprint for the future of EU integration Former ECB president and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi’s long-awaited report on competitiveness was finally unveiled this morning, and it was unexpectedly substantial and concrete in its proposals. The report tackles a host of critical competitiveness issues facing Europe, from energy and decarbonisation, to lowering regulatory and other barriers for high-innovating tech unicorns (which typically move to the US to achieve sufficient scale), to strengthening industrial capacity (which also has implications for defence – a topic of increasing geopolitical importance). Its flagship proposal is for €800bn in additional EU investment annually, to be partly funded by the common issuance of new common debt. Crucially, the case for common debt issuance rests not only on financing need, but also to “make the [Capital Markets Union] much easier to achieve and more complete,” by: 1) facilitating the uniform pricing of corporate bonds, 2) providing a safe collateral instrument for member states, 3) a “large, liquid market” for global investors “enhancing the role of the euro as a reserve currency.” The proposals face an uphill political struggle, to put it mildly In the press conference accompanying the report, European Commission president Von der Leyen was immediately asked for her views on the call for new common debt issuance. Her response was understandably neutral, given the political sensitivity of the topic. She stated that the first priority was to identify the ‘common projects’ where member states could cooperate, and then decide whether these should be financed through higher contributions or through ‘new own resources’. When Draghi himself was pressed on this topic, he pointed to the possibility of using the EU’s enhanced cooperation mechanism – or even a separate intergovernmental agreement outside the EU structures – to allow a ‘coalition of the willing’ to forge ahead on debt issuance if unanimity could not be achieved on the issue. Given the political momentum of populist, anti-EU parties at present (see also here), the environment is hardly conducive to the proposals being adopted as they are. A memorable moment in the press conference came when a journalist asked if the report represented a ‘do or die’ moment for the EU; Draghi responded it was rather a ‘do, or slow agony’. Typically, crises are needed to push EU integration forward, and it could be that the ‘slow agony’ of the EU’s competitiveness problem will not be enough to galvanise the political will to overcome it. But there is much more to the report than common debt While this was the most headline-grabbing proposal, the report made many pertinent observations with less controversial, actionable measures. For instance, in the press conference Draghi pointed out that the mandate to phase out internal combustion engine cars was not accompanied by investment in energy infrastructure to support the roll-out of EVs. Or the fact that energy taxation in Europe is relatively high as well as uneven across member states, aggravating the impact of the rise in wholesale energy prices. Policy goals are often misaligned and even compete with one another, with decarbonisation an impediment to growth rather than the growth impulse that it could be. Time for a recap: The EU should fear for its self-preservation as it faces a “slow and agonising decline”, according to a hard-hitting report by the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi that calls for an €800bn-a-year spending boost to end years of stagnation. Warning that the Covid pandemic and Ukraine war had changed the rules of international trade to the EU’s detriment, he said the bloc needed additional investment of €750bn-€800bn a year – equivalent to 5% of the EU’s annual economic output – to build a more resilient economy and regain previously high rates of productivity growth. “We are already in crisis mode and to ignore this is to slide into a situation you don’t want to have,” said Draghi, who is also a former head of the European Central Bank. In a wide-ranging report, Draghi said Europe should start regularly issuing “common safe assets” to fund joint investment projects among Member States, co-ordinate better on defence spending, and improve its access to raw materials. And in a stark warning, he said: “We have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the cold war we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation.” German economy minister Robert Habeck welcomed the proposal, saying: “The whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.” But, the Dutch government cautioned that public investments must not be seen as an “end in themselves.” In a gloomy day for European economic news: Swedish manufacturer Northvolt is to cut a large number of jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses. Germany has entered a three-quarter-long recession, according to investment bank Nomura Elsewhere today…. In the financial markets, shares have rallied in New York and across Europe, following losses on Friday when the latest US jobs report came in below forecasts. The UK is missing out on billions of pounds of revenue each year from small retail businesses that exploit weaknesses in government systems to evade paying tax, the public spending watchdog has warned. Aldi has said the price of a basket of its goods is lower than a year ago despite ongoing grocery inflation, as the discount chain tries to fight back against increasing pressure from rivals’ price-matching schemes. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a £150m joint venture with the government body Homes England that will lead to the UK’s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour’s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The Bank of London, the fledgling clearing bank backed by the Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, has announced it has raised another £42m from investors days after being hit by a winding-up order by tax authorities. The oil and gas supermajor BP is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the decision-making of its engineers, after signing a five-year deal with the US spy technology company Palantir. Japanese bank Nomura has a worrying prediction – they believe Germany has entered a three-quarters-long recession. It would be a relatively shallow downturn, though – Nomura predict a 0.4 percentage point drop in GDP, followed by stagnation. We already know that Germany shrank slightly in April-June; Nomura predict this contraction will continue. They say: Q2 2024 GDP growth contracted against expectations, with the expenditure breakdown indicating that the decline in domestic demand was more pronounced than expected. Official data suggest that Q3 is off to a poor start; July factory sales and industrial output fell materially, with August manufacturing surveys indicating further deterioration. Services surveys, too, have materially weakened in Q3 thus far relative to Q2. Germany’s recession, in addition to France’s stagnation, will weigh on euro area GDP growth, they predict – while the eurozone periphery will likely outperform due to tourism. Kim Fausing, President and CEO of Danish multinational company Danfoss, has welcomed Mario Draghi’s report into Europe’s competitiveness failings: Fausing says: “Europe is falling behind and we need to shift gears. That’s why I welcome Mr Draghi’s report today and his call for a new industrial strategy for Europe. We’ve known for some time that productivity in the EU is lagging behind other key markets, contributing to a decline in competitiveness. When you look at a list of 44 so-called critical technologies, Europe is not a leader in a single one. The Draghi report rightly points out that EU companies still face electricity prices that are 2-3 times those in the US and that natural gas prices paid are 4-5 times higher. This impacts production costs, and thereby also competitiveness. Fausing remains “a stubborn optimist” when it comes to Europe’s future, but agrees that a change of mindset is needed – including a new industrial policy: We must step up and drive momentum by investing in innovation and focusing on Competitive Decarbonization. That is decarbonizing industries while making them more resilient and increasing economic competitiveness. I see a lot of momentum among industry leaders, and European companies have enormous potential if we get the right political framework and double down on energy efficiency, electrification and renewables. What I am calling for is an active, forward-looking industrial policy, which has a focus on implementation and follow-up that can create growth. Only by working together can we turn this around, ensure Europe takes a leading position in key sectors, and create high-quality jobs.” Back in London, the FTSE 100 continues to rally. It’s now up 71 points or 0.87% at 8252 points, more than recovering all of Friday’s drop. That’s despite analysts at UBS downgrading their view on UK shares to Neutral from Most Preferred. In a research note this morning, UBS says there are several reasons to be positive about UK equities – including the return of political stability, last month’s interest rate cut by the Bank of England, and a likely return to earnings growth this year. Another advantage – UK stocks still suffer from “undemanding valuations”, with shares trading at a lower price/earnings ratio than the long-running average. So what’s the problem? UBS analyst Dean Turner reckons these positive developments seem to be “largely priced in”, adding: ….which suggests that UK equities will struggle to outperform their international peers in what we expect to be a positive year-end for stocks Turner does predict UK stocks will keep rallying, pushing the FTSE to rise to around 9,000 by year-end. That would be a new alltime high (the previous best was 8,474 points back in May). Over on Wall Street, shares have opened higher as investors try to put Friday’s wobble behind them: Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 228 points or 0.57% at 40,574 points S&amp;P 500 share index: up 42 points or 0.8% at 5,451 points Nasdaq Composite, up 168 points or 1% at 16,858 points. Lucas Guttenberg, senior advisor at Bertelsmann Stiftung, says Mario Dragihi’s report is “surprisingly good” – indeed, better than another report from another former Italian PM, Enrico Letta, into “the future of the single market”. Over in Berlin, German economy minister Robert Habeck has vooiced support for Mario Draghi’s proposals. Habeck says he agrees that the European Union needed massive investment, comprehensive reforms and strengthened resilience. He said: “The whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.” “Defence” appears 90 times in Mario Draghi’s report into Europe’s competitiveness. Daniel Fiott, head of the defence and statecraft programme at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy, has summarised the main points: The Dutch government have given a slightly lukewarm response to Mario Draghi’s proposals to fix Europe’s competitiveness problems. Amsterdam says it agrees with some of Draghi’s ideas, but also cautions that public investments must not be seen as an “end in themselves.” In remarks sent to Reuters by the Economic Affairs ministry, a spokesperson said the Netherlands was still studying the former European Central Bank chief’s new report but that it agreed with the need for more integrated European policy and less “regulatory burden”. The Netherlands’ conservative government has a reference in its governing pact that it does not support creating new instruments for sharing debt at the European level. European lithium-ion battery maker Northvolt is an illustration of the problems Mario Draghi is concerned about. Northvolt is to cut jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses, the Financial Times reports, as it tries to ride out problems in Europe’s move to electric cars. The company has decided to pause its cathode active material production, selling one site and buying instead from Chinese or Korean companies, the FT says. This will help it focus on first gigafactory in northern Sweden, which began production in 2021. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s co-founder and chief executive, has explained: “Building a battery company from scratch is a profoundly capital-intensive and challenging endeavour. We have come a long way . . .  Now it’s time to focus on the core, to learn from the past and to scale up our core business to make sure that we can meet our customers’ expectations and to help Europe achieve a sustainable battery ecosystem, Europe also needs to take steps to increase and secures its access to critical raw materials (CRMs), today’s competition report says. Those CRMs include metals used in clean energy technologies such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. China is the single largest processer of nickel, copper, lithium and cobalt, the report says, pointing to Beijing’s “willingness to use its market power”: Export restrictions from the country grew by a factor of nine between 2009 and 2020. Little progress is being made so far with diversification. Europe, the report concludes, is “falling behind” in the global race to secure supply chains: Alongside its dominant position in processing and refining, China is actively investing in mining assets in Africa and Latin America and overseas refining via its Belt and Road initiative. Its overseas investment in metals and mining through the Belt and Road Initiative reached a record high of $10bn in the first half of 2023 alone, and it plans to double the ownership of overseas mines containing critical minerals by Chinese companies. The US has deployed the IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and defence funding to develop at scale domestic processing, refining and recycling capacity, as well as using its geopolitical power to secure the global supply chain. Japan is highly dependent on other regions for CRMs, and since the 2000s it has developed a strategic approach to increase access to overseas mining projects. The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security invests equity in mining and refining assets around the world, manages strategic stockpiling and, since the introduction of the recent economic security law, has powers to develop processing and refining facilities within Japan. Europe, by contrast, has a comparable level of dependencies, being highly dependent on one or two countries for most of its critical mineral imports. However, it is not following a similarly coordinated approach. The EU is lacking a comprehensive strategy covering all stages of the supply chain (from exploration to recycling) and, unlike its competitors, the mining and trading of commodities is largely left to private actors and the market. A key message running though Mario Draghi’s report into Europe’s competitiveness problems is that member states need to bolster their collective efforts and work together better. That includes combining its spending power, winning foreign direct investment together, and using its bargaining power to negotiate cheaper energy. But the most controversial part of the report could be the suggestion that Europe should start regularly issuing “common safe assets” to fund joint investment projects among Member States and to help integrate capital markets. That would be a step towards eurobonds, in which member states issue collective debt. Eurobonds were proposed as a solution to Europe’s debt crisis over a decade ago – the problem is that wealthier, more frugal Northern European countries fear being responsible for debt issued for their Southern neighbours. The economic crisis in Germany, though, may mean those fears are less strong. Some collective EU debt has already been issued in recent years, under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) project to fund the recovery from the pandemic. Draghi’s report suggests the NGEU model can be “built on”, to issue common debt instruments, to finance “joint investment projects that will increase the EU’s competitiveness and security”. On defence, Mario Draghi argues that EU members must “join forces” to help European manufacturers. His report says points out that the EU is collectively the world’s second largest military spender – but only a fifth of that money goes to EU companies: European collaborative procurement accounted for less than a fifth of spending on defence equipment procurement in 2022. We also do not favour competitive European defence companies. Between mid-2022 and mid-2023, 78% of total procurement spending went to non-EU suppliers, out of which 63% went to the US. The competition report also flags that the “prolonged period of peace in Europe and the US security umbrella” has allowed countries to cut defence spending (to fund other commitments). Now, only ten Member States now spend more than or equal to 2% of GDP in line with NATO commitments, although defence expenditures are rising…. Skimming though Mario Draghi’s report, there’s a stark warning that Europe’s position in the advanced technologies that will drive future growth is declining. It poounts out that only four of the world’s top 50 tech companies are European and the EU’s share of global tech revenues dropped from 22% to 18% between 2013 and 2023, while the US share rose from 30% to 38%. The report says: Technological change is accelerating rapidly. Europe largely missed out on the digital revolution led by the internet and the productivity gains it brought: in fact, the productivity gap between the EU and the US is largely explained by the tech sector. The EU is weak in the emerging technologies that will drive future growth. Only four of the world’s top 50 tech companies are European. The Draghi report shows clearly how Europe’s weak productivity growth has led to slower income growth and weaker domestic demand in Europe. On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000, it says. The report says: EU economic growth has been persistently slower than in the US over the past two decades, while China has been rapidly catching up. This chart shows how Europe’s economy has struggled to keep up with both the US and China since 2002: You can read Mario Draghi’s new report into Europe’s economic problems here: The future of European competitiveness It explains that to digitalise and decarbonise the economy and increase defence capacity, the investment share in Europe will have to rise by around 5 percentage points of GDP. That would take it back to levels last seen in the 1960s and 70s. And it’s much, much larger than the Marshall Plan – which between 1948-51 amounted to around 1-2% of GDP annually. The report declares firmly that Europe faces an existential challenge, saying: If Europe cannot become more productive, we will be forced to choose. We will not be able to become, at once, a leader in new technologies, a beacon of climate responsibility and an independent player on the world stage. We will not be able to finance our social model. We will have to scale back some, if not all, of our ambitions. And in an eye-catching warning to European policymakers, the report warns that if the EU cannot deliver “prosperity, equity, freedom, peace and democracy” then it will have lost its reason for being. Onto questions… Q: Are the EU’s rules on mergers holding back competition? Mario Draghi says his report says competition policy should consider “innovation”, and “resilience”. It also proposes changes to the EU’s state aid rules, saying: State aid should be used for projects of common interests, and commonly funded, cross-border projects But it should be stopped for other things, as it fragments the single market. The report also recommends that competition decisions are made more ‘forward looking’, rather than being ‘prudential’, and also recommends faster decisions on competition law. Draghi adds that he is confident that “in our unity we will find the strength to reform”. Ad then he hands his weighty report onto the President of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen. Mario Draghi then warns reporters in Brussels that Europe faces very serious challenges. Explaining the importance of taking the steps outlined in his new report, Draghi says: We have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the Cold War we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation. Draghi touches on the question of how such massive spending is possible. He says it is unlikely that private investment alone can finance it alone – without destabilising the EU economy. So, some form of common funding, and joint safe asset, will be needed. The third part of Draghi’s report looks at increasing security and reducing dependencies. That includes economic dependencies – as the raw materials Europe needs are in the hands of a few suppliers…. …and also security dependencies, even though geopolitics have “significantly worsened” in the last 10 years. Draghi’s solution – Europe must develop a “foreign economic policy”. That means…. Cordinating preferential trade agreements and direct investments with resource-rich countries, building up stockpiles in selected critical areas, and creating industrial partnerships to secure the supply chain for key technologies. And, we need to build our defence industrial capacity. Draghi concedes that these goals are not new – member states are doing this on their own. But they are punching ‘under our power’ – Europe coould be more effective if it combined its resources and coordinated policies, he argues. Europe must also increase the supply of clean energy, Mario Draghi adds. He cites Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as an example of how incentives can be used to stimulate development of green technologies. China’s state sponsored competition is a threat to developing the European clean energy sector, he says. Draghi’s second recommendation is that Europe must combine “decarbonisation with competitiveness.” He says decarbonisation is an opportunity for growth, but one that could be missed if European countries fail to coordinate. Draghi says Europe needs a plan to decouples the price of fossil fuels from clean energy sources, so consumers see benefits from decarbonisation in their bills. [currently, fossil fuels are still the main power plants “at the margin”, and hence often set the wholesale electricity price in Europe – as this paper explains]. Europe’s problem is not that it lacks smart people, or good ideas, Mario Draghi continues. The problem, he argues, is that there are too many barriers to commercial innovations, and to scaling them up. Draghi then points out that since 2008, 30% of unicorns - tech firms that grow to become worth over €1bn – which started in the EU have left. The majority went to the US, Draghi adds: 30% of our most succesful innovators have moved, and this has to change. Europe must become a place where innovation flourishes, especially for digital tech. A weak tech sector will rob Europe of the growth opportunities of the AI revolution, and also hamper companies in the rest of the economy too, he warns. Mario Draghi then outlines the steps Europe must take – starting with closing the innovation gap with the United States. Innovation is the first pillar of the report, he explains, citing Europe’s failure to keep up with Big Tech firms. Giving a gloomy assessment of the situation, Draghi says: Europe is nowaways stuck in a static industrial structure, populated by mid-technology companies which are already mature. The leading firms in research and investment spending are the same ones we had 20 year ago – our cars. Draghi adds that it was the same picture in the US 20 years ago- where their big R&amp;D spenders were \"autos and pharma”. Now, though, it’s all digital at the top, Draghi adds. Over in Brussels, Mario Draghi is calling for coordinated industrial policy and a huge increase in investment to improve the economic situation in the European Union and lift competitiveness. Draghi, the former European Central Bank chief and Italian prime minister, is presenting a new report on the future of EU competitiveness, which he has been working on for the last year. In it, he calls for a much more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment to stop Europe falling further behind the US and China. Draghi says that Europe needs to boost its investment by up to five percentage points of GDP – or up to €800bn a year - and much closer coordination between European countries to ensure the money is spent effectively. Draghi says his report proposes a “new industrial strategy for Europe”, and is granular with 170 different topline proposals. Speaking in Brussels now, Draghi warns that Europe’s productivity is “weak, very weak”, and point out that growth has been slowing down for a long time. World trade is slowing, and become less open to European countries, Draghi says, adding that Europe has also lost its main supplier of cheap energy, Russia. Also, it needs to invest more in defence, for the first time since second world war. Another hurdle, Draghi adds, is that this is the first year that Europe cannot count on population growth to lift growth. Draghi’s report is likely to influence the debate on EU competitiveness, one of the priorities of the next European Commission, which is due to take office later this year. Introducing Draghi, EC president Ursula von der Leyen said there is a “wide consensus” that the issue of improving Europe’s competitiveness must be “at the top of our agenda and at the heart of our action”. Investor morale across the euro area has fallen for the third month in a row. The Sentix Investor Confidence Index has dropped to -15.4 this month, down from -13.9 in August, and lower than forecast. Sentix warns that the eurozone economy is “threatening to tip into recession”, and blames the economic problems in Germany. It says: The eurozone is struggling with dangerous recessionary tendencies ‘thanks to Germany’. The situation in the rest of the world is also weakening, but investors here are somewhat more optimistic in their expectations. Germany is on the brink of recession after its GDP shrank in the second quarter of this year. Its economy has been hit by high energy costs since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its car sector has struggled to cope with competition from cheaper Chinese-built electric vehicles. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a £150m joint venture with the government body Homes England, that will lead to the UK’s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour’s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The combined venture, known as the MADE Partnership, will oversee multiple large-scale projects, including town extensions, new garden village-style communities and brownfield developments, each made up of 1,000 to 100,000 homes and community facilities. The government’s housing and regeneration body, Homes England, said the partnership would “ have the finance, tools, expertise and partners required to ensure a cohesive approach to delivering a fabulous place that people want to live and work”. The venture will initially be backed by up to £150m in funding, provided by Barratt, Homes England and Lloyds, which will hold equal equity stakes. But while MADE has described as a “long-term partnership”, the announcement of its launch on Monday did not included any timescale or housebuilding targets. We also have worrying signs that the US jobs market is cooling. The latest UK Report on Jobs from KPMG and REC shows that the UK labour market softened in August, with vacancies falling for both permanent and temporary staff. The number of permanent staff positions fell at the fastest rate since March, for the 23rd month in a row, with reports of “reduced demand amongst companies for new staff”. This has led to a slowdown in earnings growth – permanent salaries meanwhile continued to rise, but at the weakest pace since March. Pay for temporary positions rose at the weakest pace for three-and-a-half years. Bad news for workers – but it may cheer the Bank of England, as it looks for signs that inflationary pressures have eased. Jon Holt, chief executive and Senior Partner of KPMG in the UK, suggests the gloomy tone from the new Labour government may be deterring firms from taking on staff. Holt explains: “Recent Government warnings that the UK’s economy may weaken further before improving add to the overall sense of uncertainty, affecting recruitment plans. Firms holding back from hiring led to a sharp contraction in the number of people placed into permanent roles in August amid continued decline in demand, extending the downturn in the UK’s labour market. “The news that while salaries rose last month it was at the weakest rate since March could help make the case for more rate cuts when the [Bank of England’s] Monetary Policy Committee meets to decide the future path of interest rates. A second survey from accountancy firm BDO also shows the UK jobs market weakening. BDO’s employment index has fallen for the fourteenth consecutive month, to its lowest reading since January 2013. BDO says: This reflects ongoing concerns in the job market, including falling job vacancies and more people claiming unemployment-related benefits, which reached its highest level since December 2021 according to the Office for National Statistics. Elsewhere in the airline industry, Boeing may have struck a deal to avoid a strike which would have added to its list of problems. Boeing said yesterday it has reached a tentative agreement with a union representing more than 32,000 workers in the US Pacific Northwest. The proposed four-year contract includes a general wage increase of 25%, a commitment to build the next commercial airplane in the Seattle area, and better retirement benefits. If ratified by Boeing factory workers near Seattle and Portland on Thursday, the deal could help avert a possible crippling strike set for as early as 13 September. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 called it “the best contract we’ve negotiated in our history”. The deal also gived the union greater input in the safety and quality of Boeing’s production system – an area in the spotlight following the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, and the loss of a cabin panel in a midair blowout. In the airline industry, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has issued a fresh call for the chief executive of air traffic control (ATC) provider Nats to resign. O’Leary urged Martin Rolfe to step down and “allow someone competent” to take over after flights were disrupted at Gatwick Airport on Sunday due to “Nats staff shortages”. The Ryanair chief declared: “UK Nats staff shortages caused multiple flight delays and cancellations at Gatwick Airport yesterday, Sunday September 8. “This is the latest in a long line of cock-ups by UK Nats, which has yet again disrupted multiple flights and thousands of passengers at Gatwick. Airlines and passengers deserve better. “Ryanair again calls on UK Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and allow someone competent to run an efficient UK ATC service, which airlines and passengers are entitled to expect. “If he won’t go, then (new Transport Secretary) Louise Haigh should sack him.” Nats was hit by criticism last year, when a single piece of rogue data in a flight plan caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, and when staff illness forced flights to be grounded at Gatwick: The pound has slipped to its lowest level in nearly a week this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.3095, the first time it’s been below $1.31 since last Tuesday. Stocks are rebounding in London at the start of trading, after the worst week of 2024 so far. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is up 49 points, or 0.6%, at 8230 points – clawing back over three-quarters of Friday’s fall. Gambling firm Entain is the top riser, up 5.6%, after reporting online revenue growth ahead of expectations this morning. Banks and mining companies are also among the risers. But luxury group Burberry is a rare faller, down 1.5%. Luxury stocks have been hit recently by concerns that China’s economic recovery was faltering; Burberry is already being ejected from the FTSE 100 in the next reshuffle. Economic slowdown worries hit the oil price last week, sending it to its lowest level in almost 18 months. This morning, though, Brent crude has gained almost 1%, rising to $71.10 per barrel. This is partly due to concerns over a potential hurricane system approaching the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could possibly cause disruption to supplies. A weather system in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday. The U.S. Gulf Coast accounts for some 60% of U.S. refining capacity, Reuters reports. However, Morgan Stanley has cut its forecast for oil prices in the final quarter of this year. It now predicts Brent crude will average $75 a barrel in October-December, down from an earlier projection of $80/barrel. Aldi’s UK boss has also revealed that its shoppers are treating themselves to more expensive products as cost of living pressures start to ease. The supermarket reports that customers are “trading up” to its premium own-label products such as Wagyu steak, premium cheese, ready meals, brioche buns and smoked salmon. Aldi UK chief executive Giles Hurley has told the BBC: “It’s still tough out there for millions of families but inflationary pressures are easing for some. “For others, it’ll be a decision not to use hospitality but to celebrate at home instead.” Aldi is to open a further 23 stores this year after profits more than doubled last year to almost £537m. The supermarket has just announced it would invest £800m in the UK market through the rest of this year including opening 23 more stores, and had signed a £750m deal with Kent-based grower AC Goatham &amp; Son including establishing the first ever ‘Aldi Orchard’ on a 200-acre plot on New Green Farm in Gravesend dedicated to growing fruit for the chain. The supermarket – which opened about 30 stores last year – said sales increased 16% to £17.9bn in 2023, its highest ever period of sales growth. However, since then sales growth has slowed as all the traditional grocers, including Tesco and Sainsbury’s, have introduced schemes to price match Aldi on key items. The group will open about 30 stores again this year in total, down from about 50 per annum in the years before 2023. The retailer, which currently has over 1,000 stores, has previously announced plans to scale to 1,500 stores across the UK. The retailer, which aims to be the cheapest in the UK, said it had invested almost £100m in over 300 price cuts in the last three months on items including fish goujons, chicken breasts, potatoes and basmati rice. Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: “For every £1 of profit generated last year, we’re investing £2 this year - opening more stores and building the supply infrastructure to bring high-quality, affordable groceries to millions more families the length and breadth of Britain.” Chinese producers continue to slash their prices, new data today shows, in a sign of weak demand. China’s producer price index (PPI) – which tracks prices at the factory gate – fell by 1.8% in August compared with a year earlier. That’s the largest fall in four months, and a bigger decline than expected – which will add to concerns over the health of the global economy. Junyu Tan, North Asia Economist at Coface, explains: “The ongoing deflationary pressures boil down into a broader problem of production surplus, which is still outstripping demand.” However, this did not immediately feed through to consumers’ pockets. China’s headline CPI inflation rate rose to 0.6% in the year to August, up from 0.5% in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Here we go again (again). Investors are experiencing another bout of angst over the health of the US economy, creating a chilly feel in the markets. Spirits are low after Friday’s disappointing US employment report, which showed that fewer jobs were created last month than hoped. Non-farm payrolls rose by just 142,000 in August, while the payrolls for June and July were slashed, leaving traders fretting that the US jobs market – and the wider economy – was cooling. In better news, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.2% – but the report overall has left investors baffled as to how the US Federal Reserve will react. An interest rate cut later this month feels inked in – but will it be a gentle quarter-percentage point (25 basis points) reduction, or a dramatic half-point cut? Instinctively, investors would like a larger cut in borrowing costs – except, if that happens, it implies the Fed has serious concerns over the health of the US economy. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: For traders, this means more of the Fed’s favourite guessing game. The report wasn’t bad enough to scream “panic mode,” but indeed not good enough to keep the 50 bp rate cut whispers at bay. The problem? This delicate balancing act leaves everyone wondering: will the Fed take a cautious 25 bps step, or does a bigger 50 bps cut suddenly feel more necessary? One thing’s for sure: whatever the Fed does, the markets are left doing the one thing they hate most—waiting in uncertainty. And we can see the impact of this in the markets. On Friday, the US S&amp;P 500 share index fell by 1.7%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite tumbled by 2.5%. This has knocked Asia-Pacific markets today, where China’s main stock indices are down over 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng is down almost 2%, and the South Korean Kospi index is off 0.7%. Disappointing economic growth figures from Japan have added to the gloom; Japan’s Q2 GDP growth rate has been revised down to an annualised rate of 2.9% for April-June, down from a preliminary estimate of 3.1%. Japan’s Nikkei share index began the session with a 3% drop, but actually managed to claw its way back to finish 0.5% lower. European markets, which fell on Friday, are set for a slightly higher open: The agenda 9.30am BST: TUC Annual congress in Brighton 9.30am BST: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence"

                    "bodyText": "For several hours a week, I write for a technology company worth billions of dollars. Alongside me are published novelists, rising academics and several other freelance journalists. The workload is flexible, the pay better than we are used to, and the assignments never run out. But what we write will never be read by anyone outside the company. That’s because we aren’t even writing for people. We are writing for an AI. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have made it possible to automate huge swaths of linguistic life, from summarising any amount of text to drafting emails, essays and even entire novels. These tools appear so good at writing that they have become synonymous with the very idea of artificial intelligence. But before they ever risk leading to a godlike superintelligence or devastating mass unemployment, they first need training. Instead of using these grandiloquent chatbots to automate us out of our livelihoods, tech companies are contracting us to help train their models. The core part of the job is writing pretend responses to hypothetical chatbot questions. This is the training data that the model needs to be fed. The “AI” needs an example of what “good” looks like before it can try to produce “good” writing. As well as providing our model with such “gold standard” material, we are also helping it attempt to avoid “hallucinating” – a poetic term for telling lies. We do so by feeding it examples that use a search engine and cite sources. Without seeing writing that does this, it cannot learn to do so by itself. Without better language data, these language models simply cannot improve. Their world is our word. Hold on. Aren’t these machines trained on billions and billions of words and sentences? What would they need us fleshy scribes for? Well, for starters, the internet is finite. And so too is the sum of every word on every page of every book ever written. So what happens when the last pamphlet, papyrus and prolegomenon have been digitised and the model is still not perfect? What happens when we run out of words? The date for that linguistic apocalypse has already been set. Researchers announced in June that we can expect this to take place between 2026 and 2032 “if current LLM development trends continue”. At that point, “Models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data.” Note the word human. Large language models do little but produce prose, much of which is already being published on the internet. So couldn’t we train these models on their own output (so-called synthetic data)? Our cyborg internet – co-authored by us and our word machines – could then swell ad infinitum. No such luck. Training our current large language models on their own output doesn’t work. “Indiscriminately learning from data produced by other models causes ‘model collapse’ – a degenerative process whereby, over time, models forget the true underlying data distribution,” write Ilia Shumailov and colleagues in Nature. In other words, they go off the rails and tend towards producing nonsense. Feeding something its own effluvia leads to atrophy. Who would have thought? Shumailov explained to me that each time a model is trained on synthetic data, it loses awareness of the long tail of “minority data” that it was originally trained on (rare words, unusual facts etc). The breadth of knowledge is eroded and replaced by only the most likely datapoints – LLMs are at their core sophisticated text-prediction machines. So when your original, digital data is already biased – very English language-heavy, largely US-centric, and full of unreliable forum posts – this bias will only be repeated. If synthetic, AI-produced data is insufficient to help improve the models, then they will need something else. This is especially true as concerns spread that the much-vaunted models will stop being able to improve before they’ve ever become that useful. Leading startup investment firm Sequoia has shown that AI firms will need to fill a $500bn revenue gap by the end of this year to keep investors satisfied. The word machines might be hungry; the capital behind them also has an appetite. OpenAI, the trillion-dollar Microsoft protectorate behind ChatGPT, recently signed licensing agreements – potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars – with many of the world’s main media organisations, from News Corp to the Financial Times. But it’s not just a question of accumulating more original words. These companies need the sort of writing that the model will seek to emulate, not merely absorb. That’s where human annotators come in. *** In Fritz Lang’s classic 1927 film Metropolis, the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch is reincarnated as an insatiable industrial machine. It is a technology that works us, as opposed to working for us. Factory workers respond to its ever-growing demands by lunging at its dials and pulling at its levers. But they cannot keep up. The machine hisses and explodes. We then see the workers forgoing the act of feeding and walking straight into the furnace mouth of Moloch themselves. When I first took the role as an AI annotator, or more precisely as a “senior data quality specialist”, I was very aware of the irony of my situation. Large language models were supposed to automate writers’ jobs. The better they became through our work, the quicker our careers would decline. And so there I was, feeding our very own Moloch. Indeed, if there is anything these models can achieve quite well, it is the sort of digital copywriting that many freelance writers perform to pay the bills. Writing an SEO blog about the “internet of things” might not take much research, pride or skill; but it usually pays far better than poetry. Working for an AI company as a writer was therefore a little like being told you were going to be paid a visit by Dracula, and instead of running for the hills, you stayed in and laid the table. But our destroyer is generous, the pay sufficient to justify the alienation. If our sector was going up in smoke, we might as well get high off the fumes. And therein lies the ultimate irony. Here is a new economic phenomenon that rewards writing, that encourages it, that truly values it; all while simultaneously deeming it an encumbrance, a problem to be solved, an inefficiency to be automated away. It is like being paid to write in sand, to whisper secrets into a slab of butter. Even if our words could make a dent, we wouldn’t ever be able to recognise it. But perhaps it is foolish to be precious about so prosaic a craft. How many people deserve to make a real dent, after all? François Chollet, a bestselling computer science textbook author and the creator of the Keras training library (which provides building blocks for researchers to create their own deep learning models), told me he estimates there are “probably about 20,000 people employed full-time just creating annotated data to train large language models”. Without manual human work, he says the models’ output would be “really, really bad”. The goal of the annotation work that I and others perform is to provide gold-standard examples for the model to learn from and emulate. It’s a step up from the sorts of annotation work we’ve all done in the past, even unknowingly. If ever you’ve been faced with a “captcha” problem asking you to prove you aren’t a robot – eg “select all the tiles with pictures of a traffic light” – you were actually doing unpaid work for a machine, by helping to teach it to “see”. When I was a student I remember repeating words like “left” and “right” into my laptop for a couple of hours straight, in order to help the developers of a self-driving car. After a few hours being paid per satisfactory vocal delivery, and not even coming close to minimum wage, I gave up. Today’s roles are different and are a crucial part of LLM development. Alex Manthey, head of data at Contextual AI, is one of the people hiring writers to improve their models. She told the Observer that the practice is “mission critical”, as you “need humans in the loop to make sure [the model’s output] is palatable to the end user”. The human touch pays off. There’s a “reason why every company is spending so much time and unbelievable amounts of money making this happen,” she says. According to both Chollet and Manthey, hiring in the sector has recently shifted away from controversial, low-paid work in developing countries towards more specialised, high-paid roles. As models get better at writing, the quality of training data they need rises. Higher salaries follow. Several remote annotation roles will pay writers upwards of £30 an hour. Third-party annotation vendors such as Scale AI (valued at $14bn) are also capitalising on this scarcity of high-quality training data. Snippets from current UK job ads for AI annotation work give a clue as to the range of tasks involved: “create responses that will form the ‘voice’ of future AI”; “provide feedback to teach AI models to become more helpful, accurate, and safe”; “write clear, concise, factually and grammatically correct responses”; “coach an AI model by assessing the quality of AI-generated writing, reviewing the work of fellow writing evaluators, and crafting original responses to prompts”. If chatbots can pretend to write like humans, we can also pretend to write like chatbots. But will this process continue? Will humans just forever write the words that AI models need to be able to do human jobs? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of the whole enterprise? While one of the core methods underpinning the models is known as RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback), it’s unclear how many outside the field understand that the “secret sauce” behind these celebrated models relies on plain old human work. If technology companies can throw huge amounts of money at hiring writers to create better training data, it does slightly call into question just how “artificial” current AIs really are. The big technology companies have not been “that explicit at all” about this process, says Chollet, who expects investment in AI (and therefore annotation budgets) to “correct” in the near future. Manthey suggests that investors will probably question the “huge line item” taken up by “hefty data budgets”, which cover licensing and human annotation alike. If the current models can’t risk running out of new words to train on, then perhaps we as writers will never run out of work. But technology fidgets. Better models, with different techniques and more efficient training needs, might appear. The next generation of annotators will need to be better than the AI at whatever skill it needs to master next: theoretical physics, maybe? Medical diagnosis? Cracking language is at best an intermediary goal. Our words will be but temporary fuel."

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. The father of the 14-year-old suspect in the Georgia school shooting has been arrested in connection with the incident that killed four people, the Georgia bureau of investigation has said. Colin Gray, 54, has been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children, according to the bureau. His son, Colt, is suspected of killing two students and two teachers with an assault-style rifle at Apalachee high school on Wednesday. “His charges are directly connected with the actions of his son and allowing him to possess a weapon,” Chris Hosey, the director of the Georgia bureau of investigations, said. The 14-year-old had been charged as an adult in the deaths of two students, Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and two staff, Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, Hosey said. At least nine others – seven students and two teachers – were hospitalized with injuries. Trump tells Jewish donors they would be ‘abandoned’ if Harris elected Donald Trump has told Jewish donors they would be “abandoned” if Kamala Harris won November’s presidential election as he sought to present her potential presidency in dire terms for Israel. Without offering evidence for the claim, the Republican candidate told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Thursday: “You’re going to be abandoned if she becomes president. And I think you need to explain that to your people … You’re not going to have an Israel if she becomes president.” Trump appeared remotely, dialing in to speak to an audience of more than 1,000 donors. Trump also vowed to ban refugee resettlement from what he described as “terror-infested” areas such as Gaza, and arrest “pro-Hamas thugs” who committed vandalism, seemingly referring to pro-Palestinian student protesters. Was Palestinian resettlement lower under Trump? Similar numbers of refugees from the territories have been admitted under the Trump and Joe Biden administrations – 114 in three years under Trump, and 124 in the same length of time under Biden. FBI raids homes of police commissioner and top aides to New York mayor – report Federal agents have reportedly raided the homes of senior officials in the New York City mayor, Eric Adams’s, administration. Early on Wednesday, agents searched the homes of Sheena Wright, the first deputy mayor; Philip Banks III, the deputy mayor for public safety; and Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking police official, a local outlet, the City, reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Devices were also reportedly taken from the home of Edward Caban, the police commissioner, but it was unclear whether this operation was linked to those involving the Adams administration officials. Authorities have not accused Adams or his officials of any crimes and the reason for the reported raids remains unclear. The Guardian has contacted the FBI and Adams’ office for comment. What has the mayor said about this? “The goal is to follow the law and that is what this administration always stood for and what we’re going to continue to stand for,” Adams said on Thursday afternoon.

                    "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap… The UK’s housing sector has grown at the fastest rate since 2022, when the mini-budget knocked the industry almost two years ago, as the construction sector ‘turned a corner’ after a difficult start to the year. But UK car sales fell in August, for the first time in just over two years, with the industry warning that the target for electric car sales this year will be missed. In the US, a flurry of jobs data has painted a mixed picture, ahead of tomorrow’s official employment report, the Non-Farm Payroll. Company payrolls rose by less than expected in August; they increased by 99,000, the smallest gain since 2021. Job cuts also rose in August, with US employers announcing the greatest number of layoffs in five months. But in better news, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment support fell last week, remaining at historically low levels. Back in the UK, Royal Mail could be allowed to scrap second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays, as part of a shake-up of the company’s universal service obligation. In the retail world, Currys has reported a jump in sales of electrical goods, thanks to the Euro 2024 mens football tournament and interest in AI. But Primark has suffered a drop in UK sales this summer, as bad weather kept people off the high street and dampened demand for summer clothing. The competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the Oasis ticket sales fiasco. Petrol and diesel pump prices in the UK have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three years. John Lewis is reviving its “never knowingly undersold” price promise. And in Germany, three executives from the defunct German payments firm have been ordered to pay €140m in damages today over loans to an Asian business partner that were never repaid. Economic activity in the US services sector expanded for the second consecutive month in August, a new survey from the Institute of Supply Management shows. The ISM’s Services PMI for August has risen to 51.5%, up from 51.4% in July. This is the sixth month this year that the Services PMI has come in over 50 points, showing an expansion. Services companies reported that business activity, new orders and employment all rose last month. Steve Miller, chair of the Institute for Supply Management services business survey committee, says: Slow-to-moderate growth was cited across many industries, while ongoing high costs and interest-rate pressures were often mentioned as negatively impacting business performance and driving softness in sales and traffic. Although the Inventories Index increased by 3.1 percentage points into expansion territory in August, many respondents indicated their companies are still actively managing down their inventories.” Back in the UK, there’s been a small shareholder rebellion at electricals retailer Currys, over executive pay. Almost 12% of votes at its annual general meeting were cast against approving the Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as investors digest today’s flurry of US employment data. The S&amp;P 500 share index has risen by 2 points, or 0.05%, to 5,522 points at the open. The narrower Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 0.25%, following the slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs in August. Tech stocks, which do well in a low interest-rate environment, are rallying, pushing up the Nasdaq Composite index by 0.5%. Britain’s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into Ticketmaster over the sale of tickets for Oasis concerts next year. The Competition and Markets Authority will look into the ‘dynamic pricing’ which meant Oasis fans spent hours queuing, and were then presented with much higher ticket prices than advertised. The CMA will look into whether the sale of Oasis tickets by Ticketmaster may have breached consumer protection law. It will examine whether: Ticketmaster has engaged in unfair commercial practices which are prohibited under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 People were given clear and timely information to explain that the tickets could be subject to so-called ‘dynamic pricing’ with prices changing depending on demand, and how this would operate, including the price they would pay for any tickets purchased People were put under pressure to buy tickets within a short period of time – at a higher price than they understood they would have to pay, potentially impacting their purchasing decisions. We are being spoiled today, with three surveys of the US jobs market. And the third – the weekly tally of unemployment claims – is better than expected. There were 227,000 new ‘initial claims’ for jobless support last week, a drop of 5,000 on the previous seven days, and below the 230,000 which economists expected. That may calm some concerns over the US economy. Newsflash: In a further sign that the US jobs market is cooling, American firms added much fewer new jobs than expected last month. The monthly survey of private sector hiring from payrolls operator ADP has found that private employers added 99,000 jobs in August. That’s the smallest monthly rise since 2021, CNBC reports. Economists had expected a rise of aroud 145,000. This is the fifth month running that ADP has reported a slowdown in job creation among private employers. And added to the rise in layoffs reported by Challenger earlier today, it paints a worrying picture about the US jobs market. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, says: The job market’s downward drift brought us to slower-than-normal hiring after two years of outsized growth. The next indicator to watch is wage growth, which is stabilizing after a dramatic post-pandemic slowdown. Large companies, with at least 500 staff, added 42,000 workers last month, reports ADP. Medium-sized, with between 50 and 499 staff, added a total of 68,000. Firms with between 1 and 19 employees added 3,000 staff, but those with 2o to 49 employees laid off 12,000. John Lewis is reviving its “never knowingly undersold” price promise, which it ditched just two and a half years ago, as part of a marketing blitz as it heads into the all-important Christmas selling season. The retailer said it would use AI tools to match prices both in-store and online for 25 competitors including Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, Currys, House of Fraser and, on technology only – Amazon – from Monday. Under the new scheme, customers will be able to get their money back if they can show they have found an item cheaper at one of the 25 brands within seven days. Peter Ruis, head of the department store group, said John Lewis was making a multimillion-pound investment in the relaunch of the slogan – which it used for nearly a century before it was dropped in February 2022 – including in the technology, price changes and marketing. More here. In another sign that the US jobs market is softening, year-to-date hiring has weakened too. According to Challenger tracking, announced hiring plans have fallen to the lowest year-to-date total since Challenger began tracking company hiring plans in 2005. The Challenger job layoffs report also shows that 37,403 job cuts were attributed to “Cost-Cutting” last month, while 16,439 were due to “Market/Economic Conditions.” For the first time since April, employers specified Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a reason for job cuts. Last month, 5,943 cuts were due to AI, all of which occurred in the Technology space. So far this year, 7,126 cuts are due to AI. Here’s some snap reaction to the rise in US layoffs announced in August: US tech companies announced 39,563 job cuts in August, today’s Challenger report shows, out of 75,891 in total. Andrew Challenger says the rollout of artificial intelligence systems is one factor driving layoffs: The Tech sector is moving from a growth and innovation focus into one of profitability and efficiency. AI and automation adoption is also driving job cuts at Tech companies across roles and functions. This talent, however, is still in high demand. Many of these professionals will land elsewhere, in and outside of the Tech industry. That said, we’re entering a period of slower hiring, so it may take longer than it has at any point in the last decade,” Newsflash: There was a surge in layoffs at US companies in August, a new survey shows. Firms announced 75,891 layoffs last month, roughly triple the number in July, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas has reported. More than half the layoffs were led by the technology sector, where companies have been cutting their workforce as the pandemic boom in demand for IT services faded. Challenger vice president Andrew Challenger says: “August’s surge in job cuts reflects growing economic uncertainty and shifting market dynamics. Companies are facing a variety of pressures, from rising operational costs to concerns about a potential economic slowdown, leading them to make tough decisions about workforce management.” This jump in layoffs may add to concerns that the US labor market is cooling. Greenpeace UK have blocked access to Unilever’s headquarters in central London on Thursday morning claiming the consumer goods company is “trashing the planet and harming communities” through single-use plastics. Members of the environmental campaign group have locked themselves onto barricades made from giant Dove products, one of Unilever’s biggest brands, with each product’s logo changed to a dead Dove. Greenpeace is calling on Unilever to remove single-use plastic from its operations and phase it out fully within a decade, starting with plastic sachets, which they say are “near impossible to collect and recycle”. Will McCallum, co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “Unilever’s plastic pollution is trashing the planet and harming communities. “They hide behind the clean, respectable face of brands like Dove but we’re here today peeling back this facade to show the ugly truth behind it.” He added: “They must stop selling plastic sachets now, commit to phasing out single-use plastic within a decade and advocate for this same level of ambition at the final round of UN Global Plastics Treaty negotiations in November.” Wirecard ex-CEO Markus Braun and two other executives at the defunct German payments firm have been ordered to pay €140m in damages today, Reuters reports, over loans to an Asian business partner that were never repaid. A Munich court judge upheld claims by insolvency administrator Michael Jaffe that Braun and others had violated their duties in deciding to provide the loans to a company in Singapore. The verdict, which is not final, is the latest chapter in one of Germany’s most egregious corporate scandals and is separate to the main trial against Braun and other executives. over Wirecard’s demise. The company collapsed in June 2020 with a €1.9bn hole in its balance sheet, turning the spotlight on politicians who backed it and regulators accused of moving. too slowly to investigate allegations against it. Braun, deputy finance chief Stephan von Erffa and Wirecard’s Asia representative Oliver Bellenhaus are currently on trial in Munich accused of fraud and falsifying financial statements. Braun denies all wrongdoing. In August, German prosecutors charged another two former Wirecard executives with several counts of embezzlement. Jaffe and investors are trying to sue Wirecard managers and auditors for damages in various civil lawsuits. Unions at Volkswagen could propose a four-day week, to avoid factory closures and job cuts at the German carmaker. Christiane Benner, chair of the IG Metall union, has said it is “conceivable” that it could propose a four-day week, saying: “We will leave no idea unexplored.” But Benner cautioned that it is impossible to lay out detailed proposals without more information on what solutions VW is proposing, saying: “We need forward-thinking ideas on where potential can be found. VW has survived difficult situations before.” Yesterday VW told staff that it is considering shutting two German factories, in what would be the carmaker’s first closures ever in its home country. Newsflash: Ireland’s economy is on the brink of recession, by some measures, after activity shrank in the second quarter of this year. New estimates from Ireland’s Central Statistics Office show that Ireland’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 1.0% in the April-June quarter. That’s down from an initial estimate of 1.2% growth in the quarter. GDP isn’t a great measure of Ireland’s economy, though, as it can be distorted by multinational firms based in the Republic. Modified Domestic Demand (MDD), a broad measure of underlying domestic activity that covers personal, government, and investment spending, also shows a decline. It decreased by 0.5% in Q2 2024. However, Gross national product (GNP) – which measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country in one year, including profits made in foreign countries – rose by 3.3% in the quarter. This puts Ireland on the edge of a technical recession – defined as two quarterly contractions in a row. In Q1, GDP rose by 0.9% while MDD inceased by 1.4%. The CSO reports that Ireland’s domestic sectors contracted by 1.8% in the April-June quarter with the multinational-dominated sectors declining marginally by 0.1%. Assistant Director General with responsibility for Economic Statistics, Chris Sibley, says: “In today’s results, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by 1.0% in April, May, and June (Q2) 2024. The globalised Industry sector fell by 0.7% in Q2 2024 compared with Q1 2024 while the Information &amp; Communication sector posted a decrease of 0.9% over the same period. Overall, the combined multinational-dominated elements of the Industry and Information &amp; Communication sectors declined by 0.1% in the quarter. These sectors accounted for 43.9% of total value added in the economy, compared with a 56.1% share for all other sectors. Labour’s election success in early July could have boosted activity in the commercial building sector last month. Today’s PMI report says: Commercial activity was the best-performing segment, despite the pace of growth slipping to its lowest since March. A number of firms noted a boost from rising sales enquiries and the release of new orders following the general election. S&amp;P Global adds that respondents to its PMI survey said improving economic conditions and greater domestic political stability had lifted customer demand, leading to an increase in orders last month. The Labour government’s housebuilding push should help the recovery in housebuilding to strengthen, predicts the EY ITEM Club. EY ITEM Club say that housebuilders should feel more confident about starting projects, as housing transactions and prices have started to recover and the government has made housebuilding a key priority. Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, says: House prices and transactions have passed the bottom and are starting to recover, which will bolster firms’ confidence in building. The new government’s focus on housebuilding as a key pillar of its growth plan is also likely to be supporting confidence, although capacity constraints, particularly in terms of the availability of staff with the appropriate skills, will need to be overcome.” UK housebuilding accelerated last month thanks to the ongoing economic recovery, and lower borrowing costs, explains Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK. Pugh adds: Mortgage approvals jumped in July and annual house price growth picked up as well, clear signs of a revival in the housing market. Pugh points out that the future activity index and new orders measures within the PMI are still high indicating optimism in the industry, adding: “What’s more, there was further good news for policy makers as the input prices balance dropped, suggesting that price pressures are easing in the construction sector as well as the services and manufacturing sectors. That bodes well for interest rate cuts later this year. Although UK housebuilding activity picked up last month, hiring across the construction sector did not. Staffing levels were broadly unchanged, according to the purchasing managers surveyed for today’s construction PMI report. That ends a three-month period of expansion. Firms also cut back on sub-contractor usage, for the first time since January. Some firms noted that elevated wage pressures had led to delays with staff hiring, while others commented on a lack of candidates to fill vacancies. S&amp;P Global explains. Newsflash: Growth in Britain’s housebuilding sector has hit its highest rate since the mini-budget almost two years ago. Data provider S&amp;P Global has reported that UK residential construction work “gained momentum” in August, with growth accelerating to its fastest since September 2022. This increase in housebuilding was due to “improving market conditions” and lower borrowing costs, S&amp;P Global says. However, civil engineering growth slowed last month, which pulled the overall construction PMI down to 53.6 in August, down from July’s 26-month high of 55.3. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: “The UK construction sector appears to have turned a corner after a difficult start to 2024, with renewed vigour in the house building segment the most notable development in August. Residential work expanded at the fastest pace for almost two years as lower borrowing costs and a gradual recovery in market conditions helped to boost activity. Commercial building was the best-performing part of the construction sector as the improving UK economic backdrop resulted in stronger order books, but the postelection bounce in demand faded somewhat in August. Borrowing costs jumped after the September 2022 mini-budget, driving up mortgage rates and making it harder for buyers to get a home loan. Mortgage rates have been dropping this summer, as the City anticipates more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. The Labour government has pledged to “get Britain building again” by bringing back compulsory housebuilding targets, and to build 370,000 homes a year during the course of the current parliament. Good news for motorists who haven’t made the switch to electric vehicles – fossil fuel costs have hit a near three-year low. Motoring body the AA reports that the average price of petrol dropped to 139.5p a litre yesterday, the lowest since October 2021. Diesel yesterday fell to 144.2p a litre, on average, also the lowest since October 2021 – a few months before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy costs soaring. The AA says the 5p fuel duty cut made in the March 2022 budget helped push price down. Edmund King, AA president, warned the government against removing the cut in this October’s budget – something that is reportedly under consideration. King says: “Pure and simple, the only reason why pump prices are at a three-year low this week is because of the 5p fuel duty cut. Removing it threatens to send millions of low-income drivers back into the era of ‘perma-high’ road fuel prices. However, the freeze in fuel duty does cost the Treasury billions of pounds per year, as these posts show: So far this year, the market share held by battery electric cars (BEVs) has risen to 17.2%, up from 16.5% in 2023. The SMMT expect it to rise to 18.5% by the end of the year thanks to increasing model choice – with some 364,000 BEVs registrations forecast for the year. But, that means the UK would miss the goal that 22% of each carmaker’s sales must be pure battery cars in 2024, laid out in the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate (as the industry warned last month). The SMMT says “urgent action is needed”, including binding targets on public chargepoint provision and the reintroduction of incentives to encourage private buyers to go electric. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: August’s EV growth is welcome, but it’s always a very low volume month and so subject to distortions ahead of September’s number plate change. The introduction of the new 74 plate, together with a raft of compelling offers and discounts from manufacturers, plus growing model choice, will help increase purchase consideration and be a true barometer for market demand. Encouraging a mass market shift to EVs remains a challenge, however, and urgent action must be taken to help buyers overcome affordability issues and concerns about chargepoint provision. Newsflash: UK car sales fell in August, ending a 24-month run of growth. Industry body SMMT reports that new car registrations dipped by 1.3% last month, to 84,575 units. August is traditionally a snoozy month for car dealers, as many buyers preferring to wait for September’s new number plate (or are busy on holiday instead!). This time, fleet purchases (companies buying cars for their business) fell by 1.2% while sales to private buyers were 0.2% higher. Business registrations sank by nearly a third to just 1,136 units. There are some interesting trends among the types of cars being bought. Registrations of electric cars (Battery electric vehicles or BEVs) jumped by 10.8%. This lifted the BEV market share to 22.6%, the highest for a month since December 2022. The SMMT says this is due to “heavy discounting by manufacturers over the summer and a raft of new models attracting buyers.” Petrol sales fell 10.1%, while diesel dropped by 7.3% – but together made up 56.8% of all new registrations in August. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) registrations declined by 12.3%, but hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) uptake increased by 36.1%. Yesterday, Volvo Cars abandoned its target of sell only electric cars by 2030, citing “changing market conditions and customer demands.” We’ve covered plenty of bad economic news from Germany recently, with its economy shrinking in April-June and carmaker Volkswagen considering factory closures. So it’s a relief to have some good news from Europe’s largest economy. German factory orders rose by 2.9% month-on-month in July, statistics body Destatis reported this morning, smashing forecasts of a 1.5% fall. This is “a rare piece of good news for the country’s important manufacturing sector,” say analysts at Saxo. However…. the figures are flattered by some large orders, such as aircraft, ships, trains, and military vehicles. Strip those out, and industrial orders were 0.4% lower than in June. We also have results from online clothing retailer ASOS this morning, but they don’t report problems from the bad weather. ASOS told the City that its adjusted profits for the current financial year are expected to hit the top of analyst estimates…. but its sales will be “slightly below guidance”. ASOS has also struck a deal to sell a majority of its stake in Topshop and Topman brands – which it acquired in 2021 – to a new joint venture formed with Danish family office HEARTLAND, which would own 75% of the new entity. ASOS expects to get about £118m from the sale, and will hold the remaining 25% of the joint venture. After 15 years, luxury goods brand Burberry’s run in the FTSE 100 index is soon to end. Burberry is being relegated down to the FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized companies, later this month. FTSE Russell, the global index provider, announced last night that insurer Hiscox will take Burberry’s place in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in the next quarterly reshuffle. Burberry’s relegation isn’t a surprise; its market capitalisation has fallen to £2.23bn, meaning it was no longer valuable enough to hold a place in the FTSE 100. Elsewhere, UK computer firm Raspberry Pi is joining the FTSE 250 following its stock market float this summer. Police in China have detained five current and former employees of British drugmaker AstraZeneca for questioning about potential illegal activities, Bloomberg are reporting. Bloomberg explains: The individuals being held are all Chinese citizens who marketed cancer drugs in AstraZeneca’s oncology division, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The investigation is being led by police in the southern metropolis of Shenzhen, and the detentions took place earlier in the summer, the people said. One probe is related to the company’s collection of patient data, and whether that infringed China’s data-privacy laws, according to the people. Authorities are also looking into some of the individuals’ involvement in importing a liver cancer drug that hasn’t been approved for distribution in mainland China, one of the people said. China made up 13% of AstraZeneca’s global sales last year, bringing in revenues of nearly $6bn of a total $44bn, making it the biggest overseas pharmaceuticals company by sales. The company had considered spinning off its business in China and listing it in Hong Kong or Shanghai to shield it from geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. Shares in Associated British Foods have fallen 3.8% at the start of trading in London, as traders react to the drop in sales at its UK Primark stores this summer. They’re the top faller on the FTSE 100 index. While the cold and wet British summer dampened demand at Primark, electricals retailer Currys was growing its sales over the summer. Currys grew its like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland by 5% in the 17 weeks to 24 August. This was partly due to England’s performance in EURO 2024, it says, as some families bought new TVs to enjoy the Three Lions’ occasionally choppy route to the final. Currys is also seeing intest in AI computing products, it says. Alex Baldock, Currys chief executive, explains: “Trading is going well, strengthening our confidence in growing profit and free cash flow again this year. New AI-enabled computers are bringing excitement and innovation to customers, who are coming to our stores to learn more about the technology, helping us take almost 50% share of the total laptop market. ABF had been expected to release its trading update this week, but has brought it forward due to the disappointing sales at Primark and the lower than expected sugar profits. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: It’s a bit of shock to hear that mighty Primark has been over 3% down LFL in the last 3 months… [that’s the fall in UK like-for-like sales]. Cutting deliveries of second-class letters to just two or three days a week would save Royal Mail hundreds of millions of pound a year. As my colleague Alex Lawson explained here in April, a postal worker could deliver on a single route on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and on another route on Tuesday and Thursday. First class letters would then be shipped faster on Royal Mail vans also used for parcels. Citizens Advice say that changes to the universal service obligation are needed – but should benefit customers, not just save Royal Mail money. Tom MacInnes, Interim Director of Policy at Citizens Advice, says: “With Royal Mail failing to meet its targets for nearly half a decade, the current Universal Service Obligation (USO) clearly doesn’t protect consumers as it should. “Reforms to the USO need to address this. They can’t just be a disguise for cuts that prioritise saving Royal Mail money over providing a good standard of service. “We agree that improving reliability and affordability is essential. But cutting deliveries won’t automatically lead to the more reliable service people need. “Ofcom has acknowledged some of Royal Mail’s failings but we need to see that recognised with action. The regulator needs to make sure we have a USO that serves its basic purpose of protecting consumers - not Royal Mail’s bottom line.” Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services, says the universal service obligation needs to change. Responding to the news that Ofcom is considering its proposal to downgrade second class deliveries, Martin Seidenberg, Group CEO of IDS, says: “To save the Universal Service, we have to change the Universal Service. “Letter volumes have fallen from their peak of 20 billion to just 6.7 billion a year today meaning the average household now receives just four letters per week. Yet whilst most countries have adapted their Universal Service requirements to reflect the new reality, in the UK the minimum requirements have not changed. “Our proposal for the future of the Universal Service has been developed after speaking to thousands of people across the country and is designed to protect what matters most for customers. It can be achieved through regulatory change with no need for new legislation. “The Universal Service faces a very real and urgent financial sustainability challenge. Change cannot come soon enough. We look forward to continuing to engage with all our stakeholders to secure a financially sustainable Universal Service for many years to come.” Another British institution, Primark, has been hit by the grizzly weather this summer. Primark’s owner, Associated British Foods, warned shareholders this morning that like-for-like sales at the clothing chain have fallen in the last six months. Like‐for‐like sales are expected to decrease by around 0.5% in the six months to 14 September, driven by a 0.9% decline in the last three months. In the UK, alone, like‐for‐like sales are expected to decrease by around 2.0% in the six months to 14 September, including a 3.1% drop in the last quarter – with customer visits “impacted by challenging weather, particularly in April and June.” ABF says: This primarily reflects unfavourable weather in the UK and Ireland in H2, which resulted in lower footfall and particularly impacted sales of our seasonal lines in womenswear and footwear. But thanks to new store openings, Primark’s overall revenue growth is expected to be around 4% for the last six months. Last summer was the coolest since 2015, according to provisional Met Office statistics. This made it more of a ‘drat summer’ than a ‘brat summmer’ for retailers hoping to shift summery garments. Or, as CEO George Weston puts it this morning, “the British weather was not in Primark’s favour this summer.” ABF has also flagged that profits at its sugar business will be below expectations, due to “a sharp fall in European sugar prices” this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s Royal Mail “must improve” its delivery performance, says communications regulator Ofcom this morning, as it proposes changes to its second-class letter service. The proposals are meant to secure the future of the universal postal service, it says. Ofcom warns that Royal Mail’s delivery performance has simply “not been good enough” in recent years. In the last five years, the regulator has found it in breach of its quality of service obligations twice and fined it both times. The regulator says: We have been pressing the company on what it is doing to turn things around, and we are currently investigating its latest failure to hit its annual delivery targets. Regardless of how the universal service evolves, Royal Mail’s delivery performance must improve. Ofcom has been examining potential changes to the universal obligation – that compels the postal operator to deliver letters six days a week (Monday to Saturday) and parcels five days a week (Monday to Friday) to every address in the UK. And today, it is proposing that Royal Mail should be allowed to downgrade its second class service, and no longer deliver letters with a 2nd class stamp on Saturdays. The regulator argues that this would give Royal Mail flexibility to improve its service, and is going to consult on the plan. Ofcom says today: The evidence we have gathered so far also suggests people want a next-day service available six days a week for when they need to send the occasional urgent letter or card. However, people acknowledge that most letters are not urgent. If Second Class letters continued to be delivered within three working days but not on Saturdays - and First Class remained unchanged at six days a week - it would enable Royal Mail to improve reliability, make substantial efficiency savings, and redeploy its existing resources to growth areas such as parcels. This proposal is likely to please Royal Mail – back in April, it asked Ofcom to let it reduce deliveries of second-class letters to just two or three days a week Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s group director for networks and communications, says Royal Mail must do better: Postal users’ needs are at the heart of our review. If we decide to propose changes to the universal service next year, we want to make sure we achieve the best outcome for consumers. So we’re now looking at whether we can get the universal service back on an even keel in a way that meets people’s needs. But this won’t be a free pass for Royal Mail – under any scenario, it must invest in its network, become more efficient and improve its service levels.

                    "bodyText": "John Lewis is reviving its “never knowingly undersold” price promise, which it ditched just two and a half years ago, as part of a marketing blitz as it heads into the all-important Christmas selling season. The retailer said it would use artificial intelligence tools to match prices both in-store and online for 25 competitors including Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, Currys, House of Fraser and, on technology only – Amazon – from Monday. Under the new scheme, if customers can show within seven days they have found an item at a cheaper price at one of the 25 brands, then they will be refunded the difference. Prices will be adjusted every day based on the AI-led assessment of the market. Peter Ruis, the head of the department store group, said John Lewis was making a multimillion-pound investment in the relaunch of the slogan – which it used for nearly a century before it was dropped in February 2022 – including in the technology used, price changes and marketing. He said 30,000 prices would be adjusted in the first week, backed by a big TV campaign featuring a voiceover by the actor Samantha Morton and a reworking of Paul Simon’s I Know What I Know by the singer Laura Mvula. The promotion is one of three similarly themed ads planned in the run-up to Christmas which John Lewis said would be the brand’s “biggest ever investment in marketing in the second half [of the year]”. Ruis said he had begun working on bringing back the never knowingly undersold policy in February, shortly after rejoining the staff-owned group, as he said the removal of the price promise had led shoppers to lose faith they were getting the best value with John Lewis. “When we removed the price promise, [shoppers] automatically assumed all prices went up,” he said. “This is not a drive to more lower-priced product but a drive to what John Lewis has always been – the democracy of really good essential prices right up to the premium level.” He said the brand relaunch would also emphasise John Lewis’s customer service, including its lengthy guarantees on technology or large furniture, while new systems would give online shoppers access to product within physical stores. The group is also testing the idea of fashion brands funding workers within department stores, as some cosmetics and tech companies already do. Ruis said these would be new employees, and existing staff – known as partners because they jointly own the business – would not be transferred. However, the move is likely to be seen as a shift away from the partnership model, which offers pricey perks including an annual profit-linked bonus. Ruis’s predecessor, Pippa Wicks, ditched the price pledge as the retailer’s profits dived amid pressure to match rivals’ prices, claiming the promise had lost relevance because it did not apply to online-only retailers. He said new technology and a more focused approach would give the slogan a modern twist. “It has always been amazing. It just has to be appropriate for the arena we are in now. We had to pause it to change it.” He said reviving the pledge would not hit profits but would drive sales. “We have modelled this every which way and do not see a [profit] margin problem with this,” he said. “We are reimagining never knowingly undersold for how customers shop today – offering great quality, service and prices in store and online. “One hundred years ago John Spedan Lewis created Britain’s most innovative and famous brand mantra. It defines why John Lewis is so special.” The new scheme has been tested on 7,000 customers in recent weeks and 63% said they were more likely to buy from the department store as a result."

Here are the main stories: Bill Shorten announces his retirement, leading to tributes from Anthony Albanese and former PMs. He will become the University of Canberra vice-chancellor; The Reserve Bank governor, Michelle Bullock, warns some owner-occupiers may be forced to sell their home if they’re in “cashflow shortfall”; The Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe weather warnings for a large part of south-eastern Australia, saying a front that is expected to hit Victoria and NSW later tonight could bring dangerous winds; Kat McNamara has unseated the former NT chief minister Natasha Fyles in the electorate of Nightcliff, becoming the first Greens MP elected in territory history; The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, says former union boss John Setka’s appearances at two taxpayer-funded projects have been referred to police; and The Australian Electoral Commission has officially abolished the Higgins electorate in Victoria and created the Bullwinkel electorate in Western Australia. Thanks for reading. We will see you back here again tomorrow. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, also pays tribute to Shorten. Julia Gillard honours Shorten’s achievements in parliament And another former PM weighs in on Bill Shorten’s departure ACTU thank Shorten for ‘unwavering commitment to working people’ In more ACTU news, they have also put put a statement in honour of the outgoing Bill Shorten. Law Institute of Victoria pays tribute to outgoing chief justice The Law Institute of Victoria has paid tribute to the outgoing chief justice, Anne Ferguson, describing her as an inspiring leader and role model. Matthew Hibbins, the institute’s president, said: The Hon Chief Justice Anne Ferguson has been an inspiring leader of the legal profession in Victoria and on behalf of the Board, staff and more than 20,000 members of the LIV, we thank her for her service and wish her well upon her retirement. The Chief Justice has been a role model for what a solicitor on the Bench can be, and there are many across the profession who have been inspired by her professional journey. The LIV wishes her well on her retirement. The Chief Justice has been a spearhead for change in the legal profession, including with respect to integrity, courtesy, and, importantly, the elimination of sexual harassment within the profession. We applaud her leadership of cultural change in the legal profession. Tradies union walks away from ACTU, saying it only represents white-collar workers The Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union has met today and decided to disaffiliate from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Allen Hicks, the New South Wales and ACT secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, said that given the ACTU had supported special laws to put the construction union into administration it is clear the “CEPU doesn’t align with the ACTU at this point in time”. The CEPU, which represents 100,000 workers, has proposed that blue-collar unions including metalworkers and construction union representatives should hold a summit within three months to discuss forming an alternate union grouping. Together this grouping represents at least 250,000 workers. Hicks said that blue-collar construction unions needed “a peak body to represent all unions, not just the select few”. Troy Gray, the ETU Victorian secretary, said the vote was “overwhelming” although not unanimous. He accused the ACTU of representing “white collar unions”. Gray said blue-collar unions “didn’t want to take our bat and ball and go home” and had decided it was more responsible to propose an alternative after disaffiliation, citing the US and UK as examples of other jurisdictions with different peak bodies. The former prime minister Tony Abbott wishes Bill Shorten well. Ananda-Rajah bemoans reduced diversity as seat abolished Michelle Ananda-Rajah has released a statement about the Australian Electoral Commission confirming the decision to abolish her seat of Higgins at the next election. She has paid tribute to the history of the seat in Melbourne’s inner east, and bemoaned the fact that abolishing it could reduce diversity in the parliament. It may not, however, be the end of her time in parliament, given that two Labor MPs, Bill Shorten and Brendan O’Connor, have announced they will be vacating their Melbourne seats (albeit in different parts of the city to Higgins). Ananda-Rajah said: As the first Labor Member for Higgins in its 75 year history, I am honoured to have served this lionhearted community. As a first generation migrant and public health professional with no political background, I am proud of my record of service and will continue to serve my country and the people of Higgins in whatever way I can. As is too often the case, this leaves the Commonwealth Parliament more male and less culturally diverse at a time when underrepresented people need to be seen and heard. My hope is that this diversity is not reduced in the 48th Parliament. I commit to doing everything in my power to make that happen. Ananda-Rajah also paid tribute to the two former prime ministers, Harold Holt and John Gorton, who were members for Higgins, and to Australia’s longest serving treasurer, Peter Costello, another former member. Independent candidate says ‘killing civilians is never OK’ after social media furore Dr Ziad Basyouny, the independent taking on Tony Burke in his western Sydney seat of Watson, has responded to a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald that alleged he shared a Facebook post celebrating the October 7 attacks, saying he supports “Palestinian resistance to oppression”. It comes after the piece alleged he shared a post on Facebook in the aftermath of the attacks that contained a machine gun-wielding paraglider, according to screenshots given to the paper. In response, Basyouny told the Guardian that “killing civilians is never OK”. I support the inherent right of Palestinians to take back and defend their land, but I do not support the attacks on civilians. As a doctor, a Muslim and a human, I obviously abhor attacks on civilians. The occupation of Palestine for more than 75 years and the violence the Palestinians have been subjected to, should be opposed by all. Palestinian resistance pre-dates Hamas, their struggle has been ongoing for decades, and I support the freedom of the Palestinians. But Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive at the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said the sharing of the post was not about “Israeli policy” and called on Dr Basyouny to apologise. “He should either apologise or be open about his support for terrorist atrocities targeting civilians. But claiming now his posts weren’t supportive of Hamas when the attacks he posted about were carried out by Hamas is taking the public for fools.” This post was corrected on 5 September 2024. An earlier version stated Sky News had reported on the post in question. Sky News had reported on a separate post. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe weather warnings for a large part of south-eastern Australia, saying a front that is expected to hit Victoria and NSW later tonight could bring dangerous winds. While it is expected that there will be a lull in gusts this afternoon, the wind is forecast to pick up overnight and early tomorrow morning, buffeting areas including western, central and eastern ranges of Victoria, and the southern part of the Great Dividing Range, including the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. The Bureau also warned of damaging winds covering the Surf Coast in Victoria, Wilsons Promontory and Gippsland, as well as much of south-eastern NSW, including parts of the Illawarra. The dangerous winds are expected to last for the next 24 hours. King Island Dairy to close, 58 jobs at risk Saputo has said in a statement that it has made “the difficult decision” to close Tasmania’s King Island Dairy, and will be closing the facility and retiring the brand by mid-2025. In a statement, Saputo Dairy Australia (SDA) said it had done a 10-month review of the Bass Strait business, and had also been unable to find a buyer. About 58 impacted employees had been told of the decision, and SDA said it would identify “redeployment opportunities, and where alternative roles are not available, employees will be provided with their full entitlements and outplacement support”. Leanne Cutts, the president and chief operating officer (international and Europe) of Saputo Inc, said the decision had not been taken lightly. Cutts said: As King Island Dairy’s historic roots are deeply embedded in the region, it was hoped the strategic review would identify a potential buyer for the facility. It is a unique brand, with a plant that is nearly 100 years old and designed to produce hand-made specialty cheeses. Don’t even get him started on New South Wales … That’s me signing off for the day, Nino Bucci will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage into this evening. Take care! Australia may delay release of 2035 climate target until after US election The Australian government may delay the announcement of a 2035 climate target until after the February deadline and beyond the next federal election, in part due to uncertainty about the ramifications of the US presidential election. Globally, governments are watching the US election before finalising their 2035 commitments. Observers believe Kamala Harris will quickly announce a target if successful but Donald Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax”, has said he would again pull the US out of the Paris deal. Read the full story for all the details below: BoM flags potential further river rises in Tasmania tomorrow The Bureau of Meteorology says Tasmania is continuing to see flooding impacts from last week’s rainfall. Flood warnings have been downgraded to minor, but cold fronts could bring moderate falls to northern and western parts of the state, the Bureau said, which could lead to renewed river rises from tomorrow. Reactions flow after Bill Shorten’s resignation announcement Reactions have been coming in from across the political spectrum all afternoon, after Bill Shorten’s announcement he would retire from politics in February to take up the role of vice-chancellor at the University of Canberra. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, described him as one of “Labor’s greats” and said: He’s always been a champion for fairness – standing with workers in the Beaconsfield mine disaster, supporting Robodebt victims [and] implementing and fixing the NDIS. Thank you for your service to the labour movement [and] the Australian people. The assistant foreign minister, Tim Watts, said Shorten had “limitless energy for the good fight”, while assistant minister to the PM, Patrick Gorman, said Shorten would “be missed from both the caucus and the parliament”. The shadow minister for home affairs, James Paterson, said he suspects “history will be kind to [Shorten] in a similar way it has been to Kim Beazley”. Bill is a Labor patriot who wanted the best for our country, and was responsible and constructive on matters of national security to his great credit. The shadow minister for social services, Michael Sukkar, sent Shorten his best wishes: While he’s been a fierce opponent, he’s also been willing to work in a collegial way with the Coalition in the best interests of Australia. AWU recognises Shorten’s service to labour movement following resignation announcement The Australian Workers’ Union has released a statement congratulating Bill Shorten on 30 years of service to the Australian labour movement. Shorten began his career with the AWU’s Victorian branch in 1994, and four years later was elected Victorian state secretary. In 2001 he became national secretary, six years before being elected the MP for Maribyrnong in 2007. The AWU national secretary, Paul Farrow, said in a statement: Bill led the union defining moments, including the collapse of Ansett and the Beaconsfield mine disaster. His leadership during these crises showed his relentless drive to support workers and ensure their rights were defended. He was always there — whether standing with families who had lost loved ones or advocating for thousands of members who found themselves out of work overnight. More strong winds expected tonight for south-eastern Australia The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, with more windy conditions set for south-east Australia as another front approaches tonight: The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, appears to have opened a TikTok account, under the handle peter.duttonmp. He currently has two followers on the verified account, both private accounts. This comes after Dutton has spent months calling on the government to ban the app. In March, he called for a US-style ban for Australian users, telling Sky News at the time: If data is being scraped by the terabytes off these accounts and young people are being exposed to extortion at some point, or just their personal data being collected, it’s not a safe platform. The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, also in March, labelled TikTok a “bad faith actor” and a “serious threat” to Australia’s national security, urging a US-style crackdown: Just circling back to the speech by Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, earlier: Bullock said that for owner-occupiers with variable loans, the RBA estimates 5% are in the “particularly challenging situation” where the combined total of their essential spending and mortgage payments is more than their income. She described this as a “cashflow shortfall”, and said: Although this group is fairly small overall, those in it have had to make quite painful adjustments to avoid falling behind on their mortgage repayments. This includes things like cutting back on their spending to the more essential items, trading down to lower quality goods and services, dipping into their savings or working extra hours. Some may ultimately make the difficult decision to sell their homes. A really important point to note here, is that lower income borrowers are over-represented in the group of people who are really struggling. Sophie Scamps throws support behind Pittwater candidate Teal independent and federal MP Dr Sophie Scamps has thrown her support behind her former staffer’s campaign for the New South Wales state seat of Pittwater at an upcoming by-election. Scamps released a statement a short time ago backing Jacqui Scruby’s bid for state parliament. She said: The people of Pittwater deserve honest and competent representation, and Jacqui will always put the community first. On the Northern Beaches people have the opportunity to elect leaders who will work constructively together and across the political spectrum. Scruby managed Scamps’ own successful campaign for the 2022 federal election and went on to work for her as an adviser. Scruby announced her candidacy this morning for the Pittwater by-election on 19 October, in what will be her second attempt at winning the seat on Sydney’s northern beaches. Teal independent says she is ‘underdog’ in contest for Pittwater Teal independent Jacqui Scruby says she is the “underdog” in the contest for the New South Wales seat of Pittwater, but believes she can run a strong campaign for a community that “deserves better”. Scruby today announced her candidacy for the upcoming by-election in the electorate on Sydney’s northern beaches, following the resignation of former MP Rory Amon after he was charged with 10 child sexual assault offences. Speaking to Guardian Australia this afternoon, Scruby said the community was “incredibly shocked” and thinking about what could come next. It’s this idea of people deserving better, wanting a fresh start, and raising the bar of NSW politics. It’s not only the scandals, but it’s also sort of the ineffective mess that the Liberal party is in at the moment from an administrative point of view and no doubt, from a policy point of view as well. A former environmental lawyer who has worked for federal teal independents Sophie Scamps and Zali Steggall, Scruby ran against Amon at the 2023 state election. Amon won the seat by just 606 votes, with Scruby achieving a historic 22% swing against the Liberals. Earlier today, Scruby said: I have amazing volunteers and people from all walks of life from across Pittwater who are giving their support. We can run a really strong campaign, and I can get out there and listen and be supported, but at the same time I’m not taking anything for granted. Woman charged after injured baby found outside home A woman has been charged after a newborn baby was found seriously injured outside a Melbourne home, AAP reports. The boy was discovered outside a Dandenong North address in Melbourne’s south-east at about 2.40am on 30 August. The newborn was initially taken to hospital in a critical condition. Police have today said the baby remained in hospital with “serious but non-life-threatening injuries”. A 25-year-old woman was taken from the scene on Gladstone Rd to hospital under police guard. She remains in hospital and has since been charged with conduct endangering life and recklessly cause injury. She has been released on bail and will appear before Dandenong magistrates court on 5 December. Michele Bullock’s speech and Q&amp;A has now wrapped up. Michele Bullock said she “wouldn’t say that high interest rates are worse than the problem of high inflation”. The RBA governor said that inflation “hurts everyone, and it hurts the most vulnerable”, and that using interest rates to bring it down to target is “absolutely worth achieving”. We’ve tried to raise interest rates to get them restrictive enough to bring inflation back down to target without overdoing it, and we’ve been sometimes criticised for that. Some people have said you should have gone as far as the Fed have gone, we haven’t. We’ve tried to maintain a interest rate that is as high enough as it needs to be to bring inflation back down, and I do believe – and I know the board believes – that that is the best course of action. RBA governor rebuffs opposition’s suggestion of ‘war’ with Chalmers Michele Bullock was asked if she agreed with comments from the opposition today that she and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, are “at war”. She responded: He’s doing his job and I’m doing mine. I wouldn’t use those sorts of words. Q: Given the RBA has just one blunt instrument, as you put it, in interest rates, does the federal government need to be doing more to bring down inflation? Michele Bullock responded: The federal government and the treasurer said a number of times that he’s doing his bit to try and bring down inflation. My job is to focus on what I can do, which is only the interest rate. I think all the governments are conscious of it, because, quite frankly, all of their constituents are suffering from high inflation, so I think they are focused on it. Bullock has ‘no comment’ on Chalmers’ suggestion interest rate hikes are ‘smashing the economy’ Michele Bullock has now been asked about comments made by the treasurer at the weekend that the RBA’s higher interest rates is “smashing the economy.” She acknowledged “people are hurting from high interest rates”, but argued it is “actually high inflation that is really causing trouble for people”. It’s affecting everyone. So the role of interest rates in this is to try and temper demand. That’s what monetary policy does – and it’s working, clearly working – but we need to see the results in the inflation numbers. That’s [why] we need to see inflation coming down, because … if we don’t get inflation down, it’s bad for everyone, absolutely everyone. On Chalmers’ remarks, Bullock said that she had “no comment to make on the comments”. Why is RBA not adjusting down interest rate predictions if people are spending less? The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, has wrapped up her speech in Sydney and is now taking questions from reporters. A reporter asks, in simple terms, if people are spending less – according to yesterday’s national accounts – why is the RBA not adjusting down its predictions about what it’ll do with interest rates? Bullock said that inflation needed to subside before it can do that, stating: In simple terms, it’s the difference between growth rates and levels. It’s true that the growth rate of GDP has slowed. GDP itself was around about where we forecast it would be, but the components were a little different. Consumer consumption was a little softer, but part of monetary policy’s job has been to try and slow the growth of the economy, because the level of demand for goods and services in the economy is higher than the ability of the economy to supply those goods and services. So there’s still a gap there … Part of it is that demand was so strong coming out of the pandemic that its level is still above the ability of the economy to supply the goods and services. That’s why inflation is still there. So I understand why people would think that as things are slowing that should be a reason to lower interest rates, but we need to see the results in inflation before we can do that. Bullock later added that if inflation doesn’t come down, “then it might be that the best medicine is in fact that we have to end up putting more restriction into the economy”. Here’s a clip from Bill Shorten’s announcement earlier that he would be resigning from politics next February, for those who missed it: Victoria’s chief justice announces retirement Victoria’s chief justice, Anne Ferguson, has announced she will retire from the supreme court, AAP reports. The supreme court of Victoria announced her retirement, which will take effect from February 2025, today. Justice Ferguson was first appointed as a supreme court justice in 2010, she moved to the court of appeal in 2014 and then stepped into the chief’s role in 2017. She was involved in some of the state’s most high-profile cases, including Cardinal George Pell’s appeal over child sex abuse charges. Chief Justice Ferguson said in a statement: It has been a privilege to have served the Victorian community. I thank the judicial officers and staff from across this court, other jurisdictions and Court Services Victoria, together with the legal profession, for their commitment and dedication during my time as a judge of the Supreme Court. Justice Ferguson also served as chair of Courts Council, which oversees Court Services Victoria, and chair of the Judicial Commission of Victoria. Lidia Thorpe calls for questions on gender identity and sex characteristics to be reinstated in 2026 census Independent senator Lidia Thorpe is calling on the federal government to commit to including questions on gender identity and sex characteristics in the 2026 census. In a statement, Thorpe highlighted recent findings made by the Victorian coroner into the suicide deaths of five young transgender women. In her report, coroner Ingrid Giles noted a resounding theme of the inquest was the need for improved data collection on the trans and gender-diverse community. Thorpe said the decision to exclude questions on gender identity and sex characteristics is “appalling” and the government should “stick to their promise and reverse this decision.” This irresponsible and divisive decision will harm intersex, trans and gender diverse people. Not only because it singles them out to be left uncounted, but because it will have real impacts on people’s access to healthcare and services … We need accurate information that can tell us where intersex, trans and gender-diverse people are living so governments and organisations know where services are most needed. Former construction union officials have cited the upcoming federal election as cause to urgently hear their case against a law appointing administrators, asking the high court to expedite the matter to prevent them being politically sidelined. In court documents, seen by Guardian Australia, lawyers for Michael Ravbar and William Kane Lowth asked the court to direct the commonwealth to file its defence within a week, with a reply and agreed facts to follow in weeks for a case to be heard “as soon as possible”. The grounds of the case are that the law: breached the implied freedom of political communication; did not have a sufficient connection to a commonwealth power; and amounted to taking union property without “just terms” compensation. The plaintiffs argue that the act “has an impugned purpose of limiting or preventing” the construction union from making political donations, incurring expenditure and engaging in political communication. They noted the Coalition helped pass the bill in part because of a letter from the prospective administrator, Mark Irving, indicating he intended for the union not to promote candidates or make donations. In submissions arguing for the case to be expedited, lawyers said the case “involves pressing consequences” for the plaintiffs and the union and if the challenge is unsuccessful the administrator would benefit from “dispelling any concern” promptly. The construction union “intended to be involved – by way of advocacy, support of political parties, incurring electoral expenditure and making political donations – both prior to andduring the next federal election” which it can only do if the case is heard “expeditiously”. Guardian Australia understands the matter has been listed for directions on Friday. The government has said it will defend the case, and believes its law is constitutionally sound. More from the RBA governor’s speech in Sydney Continuing from our last post: The gist of Michele Bullock’s speech is mostly a recounting of the reason why the fight against inflation is the RBA’s priority, including over employment. While Bullock makes it clear the RBA is conscious of the pain being felt by households and businesses from higher interest rates, so far most are coping. “[D]espite the pressure on household budgets, only a small share of borrowers is currently at risk of falling behind on their mortgage repayments,” Bullock says, with the ongoing “strong” labour market key for people meeting their debt repayments. “Around 5%” of owner-occupiers with mortgages “are in a particularly challenging situation”, she said, echoing a number the RBA has used before. Stay tuned for the Q&amp;A session, where Bullock will no doubt be asked about GDP and whether the RBA is really “crashing the economy” as treasurer Jim Chalmers has said. In her first comments about the state of the economy since yesterday’s release of June quarter GDP figures, Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock doesn’t look like shifting from her view that interest rates aren’t about to be cut. Bullock has told the Anika Foundation Fundraising Lunch in Sydney: Circumstances may change, of course, and if economic conditions don’t evolve as expected, the board will respond accordingly. But if the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, the board does not expect that it will be in a position to cut rates in the near term. As Bullock herself notes, her assessment echoes the comments she made after the RBA’s most recent board meeting a month ago. Back then, “near term” meant not this year and since the board typically doesn’t meet in January, a rate cut would seem unlikely until February at the earliest. After yesterday’s GDP figures (which may mark the weakest point for the economy), investors were only giving about a 10% chance of a rate cut when the board meets on 23-24 September, according to the ASX rates tracker. There’s about a three-in-four chance of a cut by December. More to come in a moment. NTEU says Shorten’s first act as vice-chancellor should be review of institution’s governance The National Tertiary Education Union says Bill Shorten’s first act as the new vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra should be to undertake a review of the institution’s governance. The ACT division secretary, Dr Lachlan Clohesy, said Shorten needed to “know what he is walking into”, pointing to the previous vice-chancellor’s 71% pay increase prior to his resignation in January. Paddy Nixon’s package was $1.8m in 2023 compared with just over $1m in 2022. UC’s previous vice-chancellor received an unexplained $700,000 pay increase at a time when the university is financially starving … governance reform is necessary and overdue. We look forward to a productive and collaborative relationship with the new vice-chancellor, built on a basis of respect for staff and our shared union values, and based on our shared commitment to the future success of the University of Canberra. Asked to explain the increase, the university’s chancellor, Lisa Paul, told the Canberra Times the vice-chancellor’s salary and entitlements were “confidentially negotiated” with the University Council and would not comment further. Western Sydney University urging government to address $50k arts degrees The vice-chancellor of Western Sydney University says student debt is a “broken system” in a new call for the federal government to reduce the cost of skyrocketing arts degrees. Data released by the Department of Education in July confirmed the student contribution for a range of degrees including society and culture, communications, law and economics would jump to $16,992 annually from 2025, five years on from the widely condemned jobs ready graduates (JRG) scheme. Prof George Williams AO said the debt worked against the government’s stated aim of encouraging more diverse students into university. Two-thirds of students at Western Sydney University are the first in their family to attend university, while it also has the highest number of low SES students of any university. Western Sydney University urges the government to urgently act to fix a broken system, which has now pushed the cost of a three-year arts degree above $50,000. How does this imbalance, impacting equity groups, serve the minister’s commitment to make the system ‘fairer’? Kat McNamara has unseated the former NT chief minister Natasha Fyles in the electorate of Nightcliff, becoming the first Greens MP elected in territory history. McNamara is leading Fyles by only 33 votes on a re-count but is expected to claim the seat, in Darwin’s suburbs. Fyles, who resigned as chief minister last December, held the seat on a margin of more than 20%. Shorten’s departure fuels electoral excitement Bill Shorten’s election announcement has kickstarted the usual round of well-wishes from political friends and foes (everyone drops the hostilities for the farewells). Peter Dutton has wished Shorten well and Labor colleagues such as Victorian premier Jacinta Allan have paid tribute to the former Labor leader. Shorten, of course, is not leaving until February, and will remain in cabinet right until the end. But that doesn’t mean there are not eyes which have immediately turned to what the long time Maribyrnong MP’s departure will mean, electorally. The Greens are feeling invigorated – the party doesn’t have a candidate for Shorten’s electorate as yet, but are now eyeing it as a seat where they could cause some trouble for Labor. But Labor now has to defend Maribyrnong and Calwell in the north. There is also a strong campaign against Peter Khalil in Wills, which will stretch Labor resources even further. With the Victorian Labor government also starting to fall in popularity, Victoria is not looking so safe for Labor at the moment. Keep an eye on all of those moving parts. Greens preselect Ratnam replacement The Victorian Greens have preselected a Pacific health campaigner for the state seat vacated by the former party leader Samantha Ratnam. In a statement, the party says members have preselected Anasina Gray-Barberio for the northern metropolitan upper house seat – the party’s safest in the state. Ratnam, who announced earlier this year she would resign from state parliament, is contesting the federal seat of Wills at the next election. Gray-Barberio, who will take over the seat in October, says she wants to fight for secure and affordable housing and climate issues: As a Pasifika woman, I have a deep understanding of the threats posed by climate change, coming from a community that is on the frontline of the climate crisis. We’re in a critical decade for the climate, and people with lived experience and unique perspectives like mine deserve a seat at the table. Jacinta Allan reacts to Bill Shorten retirement news The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been asked about Bill Shorten’s retirement from federal politics. Speaking to reporters, Allan thanked Shorten for representing his constituents in the Melbourne seat of Maribyrnong: I’ve also known Bill personally for a really long time. We haven’t always seen eye to eye. We’ve had disagreements as federal and state politicians sometimes do but Bill has always come to his representative roles, as a union leader, as a local member of parliament and as a minister with a determination to make change. He’s always poured his heart and soul into that task. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, says former union boss John Setka’s appearances at two taxpayer-funded projects has been referred to Victoria police. The Age reported that Setka, the former Victorian construction secretary, delivered a speech yesterday to workers at the $1.5bn Footscray hospital project. The speech, which attacked the Albanese government, comes after Setka resigned from the union in July before the Age published allegations of criminal links within the union. Separately, Allan has confirmed Setka spoke to workers at a Metro Tunnel project site on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Allan says the director general of Victoria’s Big Build has referred Setka’s appearances to Victoria police for further investigation: I want to be clear at the outset that there is no place on Victorian Big Build work sites for John Setka. Dutton continues nuclear push despite latest report showing it ‘cannot make timely contribution’ to net zero Peter Dutton was also speaking about energy policy. This comes after the Climate Change Authority released its report today, identifying six things Australia must do to get the country largely off fossil fuels and reach net zero emissions. Adam Morton had all the details on this earlier in the blog, here. Despite evidence that nuclear “cannot make a timely contribution” to replacing retiring coal-fired power stations or helping achieve net zero by 2050 (see earlier comments from Matt Kean), Dutton is continuing his nuclear push. He told reporters: We’ve looked at the top 20 economies in the world and, in 19 of those, they are either adopting or have adopted nuclear power and Australia is the only country that has not. He also claimed that the “overwhelming … majority of Australians” now support nuclear energy, and “they do it because they know that when the prime minister says that the wind is free and the sun is free, that is rubbish.” Data from the Smart Energy Council, however, shows that the Coalition’s nuclear plan could cost taxpayers as much as $600bn while supplying just 3.7% of Australia’s energy mix by 2050. Dutton claims that a vote for a teal independent is a vote for Labor The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been speaking with reporters from Sydney. He has been taking aim at teal independents, and argued: What we know about the teals is that the majority of them are actually Green teals. They made themselves out to be disaffected Liberal voters that they are not. We know the green Teals vote consistently with the Greens are with the Labor party in the parliament, and if you are voting for a green Teal know that you are voting for Anthony Albanese. Queensland public transport patronage soars after fares slashed Public transport patronage has soared by up to 40.6% in Queensland, after the state government slashed fares to just 50 cents. According to an update by the transport department, all four transport modes have seen spikes compared with last year, and the number of trips overall have finally surpassed the pre-Covid peak. According to the Department of Transport and Main Roads: Bus ridership is up 12.1% Rail ridership is up 16% Light rail ridership is up 18.6% Ferry ridership is up 40.6% The number of trips overall is 2.4% higher than the pre-Covid average, and is 14.5% higher than a comparative period last year. About 30% to 40% more people are using public transport on weekends, compared with pre-Covid. The state government slashed fares from among the country’s most expensive to by far the cheapest on 5 August, as part of a six-month trial. Queensland goes to the polls on October 26. University of Canberra chancellor welcomes Bill Shorten after VC announcement The chancellor of the University of Canberra, Lisa Paul, has issued a message after news the former Labor leader Bill Shorten would become vice-chancellor from February next year. She said Shorten was unanimously chosen after an “exhaustive search and a rigorous merit-based selection process overseen by a selection committee of seven”. In February, Shorten will leave the government and politics to take up the positions of vice-chancellor and president. Paul said: Bill has made an enormous impact on Australia over his years in office. His advocacy for people with disability and for all who need support aligns perfectly with our university that has a firm commitment to reducing inequalities. Bill is passionate about the transformative power of education in changing lives – this is a value that is also close to my heart. Like many universities across Australia, UC is going through a significant time of change and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead of us. Bill’s wealth of experience will set us apart and situate UC to tackle the future from the strongest possible position. Interim vice-chancellor Prof Lucy Johnston will continue in the role until Shorten starts next year, Paul said. The Australian Electoral Commission has officially abolished the Higgins electorate in Victoria and created the Bullwinkel electorate in Western Australia. The new WA electorate is named after Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Bullwinkel, sole survivor of the 1942 Banka Island massacre. In a statement, the AEC said there would be “a very small increase in the number of electors who will change their electoral division” in Victoria. The AEC wrote on X: As the names [and] boundaries announced today are not considered to be significantly different from the initial proposal there will be no further public input. The new [Victorian] names and boundaries will be formally determined on 17 October 2024 with overview maps also becoming available. Optus and Vodafone have cleared a major hurdle in expanding their mobile network coverage through a network sharing arrangement, after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did not oppose the deal. The $1.6bn deal announced in April between Optus and Vodafone parent company TPG will see Optus using TPG spectrum in regional areas while TPG will be allowed to use Optus mobile network equipment in regional areas leading to a boost of mobile coverage for both companies in regional Australia. The ACCC said the agreement was unlikely to lessen competition in the mobile sector, and would allow better choice for consumers in regional locations. Vodafone said the move will allow it to double its mobile coverage – from around 400,000 square kilometres to around 1,000,000 square kilometres – across Australia from 2025. Kieren Cooney, Vodafone’s consumer executive director said: This is a huge win for customers and regional Australia, with our award-winning mobile services soon to be available in thousands of holiday destinations and regional communities across the country. Optus interim CEO Michael Venter said it would allow Optus to “press the fast forward button” on its 5G rollout in regional communities. The deal came after the competition tribunal knocked back a proposed network sharing arrangement between Vodafone and the largest provider, Telstra, last year. Bill Shorten says robodebt ‘should never have happened’ Taking his final question, Bill Shorten was asked about robodebt and whether he can reflect on the issue of accountability, what he says to victims and who will champion this inside government in future? Shorten said that “every Labor member is a champion for people who experience disadvantage”. On robodebt, he said it “should never have happened” and continued: The best thing I can say to victims is we invented the DeLorean and we can go back in time and make sure the law was never broken, but the DeLorean hasn’t been invented. What we can do is seek compensation for that, which we did in the class action, and we can hold the previous government to account, which we have. There is Coalition ministers who forever in their Wikipedia entry will have ‘they were robodebt ministers’. Most importantly, the public service and ministers need to learn that we have to understand the implications of policies before we do it. We will never again I hope see a chapter in Australia’s modern history we assume that people on welfare are cheats or second class. Access to our social service system is a human right backed by our commitment to United Nations conventions. I’m confident with the modern Services Australia we are reducing the waiting times on the phone, we’re getting the payments out. There is a definite change in culture … but we have more improvements to make. But if we never forget robodebt, that is our best chance never to forget it. A reporter asked for clarification on the date of the next election, and whether Bill Shorten had inadvertently “belled the cat” on a February election? Anthony Albanese said he hadn’t, and this is just when the academic year starts. He said he wasn’t going to tell Shorten to wait to begin the role “sometime between May or whenever it is” next year. Bill Shorten says his platform was ‘ambitious’ in 2019 election Bill Shorten was asked whether his “manifesto” in the 2016 and 2019 “was so ambitious, it turned people off”? In 2019, we did have an ambitious platform. The verdict came in, I accepted that. But I am proud that we put our propositions forward. Shorten said that Labor is “at its best when we know what we stand for and we will fight for things”. He was also asked about his legacy and said: I’m pleased that we brought the previous government justice over robodebt and I’m pleased also to have had the opportunity to lead Labor in 2013, and some of the years after. They were tough years but the whole team pulled together. It was never just me and each of my accomplishments, it’s not just me and I’ve been fortunate to have a lucky role in it. Albanese says there may be a gap between Shorten retiring and new member being elected A reporter asked Bill Shorten whether there is someone he has in mind to replace him in the seat of Maribyrnong? He responded: There are a lot of great locals in Maribyrnong who could replace me. One thing is for sure: that I will be replaced. The national executive nomination close next week and I know of a couple of good candidates but I think today is about this and let’s see what emerges in coming days. The PM, Anthony Albanese, said a process would begin to select a candidate: The election is due by next May. There is some precedent for there being a gap for a short period of time. Minister Shorten will continue to serve until February. It is possible there will be a small gap where the electorate office continues to serve the interests of the people, but of course Bill had this opportunity come before him. Bill Shorten was also asked on his role in the removal of Kevin Rudd in 2010 and Julia Gillard to a lesser extend in 2013. How do you reflect on those now? Do you have regrets about that all they are necessary part of the process of politics? Shorten responded by quoting My Way by Frank Sinatra: Regrets ... I might borrow from someone else. Regrets, I’ve had a few, but then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do but much more than this, I did it my way. Our own Paul Karp asked the following question: The 2019 election platform to reform franking credits, negative gearing and capital gains tax, it is full of ideas which now have support not just from the Greens but also the lower house and the Senate crossbench. Were these ideas before their time, and is that a road map for Labor to do more on housing affordability and inequality? Bill Shorten said he was proud of taking policies to the 2019 election “where we were honest and upfront.” Some of the ideas, and I’m not referring particularly to yours, were bold and audacious. But this government has been able to succeed because they got elected and implementing some of the threads of the hard work from climate change, to A Future Made in Australia, to training our apprentices. In terms of the tax reform propositions, the reality is that the verdict of the people was that they were not ready for that and where we were going on focusing on supply, building more housing, I think is the sensible, realistic proposition which brings people together and we have got a very ambitious program which we are rolling out. Q: Not everybody survives mentally when they lose leadership, or they lose power. What is your advice to fellow politicians on how to survive that? Bill Shorten responded: No one in my family was ever a politician. Some of my British relatives came to see me before the 2019 election and they knew my grandmother. She lived in public housing … She was an air raid warden in the second world war, she was a cleaner … My English family said it would be unimaginable to my grandmother, the idea that her grandson had the opportunity to run in parliament and to indeed run for prime minister. I don’t worry about what hasn’t been, I think I am really lucky. I have had the chance to help create, defend and improve the NDIS. I have had the very privileged position to lead Labor. I have had the chance to help the victims of robodebt. Every day in this job and I’m sure every member of parliament agrees, is a privileged day and as I said earlier, despite the ups and downs, there is not a single day I would hand back in the 17 years. Bill Shorten is now taking questions from reporters. He said the council of the University of Canberra unanimously approved him yesterday at 4pm, and he will be moving to Canberra next year to complete the role of vice chancellor. Bill Shorten said that like many people in their 50s, he has started to think about what comes next – whether to seek another term, or step into a new career while he is “relatively young enough to make that choice”. From February next year, he will be vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra. Education is the modern means of taking someone from disadvantage to advantage in a way that no other method can. Universities have a critical role to play … I’m looking forward to joining university that had been rated number one in the world for reducing inequalities, where 40% of graduates of the first in family to obtain a degree. That was my mother’s story, so for me this is the fair go in action. Bill Shorten said there is “not a single day in the last 17 years” that he would hand back, amid “some extraordinary political highs … [and] let’s face it, some extraordinary political lows.” Every day I know how lucky I have been to have the privilege to serve the Australian people … Bill Shorten also sent a message to people with disability, their carers and people who love and work with them. The NDIS minister said he helped create and prepare the scheme, and “will always defend it.” I will use every minute left in this job to secure the future of the scheme and ensure it continues to empower with choice and control and give Australians with disability the chance to fulfil their potential, and the same goes for every Australian who relies on Services Australia. Shorten on his time as Labor leader: ‘We didn’t win every battle but Labor never stopped trying’ Bill Shorten is now reflecting on his time as Labor leader, coming in after the 2013 election. He said the party was reduced to 55 seats and had suffered its “worst result since 1996”. We were up against an ascendant Abbott government with a fierce ideological agenda and the 2014 budget was the centre of that … They were walking away from renewable energy, turning our back on climate action. If you look back at the commentary at the time, there were many who said Labor should simply roll over … [and] there were some who argued it would be smart politics for us to let people feel the pain of these cuts but instead, a united team, we decided to back ourselves … We look to Australians not just for their approval, we trusted in the instinct for fairness … Not every idea succeeded, I understand that. We didn’t win every battle but Labor never stopped trying. Whether it was defending Medicare or real action on climate, marriage equality, advancing First Nations representation in our ranks, championing wages and conditions, setting a target of 50% women MPs by 2025, the banking royal commission or tax reform. These were hard fights or worth having. Shorten says there is ‘plenty more work to be done’ Bill Shorten said that his career would not have been possible “without the tremendous love, patience, support from Chloe (his wife), Rupert, Georgette and Clementine.” The sacrifices they have made. Chloe has been a tower of love and strength and I think she has shown more courage than I’d dream could exist. I will thank others later, because today is not valedictory. There’s plenty more work to be done. Bill Shorten is now speaking to reporters in Canberra, saying “I have decided not to seek a seventh term in parliament”. He said that when he joined the Australian Workers’ Union more than 30 years ago, he did so “driven by the belief that everyone, regardless of circumstance, deserves an equal opportunity”. The same principle that brought me here in 2007. A determination to always stand up for the underdog. Shorten said politicians in the end are “all just passing through” and what matters is “whether we leave the place better than we found it”. That is a challenge I have always been up for. It is why we are so proud to serve in the Albanese government. I genuinely consider myself to be one of the luckiest people in politics. Albanese on Shorten: ‘No one worked harder than Bill. No one brought more energy’ Continuing, Anthony Albanese told reporters: I want [Bill Shorten] to finish the work is to secure the best possible outcome for people with disability, their and carers. Equally, I know that Bill is very determined to see the job through. The PM said only a few people are given the “extraordinary privilege of leading Australia’s oldest and greatest political party” and Shorten took over “in the wake of a demoralising 2013 defeat”. He united the party, he re-energised the caucus, he saw off two prime ministers and rebuilt Labor into a strong opposition and a genuine alternative government. Through his years as leader, no one worked harder than Bill. No one brought more energy, enthusiasm, ideas and ambition to advocating the need for a Labor government. It is a measure of Bill’s character that he channelled the disappointment of 2019 into fighting for justice for the victims of robodebt. Albanese thanked Shorten for his contribution as a minister in his government, and or his “decades of service he has given to the Labor movement”. The government services and NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, is now fronting the media in Canberra alongside the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. As Amy Remeikis just reported, Shorten will retire from federal politics at the next election. Albanese is first to speak, and said he and Shorten had had a number of conversations around this: I think it is a credit to Bill that this news will come as a surprise because at no point in the past two and a bit years would any observer of Australian politics think that Bill Shorten was taking it easy or slowing down. Albanese has asked Shorten to remain in cabinet until he departs in February “because he and I agreed there is important work still to be done to put the National Disability Insurance Scheme on a sustainable footing”. Bill Shorten will retire from federal politics at the next election, it has been confirmed. Labor sources said the former Labor leader had been speaking about leaving for some time. It was known to be happening before the next election, but the timing was not confirmed. Anthony Albanese is expected to make the announcement at a press conference in the next 10 minutes. Shorten is believed to be making the announcement now to give the party time to embed a new candidate in his Melbourne seat of Maribyrnong, which he has held since 2007. More to come. Actor Christie Whelan Browne says she has settled her sex discrimination case with Oldfield Entertainment outside of court. Last year, Browne brought a lawsuit against the theatre company alleging victimisation after she complained of alleged harassment by Craig McLachlan, her castmate in a 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Show. The federal court lawsuit has been filed against the theatrical company and did not seek relief from McLachlan. In a statement shared to Instagram today, Browne said she was “extremely happy with the outcome” and that she was able to “avoid the pain of another trial.” The past 18 months has taken a huge toll on me. But there will come a day, in the future, when I have healed, where I will be able to look back and be proud that I stood up for myself. There is nothing more to say on the subject. It’s done. And I’m free. Teal independent says Pittwater by-election opportunity to ‘raise the bar’ As we reported earlier, teal independent Jacqui Scruby has today announced her candidacy for the upcoming Pittwater by-election in New South Wales. In a post to X, Scruby said the 19 October by-election would be “a much needed chance to raise the bar” on issues such as “the cost of raising a family today, running a business, and protecting our beautiful corner of the world.” As an Independent, my focus will be on serving the local community, not party politics… As a local mum who knows what it’s like to run a small business, I have seen how hard the past couple of years have been for families and businesses on the peninsula. My promise to Pittwater is that honesty, fairness and integrity will be at the heart of everything I do… As an Independent I’ll have a seat at the table to tackle these issues, rather than being ineffective from opposition. It’s going to take an almighty effort to win this one. Queensland’s premier Steven Miles has defended his government’s decision to consider bailing out casino operator Star Entertainment for the second day in a row. The state government is reportedly considering delaying a $300m tax bill from the company, which opened part of the giant Queen’s Wharf casino and resort precinct in Brisbane last week. Miles today said the government’s first priority is to “try to protect these 1,400 jobs.” It might not work, and those 1,400 Queenslanders would lose those jobs, but I think it’s appropriate for the government to look to what we can do to try to protect those jobs. Miles said if the company goes into administration after offering a tax deferment the government would become a creditor “and we’d be treated the same way as other creditors”. The United Workers’ Union, which represents casino employees, yesterday called on the governments of both New South Wales and Queensland to do “everything they can to keep Star’s doors open.” Miles said: My message to them is that we’re working hard to try to ensure we can keep their jobs. But we are concerned, just as they are, this is a very concerning situation; 1,400 Queenslanders who had been counting on having long term secure jobs at a fantastic new integrated resort facility, right now, need to be concerned for their jobs, and we’re concerned for them too. ACTU calling on financial companies to drop prices amid increasing profits The Australian Council of Trade Unions is calling on the country’s biggest financial companies to drop prices, after the ABS released data showing a 46% increase in profits since March 2021. According to a statement from the ACTU, the cost of insurance and financial services has been one of the key drivers of inflation over the past 12 months, increasing by 6.4% from higher premiums and mortgage rates. The union said companies have hiked insurance premiums by 36% since March 2021 and according to the Australia Institute, the banks have pocketed $212bn from raising interest payments on households and businesses. Recent announcements show the Commonwealth Bank posted a $9.48bn profit; IAG recorded insurance profits of $1.42bn, up 79.1% from the previous financial year; Suncorp posted a $801m profit from its insurance arm, a 17% increase; and QBE posted a nearly 100% increase in profits, of $802m for its half-yearly results. ACTU secretary Sally McManus argued in a statement that “banks and insurance companies are having a lend of Australians.” They have put up prices, not because they need to, but to fatten their profits. This type of profiteering and price gouging is deeply offensive to working people who continue to struggle with cost of living pressures. Big businesses like banks and insurance companies are keeping inflation higher than it should be and they need to be held responsible for this. The evidence is clear that corporate profiteering and price gouging are fuelling inflation… Unions have no tolerance for these big businesses cashing in on the struggles of working people. The Uniting Church has backed Victoria’s treaty process in a public statement of support, ahead of negotiations beginning in the coming months. The First Peoples’ Assembly – a democratically elected Indigenous body – will begin negotiating a state-wide treaty with the Allan government in the coming weeks. The treaty will focus on issues affecting all First Nations Victorians. The statement by the Uniting Church’s Victorian and Tasmania synods says it will commit to supporting and advocating for the treaty process: We acknowledge that the past cannot be altered or erased, but we choose to take steps today that will foster healing in the enduring pain caused by injustices. Church leaders appeared at Victoria’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry earlier this year and discussed the role the institutions had played in running missions that harmed First Nations people. Star Entertainment’s board of directors says the company is currently reviewing its financial and liquidity position, seeking to finalise its preliminary financial report for 2024. Last week, The Star entered a trading halt after an inquiry into the casino operator handed down its report. And earlier this week, it was suspended from trading by the ASX “for not lodging the relevant periodic report by the due date”. In a market announcement today, the board said it is working to finalise its FY2024 preliminary financial report “although the timing of its release has not been finalised”. The release said: The Star is currently reviewing its financial and liquidity position with various advisers in the context of seeking to finalise its preliminary financial report for the financial year eded 30 June 2024 (FY24), including holding discussions with various stakeholders in relations to its liquidity position in light of adverse trading and other conditions. The Star said it would provide a further update in line with the release of the report. Upon release of the FY2024 preliminary financial report, the Company’s shares would resume trading in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules. Maritime union joins CFMEU’s ‘fight for justice’ Unions are banding together to support a high court challenge after the CFMEU was placed into administration, AAP reports. The Maritime Union of Australia will join other trade unions to help fund the CFMEU’s legal battle, claiming the federal government’s decision was “unjustified, chaotic and reckless”. Putting the construction union into administration had both short and long-term consequences, the maritime workers’ group warned. It could jeopardise progress on enterprise bargaining agreements, send a green light to “bad and abusive employers” or set a precedent for moves against other unions based on “untested media allegations”. The MUA said in a statement yesterday: We are supporting … and backing them in as they fight for the right of their division to exist. We are also concerned by the near certainty that similar future legislation will be used by governments of either stripe against other militant blue-collar unions, including the MUA. We have been on the receiving end of these calculated political and media smears in the past and will support our fellow members … as they seek to clear their names and fight for the principles of natural justice, presumption of innocence, the rules of evidence and procedural fairness. B-double fire on Sydney’s M5 causing heavy traffic and delays A B-double truck is on fire on the M5 at Moorebank, creating heavy traffic conditions approaching the Hume Highway. Fire and Rescue NSW says its firefighters are working to extinguish the fire. According to Live Traffic NSW, three of four westbound lands have closed and there are heavy traffic conditions. Emergency services, Transport for NSW and motorway crew are attending, it said. Motorists are advised to reduce their speed to 40km/h, expect delays and prepare to merge. Final NSW firefighters return from Canada after assisting to battle wildfires The New South Wales RFS says its final contingent of personnel have returned from Canada, landing back in Sydney earlier this morning. The first deployment left NSW for Canada in July, to assist in battling more than 650 severe summer wildfires in the country. The RFS wrote on X today: The team were met by Deputy Commissioner Peter McKechnie, who thanked all for their work in supporting the Canadian communities. Here are some more details on that report from the Climate Change Authority, as we just flagged, which has identified six things Australia must do to get the country largely off fossil fuels and reach net zero emissions. They are included in a review of what needs to happen in different parts of the economy to cut climate pollution. The report, called a sector pathways review, says getting to net zero is heavily reliant on the power sector, which needs to both rapidly cut emissions and double its output to support increased demand for electricity. That has not been going well recently. After years of rapid reductions, emissions cuts from the electricity grid have stalled. You can read more on that here. The government has responded by backing a substantially boosted capacity investment scheme – an underwriting program for renewable energy and storage – to deliver 32 gigawatts by 2030. The authority’s report is not policy prescriptive. It says the country needs to overcome an unwillingness to pay a “green premium” (the relatively higher price of some green technologies when the cost of emissions are not factored in), slow and complicated development approval processes, a lack of community support for new technology, supply chains constraints, workforce shortages and data gaps. The authority is tasked with advising the federal government on policy and targets. Kean says outcome of US election would impact Australia in ‘global effort to get to net zero’ Matt Kean suggested the outcome of the upcoming US election would impact upon Australia’s climate change ambitions, and was asked to expand on this: We’ll be interested to see the result. Obviously, the Biden administration is leading the way when it comes to moving towards net zero. They have clearly ambitious plans which Australia is aligned with… Australia doesn’t operate in isolation. We operate in a global environment. There’s a suggestion, if a Trump administration steps back from their commitments that other nations will step up to the plate. We’re expecting countries in Europe, across the Asias, to do more of the heavy lifting. So we’ll have a look at what the context is that Australia will be operating in. This is a global effort to get to net zero, not just an Australian effort. We’ll do our bit. We want to make sure we’re doing our bit in the context of the geopolitical environment. Ahead of the next election, Matt Kean was asked about the two very different energy policies being presented – nuclear, by the opposition, and renewables, by the government – and how net zero by 2050 can work amid such a big political contest? Kean said he would “leave that to the political actors” and said: We’ve been asked by the Australian parliament to provide independent and technical advice on how the major sectors of the Australian economy can decarbonise. This report that we’re releasing today sets out that pathway … We’re going to effectively need to reorganise our public and private finances, supply chains, production systems, industrial zones, energy sources, infrastructure, workforces within Australia – it is absolutely possible, though, we set out a clear pathway to how to achieve that. Pressed for his thoughts on how nuclear would fit into this, Kean said the report makes it clear “Australia has a lack of experience in building and managing nuclear power stations, and that will reasonably lead to additional costs”. The estimated lead time, as identified in the report, says that it will take 15 to 20 years before a nuclear power plant would become operational. So the report suggests [nuclear] technology cannot make a timely contribution to replacing the generation capacity of retiring coal fired power stations, or to helping Australia achieve its carbon budget targets to 2050. Kean says approval process ‘confusion’ across jurisdictions is a barrier to new energy projects The review also suggests the government needs to reform development approval processes – what sort of reform is needed? Matt Kean said one of the major barriers to getting new energy infrastructure approved is “the confusion of the planning processes across the different jurisdictions.” Each of the states and territories has different approaches to approving major nation building infrastructure. What we’re suggesting is those planning approval processes need to be streamlined. We don’t set out a clear policy to do that, but we identify the problem, and want to work with the different jurisdictions to ensure that we get a process that ensures that community consultation occurs, but also that investors and developers have certainty to build the new generation that we need, and we need it very quickly. Climate Change Authority report identifies what highest emitting sectors must do to achieve net zero The former New South Wales treasurer and chairman of the Climate Change Authority Matt Kean was on ABC RN earlier to discuss a long-awaited review, released today, identifying what the economy’s top six emitting sectors must do to achieve net zero. Speaking about the report overall, Kean said it showed “we’re making good progress on decarbonising our economy, but there are opportunities for us to do more and go faster”. Of the six sectors, Kean said electricity and energy could to the “bulk of the heavy lifting in the short to medium term”: It contributes 35% of Australia’s total emissions, and we already have technologies available that can not only help reduce those emissions but if we deploy wind, solar, batteries and firming at scale for families and businesses across the nation [it will] grow our economy. So it’s a win-win. Asked how to get broad community support around this, Kean stressed that by 2035, 90% of coal-fired electricity will be coming to the end of its technical life. It has nothing to do with climate change. It has everything to do with the fact that these are old machines, and what we need to do is replace them before they come to end of life, to ensure not only a reliable system, but also affordable electricity that underwrites our economy for the next generation. We have technology available to do that right now. NSW council crackdown coming after stack of trivial complaints The “fundamentally broken” code of conduct applied to New South Wales local councils is set for reform, AAP reports, as officials blame a stack of trivial complaints for bogging down the system. The state government has launched a discussion paper that also proposes banning private councillor briefing sessions and strengthening lobbying guidelines in a bid to improve transparency. The 100-page rule book governing council conduct would be re-written as a two- or three-page document similar to the one used to oversee state governments. The move to trim down trivial complaints comes after nearly 4300 conduct complaints in the past three years, which local government minister Ron Hoenig said highlighted a “fundamentally broken” system: It is too open to weaponisation, with tit-for-tat complaints diverting critical council resources and ratepayer money from the things that matter most to communities. The paper suggests only ‘serious’ matters about conflicts of interest would be examined by the Office of Local Government. A local government privileges committee featuring former mayors would assess misbehaviour complaints, and private investigators would be removed from the councillor conduct process. Hoenig said: For far too long the system has been abused. It’s time to restore public confidence in councils and ensure the dignity of this vital third tier of government is upheld. Yesterday afternoon in Western Australia, the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds emerged from the David Malcolm Justice Centre in Perth’s CBD to express relief that the five-week defamation trial she brought against Brittany Higgins was “finally over”. Reynolds, flanked by her lawyer Martin Bennett, said she was “very glad” to tell her truth in an attempt to “stop the publications”. The former defence minister sued Higgins, her former staffer, over social media posts from July 2023 that she alleges damaged her reputation. Reynolds said the trial had “absolutely” taken a toll on her and “everybody” she loved. It was very good for me, after three-and-a-half years, to be able to tell my story and [for] my family and friends and colleagues to also be able to tell the truth … [I feel] a great sense of relief. Higgins did not attend the trial in person and her legal team did not offer any media statement at the trial’s conclusion on Wednesday afternoon. Teal independent Jacqui Scruby will today announce her candidacy for the upcoming Pittwater by-election in New South Wales, following the resignation of former MP Rory Amon. Scruby ran against Amon at the 2023 state election, who won the seat by just 606 votes. Scruby achieved a historic 22% swing against the Liberal Party during the election. Amon has been charged with 10 child sexual assault offences against a teenage boy after an investigation into an alleged assault on Sydney’s northern beaches. He said in a statement he denied all the charges and was resigning from state parliament. He also resigned from the Liberal party. Scruby is an environmental lawyer and corporate climate change advisor, who will announce her candidacy this morning alongside federal Independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps and NSW Independent MP Michael Regan. Taylor says ‘you don’t solve the cost of living crisis by throwing money at it’ Angus Taylor was asked if he would back relief for Australian households who are doing it tough? He said he would wait to see any specific proposal: What I would say, as a matter of principle, is you don’t solve the cost of living crisis like this by throwing money at it. The government is now fighting on two fronts … Number one is inflation is stuck. Core inflation hasn’t moved since January, unlike every other major advanced country in the world … and that’s why we’re seeing interest rate cuts in other countries, but not in Australia. But at the same time, the GDP per capita going backwards now for 18 months, six consecutive quarters, [is] completely unprecedented … And just throwing some money at it … that’s the wrong answer. It’s not going to solve it. Asked if he still thinks cuts are necessary, Taylor said “managing spending growth is critical”. Shadow treasurer says Labor not using all levers to get economy ‘back on its feet’ Q: The RBA governor has said there will be no interest rate cuts this year, and the deputy governor talked about the economy running hotter. Did the RBA get those things wrong, if you look at the GDP number? Angus Taylor says that was has been wrong is the government’s forecast of policies. The Reserve Bank has one lever, it’s interest rates. The government has many, many levers – whether it’s productivity policies, industrial relations, immigration policy, energy policy. They have lever after lever available to them to get the economy back on its feet. They’re not using them, that is very very clear, and the result is we’ve got an absolutely disastrous situation for households. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, was also up on ABC RN this morning to discuss yesterday’s GDP figures. Asked if it would be dangerous to cut government spending back now, Taylor responded that what the economy is now experiencing is “worse than anaemic growth”: What households or Australians feel in the economy isn’t the aggregate outcome, it’s the outcome per person, per household. And of course, that’s going backwards. It’s gone backwards now for six quarters in a row, 18 months, and the result of it is that Australians standard of living has fallen by nine over 9% since Labor came to power. So it’s a disastrous economic situation … Under those circumstances, if you add to spending … it adds to inflation. That’s the situation that economists are making very, very clear right now. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has been making the rounds this morning and also spoke with Patricia Karvelas on ABC RN. She was asked to provide more detail on the “substantial package” the PM will take to national cabinet to address violence against women, as she flagged earlier this morning. Gallagher flagged the package would be focused towards frontline services: The PM will have more to say about it … but I think the approach we’ll see from the Commonwealth is that we don’t want this to be a states-versus-Commonwealth argy-bargy party … We want it to be the Commonwealth showing the leadership that we need to show, prepared to put some dollars on the table, and we want to shift the dial here. We want to see an end to gender based violence in this country, not only the social impacts of that but of the huge economic cost of that as well. And of course, for all those women and children who experience it, we want that to end… I think we’ve heard loud and clear that people want extra investment in frontline services, and that is a real focus. ‘We are going to work on how those questions get presented’: Husic on census questions Moving to the census issue, Ed Husic was asked whether he thought some of the questions around gender identity were too complex. A report in the SMH yesterday stated that Anthony Albanese complained the new questions about a person’s gender identity were inappropriate and he had to step in to fix the problem. Husic responded: I think that the minister that is responsible, and particularly … off the back of the signal issued by the PM, we are going to be dealing with this issue. We are going to work on how those questions get presented, and we’ve got time between now and 2026 to do that. Ed Husic said that AI is the “most complex public policy issue that governments the world over are dealing with”. While we’re keen to work with business on improving AI safety, it recognises governments – and particularly the Australian government recognises that you need to have confidence that comes from having the rules set out properly… Over the next four weeks, we’ll be working on the shape of the mandatory guardrails. [We’re] sending the signal now that businesses can get involved and use the voluntary standard, we need to have something concrete and that’s also what we’re flagging to business and also to the wider Australian public. Ed Husic said bridge between ‘best intention and best practice’ needed when it comes to AI As Paul Karp reported earlier this morning, the Australian government is considering a European Union-style Artificial Intelligence Act to regulate minimum standards on high-risk AI across the whole economy. The industry and science minister, Ed Husic, spoke with ABC News Breakfast about this earlier and noted that 80% of businesses in Australia think they’re doing the right thing, but only about 30% are putting in place the responsible practices required to use AI. So what we need to do is create that bridge between best intention and best practice. That’s what we’re trying to do with the work we’re releasing today around the guardrail, which is identify the risk and make business aware of those risks, and then show them the guardrails – the ways in which they can deal with those risks. Thomas Mayo wants government to do more on truth-telling and not ‘walk away’ from Uluru Statement The leading Yes campaigner Thomas Mayo was also up on ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning to speak about his new book, Always Was, Always Will Be: The Campaign for Justice and Recognition Continues. Asked if he still felt as if he was being used as a political football, Mayo responded: I think bipartisanship is important and it saddens and angers me when I see politicians using us for their own political opportunity. We saw that with the Coalition last year. The biggest factor in the referendum failing – and you can see the analysis from 60% support for years because of the work that we did from 2019 to about 2022, flipping to 60% against in that time when one of the major parties decided to make it their opportunity. Mayo said he would like to see leaders “have some backbone” and “stand up to those that don’t want truth-telling”. I can’t understand why anybody would, you know, would be against some form of truth-telling about our past and that’s the best way to go forward with the best decisions about what can happen. So I really want to see the federal government do more on truth-telling and not walk away from the Uluru Statement. Mayo penned this piece for Guardian Australia last week, which you can read below: Gallagher flags package to address violence against women Katy Gallagher, who is also the minister for women, was asked about tomorrow’s national cabinet and whether she would discuss with her state and territory colleagues the crisis facing women in violent relationships. She said Anthony Albanese would be “taking a very substantial package to national cabinet and obviously trying to work with the states and territories on that”. But we’re certainly very serious about responding to the crisis and part of that is putting, you know, extra investment on the table and the PM will have more to say about that over the next couple of days. Moving to the 2026 census, Katy Gallagher was asked about comments from some of Australia’s major health institutions who say data on gender diverse Australians will be critical to inform care. Is that something the government will consider, given that this is the advice from a lot of major health bodies? Gallagher responded that the ABS already collects data “including on sex and gender through a number of different surveys, so there’s already a lot of collection of information”. It is, as you say, really important and it’s no surprise that health groups are saying that because, you know, it informs future health policy and identifies gaps and responses. Gallagher said that on the census more broadly, “it’s in 2026” and her focus this week is on the cost of living. But the PM has already said there will be questions. We need to work with people about what those questions are and we’ll be doing that, but I’m very positive there’ll be a good outcome here. Treasurer’s comment that interest rates are ‘smashing the economy’ is ‘stating facts’, Gallagher says The finance minister was also asked about those comments from treasurer Jim Chalmers at the weekend, that the interest rates set by the RBA are “smashing the economy” – comments he has stood by all week. Katy Gallagher said “the language the treasurer used – and I used it myself – is really stating the facts as they are.” You can see that from this data. You can see that household consumption, particularly on discretionary spending [which has] really declined substantially. I think that shows that household budgets are smashed and contributing to that, of course, is those 13 interest rate increases. And the bank’s got a job to do to get inflation down, but we have also got a job to do to explain what we’re seeing in the economy and what we know is happening and that is that households are under huge pressure. So I think, you know, there’s been a lot said about this this week but it really is stating the facts and [that] played out for all to see in the national accounts yesterday. Cost-of-living the number one issue in every Australian household: Gallagher Q: Are you concerned about the electoral implications of this for Australians? Katy Gallagher responded that “Australians want their government to make the right decisions for the right economic times”. That’s been our focus. We are absolutely understanding of people’s pressures, those cost-of-living issues are the main issue right across the economy and in every household in Australia and that’s why, you know, trying to get wages moving and looking at what we can do on tax cuts, energy bill relief, is so important. But we’ve got to do it in a way [that] doesn’t add to the inflation challenge because that obviously hurts in the longer term. Finance minister responds to yesterday’s GDP figures The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, was on ABC News Breakfast just earlier after the release of the latest GDP numbers yesterday. She said the data shows “obviously some clear challenges in the economy” and that public investment is needed and “appropriate when we’re going through such difficult times.” Asked about claims from the opposition that the government’s support measures have been ‘a Band-Aid on a bullet hole’, Gallagher responded: “I don’t take economic advice from the opposition.” Obviously, they’re there to make a political point. Our focus, Jim [Chalmers] and my focus, is really on making the right decisions for the right time. That’s why, you know, in the budget, we made some decisions about cost-of-living support. I think some of the opposition policies, which is to make $100bn worth of cuts at a minimum, if they were in government and doing that, you would have seen a very different set of results. Comparison site says mortgage stress at highest levels since 2019 The comparison site Finder says it’s consumer sentiment tracker last month recorded the highest level of mortgage stress since it began tracking in early 2019. More than two in five (42%) of homeowners struggled to pay their home loan in August, and 13% missed one or more mortgage repayments in the past six months, Finder says. Owner-occupiers are, on average, taking out larger loans than ever before despite the fact the cash rate is sitting at a 12-year-high, Finder says. The average owner-occupier mortgage is now $634,479 – up by 1.3% from the previous month and up by 9.3% from the previous year, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Richard Whitten, home loans expert at Finder, says: Million of mortgage holders have managed rate hikes so far, but now they’re facing severe financial strain as their savings and emergency funds dry up. Housing is increasingly becoming a major source of stress for Australians, with many struggling to keep afloat. Finder’s figures are based on 19,137 mortgage holders between May 2019 and August 2024, and 333 mortgage holders for August 2024. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us this Thursday! I’m Emily Wind and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of today. As always, you can reach out with any tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s get started. While the insipid 0.2% growth posted in the last quarter is unlikely to surprise Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock, weak productivity and strong public spending may prove cause for concern, AAP reports. A slower economy is an expected consequence of higher interest rates, jacked up and kept elevated to weaken demand and bring down inflation. With yesterday’s growth figures roughly in line with the RBA’s expectations, ANZ economists were not expecting a material shift in its thinking ahead of Bullock’s speech to the Anika Foundation today. Household spending did come in notably weaker than forecasts but ANZ’s Catherine Birch and Adam Boyton said tax relief and energy bill rebates should give disposable incomes a boost. They wrote in a note: Which should see a gradual lift in household spending growth. EY chief economist Cherelle Murphy was unimpressed by Wednesday’s data, singling out weak productivity performance and strong government spending as reasons for the central bank to hold off on rate cuts. This is the worst possible combination of statistics, as it means Australian businesses are gaining very little from government spending, which is focused on short-term cost-of-living relief for households and band-aid fixes to neglected problems. Our reporter Luca Ittimani has been speaking to the owner of a once-bustling Sydney cafe who has seen his trade fall off a cliff. Brett Harris, who runs the Balkan Butler in Surry Hills in Sydney, says: People just aren’t here, there’s not as many bodies. Where are they? What are they doing? Now the economy is on its knees, will the RBA start cutting rates? Yesterday’s GDP figures were among the worst for years with only population growth and government spending keeping the economy afloat. With his usual razor-sharp chart-based analysis, Greg Jericho identifies one of the key problems: in the March 2022 quarter, Australians were paying $479 a quarter per person in interest repayments compared with $1,112 now. He argues the Reserve Bank must realise its mistake in hiking rates and start to cut them before the situation gets worse. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you some of the main overnight and breaking news stories before Emily Wind starts. The controversy over the census questions takes a new turn today as several major health institutes have called for a rethink because the excluded data is “critical” for identifying health needs. The group, including the Kirby Institute, the Centre for Social Research in Health and the Australian Human Rights Institute, released a joint statement saying the questions were needed to fill in gaps in much-needed research. After yesterday’s anaemic growth figures, attention will be on the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, when she gives a speech in Sydney at midday. There are growing calls for the bank to start cutting interest rates after a sustained period of high borrowing costs has helped dampen inflation but sucked demand out of the economy at the same time. We have analysis coming up of yesterday’s numbers, and we’ll have details of Bullock’s speech when we get them. A team of researchers at the University of Sydney have been awarded this year’s Eureka prize for environmental research for their work on how to protect crops and endangered species by using odours to confuse predators. The journey began two decades ago when Peter Banks noticed mice peeing when they escaped from rodents: They were just putting their smell everywhere. And I went, ‘how about if we use that principle of the smell of prey being everywhere to stop predators from finding their food?’"

                    "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is using artificial intelligence to advise shoppers on their outfit choices based on their body shape and style preferences, as part of efforts to increase online sales. The 130-year-old retailer is using the technology to personalise consumers’ online experience, and suggest items to buy. Stephen Langford, the company’s director of online, said M&amp;S was using AI to adapt the language used to address shoppers, tailoring to six different preferences such as emotional, descriptive language or more straightforward prose. One of its aims is to personalise online interactions with shoppers, he said, such as prioritising products most relevant for an individual. Male shoppers would be less likely to be offered the latest deals on bras, for example. Shoppers can also opt to fill out a quiz about their size, body shape and style preferences to receive relevant outfit ideas created by M&amp;S’s AI-driven technology. Langford said 450,000 M&amp;S shoppers had used the quiz so far, which can pick outfits from 40m options. The service combines ideas from the £7bn company’s in-house stylists with information from the shopper to offer tips on which types of garment may go together. The automation of product descriptions using AI has risen to 80% from almost nothing in the past year, although Langford added: “We still need a human in the process” to sense-check the output. Richard Price, the managing director of clothing and home for M&amp;S, said it was “turbo-charging online” with the aim of clocking up half its fashion sales digitally by 2028, up from about one-third now. The retailer, which has 240 full-line stores and 325 food outlets, reported a 41% jump in profits last year while sales rose 9.4% to £13bn. Online fashion and homeware sales rose by 7.8% at M&amp;S last financial year. M&amp;S attracted 1 million more customers last year, two-thirds of whom came via the internet. The increase in online sales has partly been driven by an 80% rise in spending on social media marketing and advertising year on year, with the company now spending more on the likes of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok than on TV. Almost a third of its revenue generated via TikTok comes from completely new customers. Launching the retailer’s autumn ranges on Wednesday, Price said M&amp;S had taken the largest share of the womenswear market in nine years this summer, despite what he called a “tough” season amid cool and wet conditions until late July. The retailer has long been the market leader in clothing categories such as knitwear and lingerie, but it has been gaining market share in other areas, including denim. It hopes to overtake Next to become the biggest seller of garments for occasions as the winter party season approaches."

                    "bodyText": "The Australian government is considering a European Union-style artificial intelligence act to regulate minimum standards on high-risk AI across the whole economy. On Wednesday the industry and science minister, Ed Husic, released a discussion paper proposing 10 “mandatory guardrails” for high-risk AI including human oversight and the ability to challenge the use of AI or outcomes of automated decision-making. In a statement, Husic said Australians “know AI can do great things” but they also wanted to know protections are in place “if things go off the rails”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “We need more people to use AI and to do that we need to build trust” by creating a regulatory framework, he said. Long the stuff of science fiction, generative artificial intelligence – which can create new content such as text, images, audio and code – has experienced a surge in uptake through “large language model” programs such as ChatGPT, Google’s chatbot Bard and Microsoft Bing’s chat feature. AI is already throwing up challenges to lawmakers and consumers, from misleading people on prices, alleged defamation from false claims served up by chat programs to warnings from the eSafety commissioner that generative AI could automate child grooming by predators. The paper notes while AI can “improve wellbeing and quality of life” its potential for harms include creating and amplifying bias; physical or psychological injury; breach of privacy; and threatening national security through information manipulation and malicious cyber activity. The paper proposes to define high-risk AI to “intended and foreseeable uses” and the “unforeseeable risks” created by general-purpose AI, which “can be applied in contexts they were not originally designed for”. Under the 10 guardrails, organisations developing or deploying high-risk AI would need to establish risk management processes; test AI and monitor once deployed; enable human control or intervention to achieve meaningful human oversight; inform end-users of AI decisions, interactions and content; and establish processes for people affected by AI systems to challenge use or outcomes. Organisations should also be required to “keep and maintain records to allow third parties to assess compliance with guardrails” and undertake tests to certify their own compliance, it said. Once settled, the guardrails could be applied within existing regulations, through amendments to legislation in separate domains or through “a new cross-economy AI act”, as the EU moved to do in June. That option would enable the creation of an independent AI regulator, although this would “take resources and time”, the paper said. Husic said Australians want stronger protections on AI and businesses had also been calling for greater clarity around using AI safely. “From today, we’re starting to put those protections in place,” he said. The paper noted the government plans to “strengthen privacy protections, transparency and accountability”, a reference to the privacy law reform package expected to be unveiled as early as next week. The attorney general’s department is also working on a “whole of government legal framework to support use of automated decision-making systems”, which was a recommendation from the robodebt royal commission."

                    "bodyText": "When a powerful earthquake struck near Los Angeles last month, it was a neat metaphor for a Hollywood film industry shaken in recent years by a streaming revolution, Covid pandemic, racial reckoning and crippling strikes. And nowhere are the aftershocks felt more keenly than in the writers’ room. These are collaborative spaces where writers come together to brainstorm ideas, debate plot twists, bounce jokes off each other and punch up scripts so they are ready for production. The formula has produced TV greats from The Dick Van Dyke Show to Saturday Night Live, from The Simpsons to The Sopranos. In the era when networks would commission a season of 22 episodes of a sitcom or drama, these rooms would often boast a dozen or more writers (dominated by white men) who would also assist on set if the actors needed guidance during filming – an exposure that many say was invaluable. The rooms were precious training grounds for young writers to cut their teeth and build a network of contacts. But that was then. Today, with the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, studios increasingly rely on so-called mini-rooms with just four or five writers to create shows, often with fewer episodes. “In most cases the writers’ rooms today are very different from 10 or 20 years ago,” says Matthew Belloni, an entertainment lawyer and former editor of the Hollywood Reporter. “Most shows have far fewer episodes. The days of 22-episode network sitcoms and dramas are mostly gone, with exceptions, and consequently the number of writers in a writers’ room is typically much fewer than it was. Now, there are more shows than there were back then but the number of shows is coming down from the peak of three or four years ago.” These factors – and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) – were bones of contention during last year’s writers’ strike, which at 148 days was one of the longest in Hollywood history, compounded by actors downing tools at the same time. The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which did not respond to requests for comment for this article, fought to preserve the writers’ room as an inherently valuable concept. At one point this prompted a retort from the studios: “If writing needs to be done, writers are hired, but these proposals require the employment of writers whether they’re needed for the creative process or not.” The studios proposed that writers’ rooms should have a minimum of just three writers including the showrunner. The union managed to fend this off and reach an agreement that shows intended to run at least 13 episodes will have at least six writers on staff, with numbers shifting based on the number of episodes. Staff on shows in initial development will be employed for at least 10 weeks, while staff on shows that go to air will be employed for three weeks per episode. Anton Schettini, 35, who has worked in 14 TV writers’ rooms and is the author of Breaking into TV Writing, says: “Because streamers have shorter seasons, writers’ rooms last a shorter amount of time. There’s fewer episodes – something like six to 10 – on streamers, whereas networks would do 22 or, in the days of cable, there would be like a 12-episode season. “Your time working in a writers’ room has certainly shortened and we have seen up until the strike the writers’ room getting smaller and smaller, which is why the WGA fought for a minimum in the negotiation, which was implemented.” The three-year contract also secured an increase in pay and future residual earnings of between 3.5% and 5%. That was a boost for those who can get work. But for many writers who endured the strike in the hope that good times were just around the corner, conditions remain brutal. In a May article headlined “The Daily Terror of Being a TV Writer Right Now”, Gideon Yago, whose credits include The Newsroom and The Mosquito Coast, told Vanity Fair: “I just don’t sleep. These last couple of months have been the hardest. I haven’t had a single conversation with anyone in the industry that hasn’t expressed fear and frustration. That’s really, really bad when you’re in the enchantment and entertainment business.” A screenwriter, who has worked on several high-profile shows and wishes to remain anonymous, tells the Guardian that some of his former co-workers are no longer getting hired. “These are people who are not breaking in – they worked on the same shows that I did right before,” he says in a phone interview. “Now they’re saying, ‘We’re not getting any work. Our agents and managers are saying staffing is tricky out there.’ Partly it’s because the strike brought us a lot of benefits – salaries have increased, mini-rooms are much better paid than before – and as a result of that there are fewer of them.” Despite the reduced episode count, writers argue that the workload remains just as arduous and, with shorter employment periods, they must constantly be on the lookout for the next opportunity to earn a living wage in Los Angeles. The current climate is forcing them to make difficult decisions. The writer adds: “There are people I know that have been in the industry for a long time and they used to say, ‘I only work on the east coast, I’m not going to travel to LA,’ or, ‘I prefer Zoom because I’m a full-time single parent.’ But now they’re saying: ‘I need the money so if I have to pack up my kids and family full-time for 20 weeks with potential hiatuses built in, I guess that’s what I have to do’.” Virtual writers’ room sprang up during the pandemic, although there studios are pushing for a full return in person. The screenwriter adds: “Remote work is dwindling a bit. It became very popular during the pandemic. People were used to rooms fully virtual but now things are starting to go back to normal.” The writers’ strike began five months after OpenAI released its AI tool ChatGPT. The new agreement stipulates that scripts must be written by humans, not AI. Studios and production companies are obliged disclose to writers if any material given to them has been generated by AI in full or partly. In addition, AI-generated storylines will not be regarded as “literary material” – a term in their contracts for scripts and other story forms a screenwriter produces – so writers will not have to compete with AI for screen credits. The companies are not barred from using AI to generate content but writers have the right to sue if their work is used to train AI. For now, studios seem content to let writers do the work rather than spending more money on AI. The anonymous screenwriter comments: “Last year AI was the conversation of the moment: ‘Hmm, could we come up with a bit of content or an outline or treatment without hiring writers?’ “But once a room is fully up and running and you have access to all these creatives no one is going to look outside for additional AI content. Most people are like, well, we pay you guys, so come up with this on your own.” He gave the example of fake newspapers or the fake crawls that run across the screen on a cable news channel on a TV in the background of a scene. “That’s something you’d think people would pay to use AI to generate but we write it manually. “In the morning you’re like, let’s write the crawls that are coming on this fake CNN report that’s on the TV in the background. In that sense that’s been encouraging. All writers respect the process enough that it’s not part of the conversation; it’s not something you default to.” Another upheaval for writers’ rooms over the past five years have been the racial reckoning that followed Black Lives Matter protests over the police murder of George Floyd, an African American man, in Minneapolis in 2020. Most studios have diverse writer programmes and some actively mandate that each writers’ room has a diverse element. The unnamed screenwriter, who is Black, comments: “It adds a safety to my career in that there is an element of, if we have an all-male or all-white writer’s room, showrunners will feel the need to add some diversity. It’s crass to say they’ll pick from a pile but they will seek to rectify that. “I do think, though, that role is limited. Some former colleagues say, ‘It’s easier if you’re a person of colour to get hired right now.’ I always bristle against that because there’s only one in my room and it is me. I know other writers of colour who are in rooms of two writers of colour so it feels like a checkbox that, once it is checked, people don’t look beyond that to fulfill that need. “To me it feels like I’m not taking a spot that would go to other people; I’m competing with a lot of people who look like me to fill the only spot and, once that spot is filled, diversity has been ‘met’.” Writers suffered financially even when streaming was booming as studios tried to compete with Netflix and, adopting a Silicon Valley mindset, prioritised subscriber growth and hoped profits would follow. The result was content saturation, with some expensive shows barely watched or even left on the shelf. Studios have been grasping for a sustainable business model and writers now face even greater hardship as they scale down and consolidate. Earlier this month Paramount shut down its television studio as part of a cost-cutting measure to save half a billion dollars. Belloni, the entertainment lawyer who is a founding partner of the website Puck, says: “When Netflix became the dominant streaming service all of the legacy media companies bolted out to try and compete. Now they are pulling back because they spent so much money and their investors are asking for profit, not subscriber growth necessarily.” He concludes: “It’s a very tough time in Hollywood. The pullback in content and the bursting of the TV bubble has led to fewer jobs, more competition and tougher negotiating positions for these writers. All of it means it’s tougher than ever to be a working professional screenwriter.”"

                    "bodyText": "After three years and more than 100 issues, as well as two bouts of paternity leave, two AI summits and an entire cryptocurrency boom-bust cycle, this is my last newsletter. It’s also the end of my 11 years at the Guardian, almost to the week: my first day was the release of the iPhone 5S, and on 9 September we’ll see the launch of the iPhone 16. It’s been a ride. For the last two weeks I’ve been asking readers for questions and have been bombarded. I apologise if I didn’t get round to yours, but thank you so much to everyone who wrote in. What’s been the most shocking thing you’ve discovered in researching/reporting on the TechScape? – Alexandria Weber In 2019, I was sent a leak of TikTok’s internal moderation documents. They revealed, for the first time, that the company had explicit policies, in writing and applied globally, to enforce Chinese foreign policy on its platform. The company, the leak showed, censored videos that mentioned Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong. TikTok insisted the documents were out-of-date, even at the time, and that they had been retired some months earlier and replaced with new, locally sensitive guidelines. As a mark of the direction the company was moving in, that was a good sign. But that leak provides the basis, to this day, of concerns that the company isn’t as separate from the Chinese state as it suggests. Computer scientist Ray Kurzweil says that within 20 years we will have the ability to duplicate a person’s mind in a computer, including all their memories, their personality and consciousness. Do you think this claim is credible? – David Kurzweil’s “singularity” has been 20 years in the future for the last 30, so I’m not sure there’s reason to put much weight on the date he predicts. But the bigger problem for me with his predictions is that, in the last few years, the order of operations has changed somewhat. The old singularitarian view was that computers were getting faster and faster, and eventually they would get fast enough to mimic a brain, at which point uploads would be possible. That’s subtly different from the AI utopian worldview, which is that AI gets more and more capable until the AI cracks the problem of uploading a human brain. In that vision of the future, uploading your brain only even becomes a thing after superintelligent AI is already created and reshaping the world. It seems like an odd thing to focus on! Do you think Facebook and Google have already peaked, and face a slow but inevitable slide into relative insignificance? – Barney Never say never. Companies reinvent themselves all the time – tech, of course, has the greatest example of that with Apple, all but written-off as a leading player in the 1990s before launching its remarkable revival, from the iMac to the iPhone. Both Meta and Google are racing to try to take a lead position in AI, which could see them becoming, again, some of the most significant companies on the planet. But I agree with the premise of the question: there is a shift in excitement and attention in technology, and the existing businesses of Google and Meta are on the downside of that shift. Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Google Search are going to continue printing money for the foreseeable future, but none are at the exciting frontier of the industry any more. Also, of course, when a company is the fourth- or sixth-biggest in the world, it’s hard not to have peaked. There’s only so much more “up” to go. Where do smartphones go from here? How can a new smartphone model really distinguish itself from the crowd? – John Brown The boring but true answer here is that foldable phones are going to steadily come down in price and up in quality until there’s a sudden bloom of creativity in hardware design again. Samsung’s led the way with its two approaches – the clamshell-style Flip seen, heavily, around the Olympics, and the folio-style Fold. The screen technology still isn’t flawless, with a noticeable ridge down the middle of the unfolded phone, and the prices range from high to eye-watering, but the devices are the only truly novel designs to be seen in the industry in the last decade. And then, in a year or two, Apple will launch a foldable and everyone will realise that they exist. The vibes around tech seem to have changed a lot in the past half decade or so – there seems to be much more anxiety about how it will change society for the worse, and not much optimism. Do you think the industry can overcome that? – Ido Vock I think tech now feels like a very similar position to finance 15 years ago. It will continue to attract smart and capable people because the work is interesting and well-paid, but there’s a very clear vibe shift. I don’t think the industry can reverse the clock, but I wonder how much it is necessary to do that. Money solves a lot of ills, and it’s better to be rich than optimistic. The real question, for me, is whether that shift around tech as a sector threatens to spill over into a broader cynicism around the entire idea of science and technology improving the world. I hope not. I remain, fundamentally, optimistic about the progress of humanity, and think some of the forthcoming breakthroughs in fields such as health, green energy, and even spaceflight are going to be exciting. Best game ever (and why is it a Soulsborne)? – Chris M Soulsborne games, for those not in the know, are a genre created by a developer From Software and its auteur director Hidetaka Miyazaki, characterised by punishing difficulty curves, oblique narrative structures and a tone memorably summed up as “fucked-up little guy chuckles at you from behind a locked door”. Personally I have a soft spot for Bloodborne, the 2015 PlayStation 4 entry in the series, but I’m 50 hours in to Elden Ring, the most recent Soulsborne proper, and it’s very good. The best game ever, though, remains the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Six years on from the release of the Switch and its console-defining launch title, it’s still not been topped, even by its impeccable sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. That said, Elden Ring is a great game for adults who are too proud to be seen with an all-ages title but really a little bit of Goth Zelda. Any more of this and I’ll have to co-brand my final newsletter with Pushing Buttons, so let’s end it here. What’s the best example you’ve seen of tech providing a truly valuable positive change to the world in your time in that gig? – Steve Parks In my professional life, the answer is unquestionably machine transcription. It’s not flashy, but being able to generate a flawed real-time transcript of a recording of an interview is genuinely transformative to reporting, speeding up the work of turning an idea into a published news story by hours. More broadly, I think a similar answer is the rise of machine translation. These tools have improved slowly and consistently over the past 20 years to the point that significant sections of humanity can now communicate with each other, basically intelligibly, in near-real-time. One of the most interesting outcomes of which is that, at least in the short term, nothing really has changed. Language proficiency is still valuable, people still largely consume content in their own language or professionally translated, and there has not been an enormous merging of online communities into one enormous global melange. Maybe that will come? Or maybe this science-fiction turned fact technology will continue to be mostly useful for making my holidays smoother and letting me read funny Bluesky posts from Japan. What’s next? – 17 different readers, thank you all After 11 years at the Guardian, I’m not leaping straight into the next thing, and I’ll be taking the next six weeks off. Until then, you can keep in touch with me on some of the weirder social networks like Bluesky or Backloggd; I won’t return to writing a weekly newsletter any time soon, but if you’re interested in an infrequent update on where I’ve published stories, I intend to put the odd roundup on my dormant Substack. I’ve met so many readers of TechScape over the years, and been overjoyed every time. Thank you to everyone who’s read, emailed, or shared a story, and stick around – there are some great writers lined up to take over."

                    "bodyText": "The Pixel 9 Pro is a rare beast: a smaller phone that keeps the same bold design, specs and camera as Google’s biggest and most expensive model. It makes it an instant contender for the best small phone going. At £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699), it is cheaper than its larger Pixel 9 Pro XL sibling but still firmly in the high-end bracket. What sets it apart is the 6.3in screen is significantly tighter than the monster 6.7in-plus sizes you usually need to get the very best hardware. While not exactly tiny, it is small for a modern high-end phone, joining only a handful in the market such as Samsung’s 6.2in Galaxy S24 and the 6.1in iPhone 15 Pro. The screen is bright, fast and crisp, rivalling the best in the business. The bold new camera lump on the back makes the Pixel stand out, while the flat aluminium sides and frosted glass back look and feel expensive. The new Tensor G4 chip, 16GB of RAM and starting storage of 128GB all match the 9 Pro XL and perform similarly. It is snappy in operation and handles apps just fine, but can’t match the raw performance of Android rivals running Qualcomm’s top chips, particularly in games. The Pixel’s battery life is pretty good for a smaller phone. It lasts just over 48 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about seven hours on a mix of 5G and wifi, meaning you have to charge it every other day or so. That’s a few hours short of its larger sibling, but a good 10 hours longer than the iPhone 15 Pro. A full charge takes just over 80 minutes using a 27W or greater USB-C charger (not included). Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G4 RAM: 16GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 14 Camera: 50MP + 48MP ultrawide + 48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm Weight: 199g Android, Gemini and next-gen AI The Pixel ships with Android 14 and seven years of software support, including an upgrade to Android 15 in the autumn, making it one of the longest-lasting phones on the market. The big new additions for the Pixel phones this year are all AI-based, being some of the first handsets to run Google’s latest Gemini Nano AI models on device. Similar to the 9 Pro XL, the new Gemini Live experience is undoubtedly the highlight. It provides a new, fully conversational mode allowing you to speak to Google’s most advanced Gemini assistant with an open mic and have it respond via voice for a flowing, back and forth discussion. It is smart enough to remember the topics and progression of your conversation, can provide useful information and asks its own questions to help move things along. One chat I had with it, we discussed the fastest parkruns in the south-east of London. It asked if I was after a personal best, talked about the surfaces, discussed the average attendance each Saturday, then was able to give me travel times and the weather forecast for each park. The system is not perfect all the time, but the answers were very human, with a touch of personality. It requires a £19 a month Gemini Advanced subscription to use, a year of which is bundled free with any of the Pixel 9 Pro phones. Another useful AI utility is the Screenshots app, which collates your shots and makes them searchable. The Pixel Studio app quickly generates images via text prompts with a range of styles. The Google Photos Magic Editor can automatically reframe an image by either cropping or expanding the canvas using generative AI. The new “reimagine” feature goes one step further and can fully recast a photo or insert objects into it using text prompts. How far you go with it is up to you, but it can produce stunning images, or problematic ones, with very little effort. Camera The camera is the 9 Pro’s crown jewel. It supports the full top Google camera system, including a 48MP ultrawide, 50MP main and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera, which comfortably outzooms similarly sized rivals that are typically limited to 3x. The cameras are all-round excellent, capturing detail-rich images across the board. They excel in more difficult scenes, such as dim lighting or motion. The 5x telephoto camera has an in-sensor zoom feature producing the equivalent of a 10x optical zoom to meaningfully close the distance to objects. The additional digital zoom, up to 30x, is surprisingly good in bright light too. The new Add Me feature helps photographers join group shots by blending two photos taken back to back into one image. The photographer takes the first shot then hands over camera duties to another member of the the group for the second shot. An augmented reality overlay shows where to position yourself to get in the shot. It works well in some scenarios, but requires practice to get right and sometimes trips up on certain objects in the scene. Sustainability Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery, but it should maintain at least 80% of its original capacity after 500 full charge cycles. The phone is repairable by Google and third-party shops, with genuine replacement parts to be available from iFixit soon. The repair specialists awarded the Pixel 9 Pro XL five out of 10 for repairability. The Pixel 9 Pro is made with at least 18% recycled materials, including recycled aluminium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Google will recycle old devices free of charge. Price The Google Pixel 9 Pro costs from £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699). For comparison, the Pixel 8a costs £499, the Pixel 9 costs £799, the Pixel 9 Pro XL costs £1,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,149 and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro costs £999. Verdict The Pixel 9 Pro is one of the very best small phones you can buy. The fabulous 6.3in screen may not be truly small, but the Pixel squeezes all the top-end hardware from Google’s 6.8in superphone into a much smaller and more manageable body. That means you get the full camera system with a 5x optical zoom that rivals at this size simply can’t match. You also get long battery life, decent performance, software support for seven years from release and all the latest cutting-edge AI features you can shake a stick at. A bundled year’s subscription to Gemini Advanced enables the impressive Gemini Live conversational AI assistant, too. It isn’t a bargain at £999, but that sort of price is unfortunately par for the course for a high-end phone, matching Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical zoom, great screen, good battery life, recycled aluminium, impressive local and generative AI features, Gemini Live included for a year. Cons: expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance short of best in class, temperature sensor is still a gimmick outside the US."

                    "bodyText": "Sir Keir Starmer is not the first Labour leader to hanker after a closer relationship between Britain and Germany. Jim Callaghan snuggled up close to the chancellor Helmut Schmidt in the 1970s, and ever since there has been a sense among the social democratic left in the UK that there is much to be learned from Europe’s biggest economy. The Germans, it has been said repeatedly down the decades, have a superior model of capitalism: based on good design and skilled workmanship; stable, long-term funding arrangements between businesses and the banks; a more consensual system of industrial relations; a network of medium-sized companies, many of them family-owned; a top-notch system of vocational and technical training that ensures a steady supply of skilled, productive workers. There is a reason Germans work fewer hours and enjoy higher living standards than the Brits: they have rejected Anglo-Saxon capitalism in favour of something better. They run a whopping trade surplus, have sound public finances and keep inflation under control. What’s not to like? There was a time when that thesis might well have been right on the money. Some of it may still hold true. It is certainly the case that Germany has been able to spend €2tn (£1.7tn) over 30 years levelling up east Germany – a sustained commitment that puts the UK’s effort in the shade. The brutal truth, though, is that Germany is no longer an appropriate role model for the UK (or indeed, any other country). It is a country where the threat to democracy posed by extremist parties is the result of economic failure. If Britain thinks it has a problem with the far right, then Germany’s problems are of a different order of magnitude. The anti-immigrant party AfD has been leading in the polls before this weekend’s state elections in Saxony and Thuringia. History is in danger of repeating itself. It is not just that Germany’s recent performance has been poor, although that has certainly been the case. Since 2018, Germany has been the slowest-growing economy in the G7 – expanding by 0.4% a year on average. While the rest of the eurozone’s big four – France, Italy and Spain – have been showing signs of recovering from the slowdown caused by the Ukraine war-induced energy shock, Germany has continued to struggle and is still flirting with technical recession. To be sure, there are reasons for that. Germany was particularly exposed to the higher cost of gas on global markets triggered by Russia’s invasion in 2022, not least because of its high concentration of energy-intensive industries. If this were simply the case of a particularly severe cyclical downturn, then there would be little to worry about. Germany has come through plenty of tricky situations in the past, and in the past those who have written it off have been proved wrong. This time, however, the reasons for Germany’s economic woes go deeper. There are structural causes, the main one being a determination to cling on to the model that has brought it such success but is now past its sell-by date. Technological change happens in long cycles usually lasting decades. The first wave involved the harnessing of steam power to run the factories that grew up in Britain in the late 18th and 19th centuries. These technologies were eventually superseded by electricity, the internal combustion engine and consumer electronics. These, in turn, are being challenged by the new growth sectors – smartphones, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI). An analogue world is rapidly going digital, and Germany has been painfully slow to realise that. In a sense, that’s inevitable. Britain was the dominant economic power in the 19th century on the back of the technologies of the first Industrial Revolution and found it hard to break with the old ways even when it should have been obvious that its coal and textile industries were in long-term decline. As a result, Britain lagged behind its competitors. One of these was Germany, which excelled in advanced manufacturing and precision engineering. Companies such as Volkswagen and BMW made big profits in the golden age of the petrol and diesel-fuelled car. In a sense, Germany became the victim of its own success. It saw no reason to change the model and invested too little in physical, human and digital infrastructure. There are many fascinating facts in Wolfgang Münchau’s compelling new book about the end of the German economic miracle – Kaput – due out this autumn. One is that the UK now has a larger proportion of students studying a Stem subject – science, technology, engineering and maths – than Germany. Another is that Germany is nowhere when it comes to exploiting the possibilities of AI. The US and the UK have 5.22 AI startups for each 100,000 inhabitants; Germany has 1.9. Nor has Germany lived up to its reputation for long-termism when it comes to the transition to electric vehicles. On the contrary, the big car companies were woefully shortsighted when meeting the existential threat posed by low-cost Chinese models. The US is the prime example of a country that has moved with the times and has been able to adapt its industrial structure to changing circumstances. As Münchau puts it: “The German super-cycle is ending; that of the US is still going strong.” So, yes, the UK under-invests and needs to find a way of being at the cutting edge of the fourth Industrial Revolution. But so, too, does Germany, a country long overdue the creative destruction that would allow new ideas and new products to flourish. And, yes, Britain has lessons to learn from other countries. Yet not many of them will come from Germany, increasingly an analogue economy in a digital world."

                    "headline": "Nvidia shares fall on slowing growth and production concerns",
                    "bodyText": "Shares in the chip designer Nvidia have fallen after investors were spooked by signs of slowing growth and production issues, despite the artificial intelligence company posting a 122% rise in second-quarter revenues compared with the same period last year. The Silicon Valley company’s revenues for the period more than doubled to $30bn (£23bn), beating average analyst estimates of $28.7bn. However, investors were concerned about signs of a slowdown in growth, in particular around its next-generation AI chips, codenamed Blackwell. The stock fell as much as 7% in pre-market trading, before paring back losses to a 3.4% fall as of midday trading on New York’s Nasdaq. The chipmaker is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market value of $3.1tn. The sudden drop in its share price wiped more than $100bn (£76bn) from its stock market value. Nvidia’s partial recovery after its early morning decline appeared to buoy other tech stocks and chipmakers during Thursday trading. Google, Apple and Amazon, as well as the chip designer Arm holdings, all saw their stock prices rise as of midday. Nvidia said the delivery of its Blackwell chips – which comprise 208bn transistors that carry out calculations to train its large language model – would be delayed by several months from January. Its chief executive, Jensen Huang, has previously said that Blackwell would generate “a lot of revenue” for the business this year. Simon French, the chief economist and head of research at the investment bank Panmure Liberum told the BBC: “There were just some signs around the edges in numbers that that rate of growth was trying to slow. Their current AI chip ‘hopper’ is selling well, but the next one, the next generation Blackwell, has faced some production delays, and that perhaps is one of the reasons why Wall Street, after hours, sold off the stock.” Nvidia bosses did not detail the extent of the delay for Blackwell deliveries but said manufacturing issues had been addressed by TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor firm that builds the US company’s most advanced chips. They added that early samples were now shipping to a small group of customers. The drop in Nvidia’s share price dragged on US markets, in particular the S&amp;P 500 index. Nvidia makes up about 6% of the total value of the index and has helped drive its gains this year, after rising more than 160% over the past 12 months. Matt Britzman, an analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said Nvidia was facing the challenge of how to match the hype. “It’s less about just beating estimates now, markets expect them to be shattered and it’s the scale of the beat that looks to have disappointed a touch.” While many investors have bought into the theoretical impact of artificial intelligence and claims that it could transform nearly every global industry, French noted that the practical use cases “haven’t yet been proven”. “Such are the lofty expectations for this stock, not just as a single company, but its broader economic impact. If you’re going to raise expectations that high, then you’ve got to keep growing at spectacular rates,” he said. However, Britzman cautioned against reading too much into the market reaction, given that investors tended to “overstate” the importance of one set of quarterly results, particularly in the “grand scheme of AI” prospects. Instead, he said companies such as Microsoft, Tesla and the Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta, were working on a “multi-year, even multi-decade, time frame and investors would be wise to adopt a similar mentality”. He added: “The question of return on investment, that many AI bears [sceptics] fall back on, simply isn’t the main consideration for Nvidia’s biggest customers at this stage. Like many before, this cycle won’t be a straight line, but while the ‘build it and they will come’ approach continues, it plays right into Nvidia’s hands.”"

                    "headline": "California advances landmark legislation to regulate large AI models",
                    "bodyText": "A California bill that would establish first-in-the-nation safety measures for the largest artificial intelligence systems cleared an important vote Wednesday. The proposal, aiming to reduce potential risks created by AI, would require companies to test their models and publicly disclose their safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for example, wipe out the state’s electric grid or help build chemical weapons – scenarios experts say could be possible in the future with such rapid advancements in the industry. The measure squeaked by in the state assembly Wednesday and won procedural approval in the state senate. It now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature, though he has not indicated his position on it. Governor Gavin Newsom has until the end of September to decide whether to sign it into law, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. He declined to weigh in on the measure earlier this summer but had warned against AI overregulation. Supporters said it would set some of the first much-needed safety ground rules for large-scale AI models in the United States. The bill targets systems that require more than $100m in data to train. No current AI models have hit that threshold. The proposal, authored by Democratic senator Scott Wiener, faced fierce opposition from venture capital firms and tech companies, including OpenAI, Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. They say safety regulations should be established by the federal government and that the California legislation takes aim at developers instead of targeting those who use and exploit the AI systems for harm. Wiener said his legislation took a “light touch” approach. “Innovation and safety can go hand in hand – and California is leading the way,” he said in a statement after the vote. Wiener’s proposal is among dozens of AI bills California lawmakers proposed this year to build public trust, fight algorithmic discrimination and outlaw deepfakes that involve elections or pornography. With AI increasingly affecting the daily lives of Americans, state legislators have tried to strike a balance of reigning in the technology and its potential risks without stifling the booming homegrown industry. California, home of 35 of the world’s top 50 AI companies, has been an early adopter of AI technologies and could soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion and road safety, among other things. Elon Musk, owner of Twitter/X, and founder of xAI, threw his support behind the proposal this week, though he said it was a “tough call”. X operates its own chatbot and image generator, Grok, that has fewer safeguards in place than other prominent AI models. “For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public,” Musk tweeted. A group of several California house members also opposed the bill, with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it “well-intentioned but ill informed”. Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning Silicon Valley-funded industry group, said the bill is “based on science fiction fantasies of what AI could look like”. “This bill has more in common with Blade Runner or The Terminator than the real world,” senior tech policy director Todd O’Boyle said in a statement after the Wednesday vote. “We shouldn’t hamstring California’s leading economic sector over a theoretical scenario.” The legislation is also supported by Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Amazon and Google, after Wiener adjusted the bill earlier this month to include some of the company’s suggestions. The current bill removed a penalty of perjury provision, limited the state attorney general’s power to sue violators and narrowed the responsibilities of a new AI regulatory agency. Anthropic said in a letter to Newsom that the bill is crucial to prevent catastrophic misuse of powerful AI systems and that “its benefits likely outweigh its costs”. He also slammed critics earlier this week for dismissing potential catastrophic risks from powerful AI models as unrealistic: “If they really think the risks are fake, then the bill should present no issue whatsoever.”"

                    "bodyText": "Cate Blanchett – beloved thespian, film star and refugee advocate – is standing at a lectern addressing the European Union parliament. “The future is now,” she says, authoritatively. So far, so normal, until: “But where the fuck are the sex robots?” The footage is from a 2023 address that Blanchett actually gave – but the rest has been made up. Her voice was generated by Australian artist Xanthe Dobbie using the text-to-speech platform PlayHT for Dobbie’s 2024 video work Future Sex/Love Sounds – an imagining of a sex robot-induced feminist utopia, voiced by celebrity clones. Much has been written about the world-changing potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), including Midjourney and Open AI’s GPT-4, which are trained on vast swathes of data to create everything from academic essays, fake news and “revenge porn” to music, images and software code. Proponents praise the technology for speeding up scientific research and eliminating mundane admin, while on the other side, a broad range of workers – from accountants, lawyers and teachers to graphic designers, actors, writers and musicians – are facing an existential crisis. As the debate rages on, artists such as Dobbie are turning to those very same tools to explore the possibilities and precarities of the technology itself. “There’s all of this ethical grey area because the legal systems are not able to catch up with anywhere near the same speed at which we’re proliferating the technology itself,” says Dobbie, whose work draws on celebrity internet culture to interrogate technology and power. “We see these celebrity replicas happening all the time, but our own data – us, the small people of the world – is being harvested at exactly the same rate … It’s not really the capacity of the technology [that’s bad], it’s the way flawed, dumb, evil people choose to wield it.” Choreographer Alisdair Macindoe is another artist working at the nexus of technology and art. His new work Plagiary, opening this week as part of Melbourne’s Now or Never festival followed by a season at Sydney Opera House, uses custom algorithms to generate new choreography performed by dancers receiving it for the first time each night. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning While the AI-generated instructions are specific, each dancer can interpret them in their own way – making the resulting performance more of a collaboration between man and machine. “Often the questions [from dancers] early on will be like: ‘I’ve been told to swivel my left elbow repeatedly, to go to the back corner, imagine I’m a cow that’s just been born. Am I still swivelling my left elbow at that point?’” says Macindoe. “It quite quickly becomes this really interesting discussion about meaning, interpretation and what is truth.” Not all artists are fans of the technology. In January 2023, Nick Cave posted an eviscerating review of a song generated by ChatGPT that mimicked his own work, calling it “bullshit” and “a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human”. “Songs arise out of suffering,” he said, “by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel.” Painter Sam Leach disagrees with Cave’s idea that “creative genius” is exclusive to humans, but he encounters this kind of “blanket rejection of the technology and anything to do with” often. “I’ve never really been particularly interested in anything related to the purity of the soul. I really view my practice as a way of researching and understanding the world that’s around me … I just don’t see that we can construct a boundary between ourselves and the rest of the world that allows us to define ‘me as a unique individual’.” Leach sees AI as a valuable artistic tool, enabling him to grapple with and interpret a vast gamut of creative output. He has customised an array of open source models that he has trained on his own paintings, as well as reference photographs and historical artwork, to produce dozens of compositions, a select few of which he turns into surreal oil paintings – such as his portrait of a polar bear standing over a bunch of chrome bananas. He justifies his use of sources by highlighting the hours of “editing” he does with his paint brush, to refine his software’s suggestions. He even has art critic chatbots to interrogate his ideas. For Leach, the biggest concern around AI is not the technology itself or how it’s used – but who owns it: “We’ve got this very, very small handful of mega companies that own the biggest models, that have incredible power.” One of the most common concerns around AI involves copyright – a particularly complicated issue for those working in the arts, whose intellectual property is used to train multimillion-dollar models, often without consent or compensation. Last year, for example, it was revealed that 18,000 Australian titles had been used by the Book3 dataset without permission or remuneration in what Booker prize-winning novelist Richard Flanagan described as “the biggest act of copyright theft in history”. And last week Australian music rights management organisation Apra Amcos released survey results that found 82% of its members were concerned AI could reduce their capacity to make a living through music. In the European Union, the Artificial Intelligence Act came into force on 1 August to mitigate these sorts of risks. In Australia, however, while eight voluntary AI ethics principles have existed since 2019, there are still no specific laws or statutes regulating AI technologies. This legislatorial void is pushing some artists to create their own custom frameworks – and models – in order to protect their work and culture. Sound artist Rowan Savage, a Kombumerri man who performs as salllvage, co-developed the AI model Koup Music with the musician Alexis Weaver, as a tool to transform his voice into digital representations of the field recordings he makes on Country, a process he will be presenting at Now or Never festival. Savage’s abstract dance music sounds like dense flocks of electronic birdlife – animal-code hybrid life forms that are haunting and foreign, yet simultaneously familiar. “Sometimes when people think of Aboriginal people in Australia, they think of us as associated with the natural world … there’s something kind of infantilising about that, that we can use technology to speak back to,” says Savage. “We often think there’s this rigid divide between what we call natural and what we call technological. I don’t believe in that. I want to break it down and allow the natural world to infect the technological world.” Savage designed Koup Music to give him full control over which data it is trained on, to avoid appropriating the work of other artists without their consent. In turn, the model protects Savage’s recordings from being fed into the larger networks Koup is built on – recordings he considers the property of his community. “I think it’s fine for me personally to use the recordings that I make of my Country, but I wouldn’t necessarily put them out into the world [for any person or thing to use],” says Savage. “[I wouldn’t feel comfortable] without talking to important people in my community. As Aboriginal people, we’re always community minded, there’s not individual ownership of sources in the same way that the Anglo world might think about it.” For Savage, AI offers great creative potential – but also “quite a lot of dangers”. “My concern as an artist is: how do we use AI in ways that are ethical but also really allow us to do different and exciting things?” Now or Never Melbourne runs until 31 August. An earlier work by Xanthe Dobbie, The Long Now (2022) is available to view at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image website. Alisdair Macoindoe’s Plagiary runs from until 30 August at Now or Never in Melbourne and 12 to 14 September at Unwrapped Sydney. Sam Leach is now creating new work in conjunction with the National Museum of Australia."

The annualised rate of growth for the second quarter, at 3% rather than the 2.8% seen in the first reading, does not suggest an economy that is on the brink of recession. Share prices on Wall Street duly rose, with the S&amp;P 500 rising by 0.5%. That helped Wall Street stock market indices to weather the turbulence that had been expected last night and earlier this morning when Nvidia shares fell in pre-market trading. The chip designer’s shares were down by 2% in early trading on New York’s Nasdaq, but that is quite a bit different from the 7% move in pre-market trading in the hours after it unveiled – don’t forget – a doubling in sales and strong profits. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, a wealth manager, said: The faster-than-expected growth in the second quarter should give a bit more comfort that the US economy remains in decent shape. This revision could also provide a slight boost to the Harris presidential ticket, given that the economy has been a key area of focus for both campaigns. Today’s economic data may also draw some attention away from the intense focus on Nvidia’s results.

JJ Wall Street stock market indices have indeed risen at the opening bell, despite Nvidia shares dipping by 1%. Here are the opening shaps from Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 15.06 POINTS, OR 0.27%, AT 5,607.24 NASDAQ UP 50.33 POINTS, OR 0.29%, AT 17,606.36 DOW JONES UP 281.43 POINTS, OR 0.68%, AT 41,372.85 Wall Street stock indices should be expected to rise at the opening bell in a few minutes according to futures, after stronger-than-expected GDP figures suggested the US economy is growing steadily. The S&amp;P 500 is due to rise 0.3%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is due to rise 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average is set to gain 0.6%. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander US, a bank, said: The bump stemmed from a sharp upward adjustment to real consumer spending growth, from 2.2% to 2.9%, partially offset by smaller downward revisions to business investment, housing, and government spending. We have some economists declaring that the US economy is in or on the cusp of a recession. In my view, we are far from an economic downturn, though I do anticipate that the economy will slow considerably late this year and early next year. My early outlook for the third quarter is that we will enjoy one last solid quarter, driven mainly by the consumer (again). The US economy grew faster than previously thought in the second quarter, according to new GDP figures. The world’s largest economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3% in the second quarter, faster than the 2.8% initially thought, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. More detail to come. German inflation fell by more than expected in August, in a shift that could give the European Central Bank (ECB) cover to start cutting interest rates. Inflation dropped from 2.6% in July to 2% in August, according to the harmonised index of consumer prices reported by Germany’s federal statistics office. That was faster than the 2.3% expected by economists polled by Reuters. It was the slowest rate of inflation in the EU’s largest economy since March 2021. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, and Germany’s wavering economy has dented growth across the bloc. So if inflation falls below target then there would be little reason for the ECB led by Christine Lagarde to hold back on rate cuts that would support the economy. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, an investment bank, said: If confirmed by tomorrow’s eurozone inflation data, today’s German data should make the decision to cut interest rates at the September meeting a bit easier for the ECB. Fading inflationary pressure combined with fading growth momentum offer an almost perfect macro backdrop for another rate cut. At the same time, however, forward-looking inflation indicators like selling-price expectations and wage growth show that there are still reasons to be cautious. In fact, let’s not forget that for central banks, orchestrating a soft landing with inflation nicely settling at target without hurting the economy is like winning a gold medal at the Olympics: rare. Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said: As the Spanish month-on-month reading released earlier was in line with our forecast, a month-on-month reading for the eurozone as a whole at 0.0% month-on-month is a decent bet, consistent with a drop in the eurozone headline to the ECB’s target, 2.0%, from 2.6% in July. A lot depends on the HICP data in France and Italy released tomorrow ahead of the eurozone report. We have pencilled in +0.5% month-on-month and -0.1% month-on-month, respectively, though if today’s numbers are anything to go on, the risks are to the downside. Europe’s brandy makers will be raising a toast today, after China’s commerce ministry said that it would not raise tariffs on the products – for now. The share prices of booze makers Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard rose by 4.5% and 2.9% respectively on Thursday. Reuters reported: China’s commerce ministry said in a statement it had found that European distillers had been selling brandy in its 1.4 billion-strong consumer market at a margin in the range of 30.6% to 39% and that its domestic industry had been damaged. “Provisional anti-dumping measures will not be taken in this case for the time being,” the statement said, leaving open the possibility Beijing may act at some time in the future. Holding the threat of tariffs over EU countries could prove useful in China’s efforts to prevent tariffs on its electric cars. Chinese carmakers are due to pay 21.3% on average if cooperated with an EU investigation and 36.3% on average if they did not. While the measure has already been announced, China may be hoping to persuade EU politicians to weaken it. The US and Canada have also imposed steep tariffs on Chinese cars. Not to cover every little move in relatively thin trading before the market, but Nvidia’s share price is back down by 4% with 90 minutes to go until the Wall Street opening bell. The percentage fluctuations may be small, but with a company that has rapidly grown to be this large – on the back of a historic cycle of hype for artificial intelligence – even small moves are worth billions of dollars. Nvidia’s shares were worth $3.09tn before it published its latest results last night, up a mere 687% over the last two years, according to data company Refinitiv. A 4% drop would equate to a $123bn fall in the notional value of its shares. That is a truly enormous number. For context, Refinitiv only lists 126 companies with a market capitalisation of more than $120bn. Only two other companies are valued more than $3tn: Apple, the world’s biggest at $3.5tn, and Microsoft, valued just below Nvidia (at least ahead of the market open in New York). $120bn gets you a lot. You could buy Boeing ($105bn), the world’s second largest planemaker. Or you could have UBS, the Swiss private banking giant ($107bn – sticking to dollars for ease). In the UK your money would get you the oil supermajor BP ($70bn). Or you could buy most of the British defence industry by swallowing up BAE Systems ($40bn) and Rolls-Royce ($42bn) as a pair. Back in the world of computer chips, Bloomberg News has an interesting story on another of the companies that is key to the global industry. The Netherlands plans to limit the ability of chip toolmaker ASML to repair and maintain semiconductor machinery in China, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources. ASML makes the advanced lithography machines that are used to draw transistors onto semiconducting material at the nanometre scale. It is the only company capable of making equipment to manufacture of the world’s most advanced chips, including those with four-nanometre transistors made by Taiwan’s TSMC for Nvidia. The reliance on ASML has made it a crucial player in the race for dominance of the most advanced chip technologies between China and allies of the US, including Taiwan. Delays or even inability to repair ASML machines could prove a setback for Chinese chipmakers. Bloomberg reported: “The government of prime minister Dick Schoof will likely not renew certain ASML licenses to service and provide spare parts in China when they expire at the end of this year.” A decision to limit the licences would likely further spur China’s efforts to build its own chip industry, after exports to China of certain ASML products were barred earlier this year. Chinese tech champion Huawei has been at the centre of those efforts. Sainsbury’s has said it will create 1,000 new UK jobs after reaching a deal to buy 10 Homebase stores to convert them to supermarkets. The total investment, including buying the leases and spending on fitting them out, will be £130m, Sainsbury’s said in a statement to the stock market. The first of the Homebase stores will reopen as supermarkets next summer, with all of them to be completed by the end of next year. Homebase – once actually part of Sainsbury’s – has been owned by private equity fund Hilco Capital since 2018, when it paid £1 for the retailer as it went through an agreement with creditors that resulted in 1,500 job losses. Sky News last month reported that Hilco was considering a sale to The Range, a Devon-based homeware chain that bought out the remains of the Wilko brand. Simon Roberts, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said: Sainsbury’s food business continues to go from strength to strength as we push ahead with our Next Level Sainsbury’s plan. We have the best combination of value and quality in the market and that’s winning us customers from all our key competitors and driving consistent growth in volume market share. We want to build on this momentum which is why we are growing our supermarket footprint. Our ambition is to be customers’ first choice for food and these new stores will showcase some of the best that Sainsbury’s supermarkets have to offer to even more communities around the country. Nvidia shares were down by 7% early this morning in trading before Wall Street stock markets open, but they have recovered somewhat. Now they are down by only 1.9%. Analysts have had time to digest the results, and some are emphasising the message that the chip designer’s performance was still very impressive – even if it did not blow past the most optimistic estimates as it has done in the past. Blayne Curtis and Ezra Weener, analysts at Jefferies, a US investment bank, have upgraded their price target after the results. They said they were happy with indications that delays to the new Blackwell chip are sorted, and the current Hopper model is still selling well. Hopper demand remains strong and the company noted the Blackwell ramp was a key topic of discussion with expectations of several billion in revenue starting in 4Q – on time despite fears of more significant delays. The delay was fairly well understood already but the company did note a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Overall, AI spend levels won’t be without a debate but the story is back on track with the Blackwell delay fears now in the rearview and several billion dollars of Blackwell layering onto continued growth in Hopper in the back half. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, a fund manager, said: Whilst there is no question that the appetite for the company’s product range remains strong, ahead of the delayed shipments of the latest chip design in Q4, expectations will change little following this release, likely taking a little hot air out of the stock as a result. However, with earnings set to more than double in this fiscal year and the valuation not excessive in light of this growth, there is something for both the stock bulls and the bears to sink their teeth into. The UK will officially enter a new trading bloc on 15 December, after ratification by Peru completed the requirements to join. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) will eventually give British exporters tariff-free access to 11 countries, although it will only apply at first to the six who have ratified it: Japan, Singapore, Chile, New Zealand, Vietnam and now Peru. The UK’s business department on Thursday said that “the agreement could boost the UK economy by around £2bn annually” – albeit by 2040. It was seen as a key trade achievement by the previous Conservative government. But don’t think of it as an economic game-changer to make up for the dent to trade with the EU after Brexit. The Observer’s political editor, Toby Helm, on Sunday reported: Last year, as the Tories presented entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a cornerstone of post-Brexit “global Britain”, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would add just 0.04% to GDP in the “long run”, which it defined as 15 years of membership. The spending watchdog also said that two separate bilateral deals between Britain and Australia and New Zealand, also hailed as landmark trade agreements following Brexit, “might increase the level of real GDP by a combined 0.1% by 2035”. Douglas Alexander, the minister of state for trade policy, said businesses should contact the government to ask about possible benefits. He said: This is good news for UK businesses, who are now one step closer to being able to take advantage of the opportunities our membership of CPTPP will bring. We’re extremely grateful to all the CPTPP partners that have already ratified our accession - Japan, Singapore, Chile, New Zealand, Vietnam and now Peru - and look forward to more doing so over the coming months. The eurozone economy is on track to improve, according to a measure of economic sentiment from the European Commission. The economic sentiment indicator, based on responses from businesses and households, rose from 95.8 points in July to 96.9 in August. That was higher than the flat reading expected by economists. However, the indicator remains below its long-term average – hardly surprising when the largest economy, Germany, is still struggling markedly. The Commission’s measure of consumer confidence fell slightly, to -13.5 points. That was down from -13.4 points the month before. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the hype around artificial intelligence, on the basis that it is the main “picks and shovels” play: rather than trying to take part in the gold rush yourself, be the person who owns the tools for the rush. But another measure of whether that hype can be maintained will be the latest fundraising by OpenAI. It was the company that kicked off the investment frenzy when it released ChatGPT in late 2022, a chatbot that can speak and provide answers in a way that seems on a level with humans (albeit with the same human bluster and fallibility). The company, run by Sam Altman, has already achieved a valuation of $86bn, but it is reportedly seeking investment that will put it above the $100bn mark, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported. The FT said: The San Francisco-based company is talking to venture capital firms including Thrive Capital, which is set to invest $1bn and lead the round, as well as other investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. According to one investor in the company, OpenAI stock has recently traded on the secondary market at a price that implies a valuation of more than $110bn. That investment would be good news for Nvidia, as much of that money will probably go directly to it to buy graphical processing units (GPUs), the specialised chips designed for computer gaming that turned out to be ideal for training AI systems. Altman’s most recent post on X (from three weeks ago) was very complimentary about Thrive’s boss, Josh Kushner. But then again it’s probably worth being nice when a billion dollars is reportedly on the table… European big company share prices have risen to their highest level in six weeks, even if they have hardly been set alight. The Euro Stoxx 600 index gained 0.4% to reach its highest since 15 July. Since then shares have plunged in that early August slump, and then more than recovered. European tech stocks have risen by 0.8% on Thursday morning. Reuters reported: European semis are taking Nvidia’s results in their stride, with STMicro, ASML and ASM International up between 0.7%-1.3%. The power generator Drax has agreed to pay £25m after the energy industry regulator found submitted inaccurate sustainability data on the sourcing of wood pellets used as its massive plant in North Yorkshire. The investigation by Ofgem, which was launched last year, concluded that there was “an absence of adequate data governance and controls in place” on the sourcing of wood from Canada between April 2021 the end of March 2022. Drax, which is the recipient of significant UK government subsidies, has faced continued scrutiny over the sustainability of its wood-burning power generation business. Around 80% of the wood pellets used in Drax’s biomass plants are sourced from forests in the US and Canada. Ofgem said there was no evidence to suggest that that the breach was deliberate, saying instead that it was “technical in nature”. The regulator also said the data ultimately fell outside of the criteria used to determine the amount of public funding that Drax receives and would not impact its government subsidies. At least 70% of biomass has to come from sustainable sources in order for companies to receive government funding. Drax has agreed to pay £25m towards a voluntary redress scheme to settle the matter, and resubmit its profiling data for Canadian-sourced wood pellets. It will also hire an independent auditor to produce data for its annual biomass report for the year to March. However, Ofgem’s findings are likely to fuel further criticism around government support for Drax’s and its biomass operations, which have increasingly come under scrutiny from MPs and environmental campaigners. HSBC’s new boss Georges Elhedery will not start his new job officially until Monday, but it looks like the customary reshuffle at the top under a new chief executive is already underway. Elhedery, who is still technically the UK-listed bank’s chief financial officer until then, is replacing Noel Quinn, who in April made the unexpected announcement that he was stepping down after an “intense” five years in charge. Here is what we have learned today about the jostling behind the scenes (via a statement from the bank reported Reuters). The resignation of Nuno Matos in particular is interesting: he was seen as a potential candidate to take the top chief executive job. Out: HSBC chief executive of wealth and personal banking Nuno Matos will resign. John Hinshaw, HSBC group chief operating officer, has also decided to leave the group to pursue other opportunities. In: Stuart Riley is appointed to the expanded HSBC global chief information officer role, which will assume responsibility for data and innovation. Suzy White, HSBC global banking and markets chief operating officer, has been appointed global chief operating officer on an interim basis. European stock markets are basically unmoved this morning, despite the money on the move in the US after Nvidia’s results. A reminder that we are still just about in August, when much of the investment world takes a holiday. Of course, that can lead to dramatic volatility as we saw this month. Today we appear to have the opposite though. In a rare occurrence, none of the major stock market indices have stirred. Here are the opening snaps from Reuters: EUROPE’S STOXX 600 FLAT BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 FLAT; GERMANY’S DAX FLAT FRANCE’S CAC 40 FLAT; SPAIN’S IBEX FLAT EURO STOXX INDEX FLAT; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS FLAT Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Nvidia shares are down 7% in after-hours trading despite actually beating analyst expectations for sales and profits. The Silicon Valley chip designer reported sales more than doubling to $30bn (£23bn), up 122% in the second quarter compared with last year. Analysts had expected sales of $28.7bn on average. Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive of Nvidia, said anticipation for its forthcoming Blackwell chips – which squeeze in 208bn transistors to carry out the calculations needed to train large language model – was “incredible”, and demand for its current range remained strong. He said: Nvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.” So how come shares fell after US trading hours when the company gave every signal that it believes it is still riding the crest of the artificial intelligence (AI) wave? One might have been the lack of detail on delays that hit Blackwell chip production – although the company suggested those manufacturing issues had been sorted by TSMC, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer that builds Nvidia’s most advanced chips. But another may be that the company’s growth has been so enormous that it needs to not just beat expectations to rise further, but smash them. Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said: Although the results slightly beat expectations, their share price was down around -7% in after-hours trading, partly because it fell short of some estimates that had been looking for an even stronger release. For instance, the revenue outperformance was the smallest relative to expectations in six quarters, so this wasn’t the sort of massive beat that Nvidia has often reported over the last 18 months. At the same time, the Q3 revenue guidance came in a touch above the average estimate ($32.5bn vs $31.9bn est.) but still well within the range of analysts’ views. UK car production slips as carmakers prepare for new models Back in the UK, car manufacturing numbers are down, but only as companies switch production to new models, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The lobby group said that production dropped 14.4% in July “as model changeovers and temporary supply chain constraints restrict output”. One of those new models is likely to be the electric Range Rover, the first electric car to be built in Britain by Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest manufacturer. Its only other electric model, the Jaguar I-Pace, is built by a contract manufacturer in Austria. The industry produced 482,000 cars in the first seven months of the year, down 9% from 2023. The SMMT is hoping that annual production will rise above 1m cars next year as new models start production. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said Following significant growth last year, some readjustment in output was to be expected. Indeed, an ongoing degree of volatility is likely as the industry restructures to transition to zero emission vehicle production. As the billions already committed to new models start to deliver a return, volume growth will resume, providing we seize every opportunity to enhance our global competitiveness.

                    "bodyText": "Medal hopefuls from 168 delegations paraded through Paris for the French capital’s first Paralympic Games opening ceremony. Tens of thousands of spectators surrounded the host city’s largest public square, Place de la Concorde, to witness the launch while an estimated 300 million across the globe tuned in on television. British prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron were among the audience. Five French athletes – Charles-Antoine Kouakou, Fabien Lamirault, Elodie Lorandi, Alexis Hanquinquant and Nantenin Keïta – had the honour of lighting the Paralympic cauldron. Andrew Parsons, president of the International Paralympic Committee, told the ceremony: “At a time of growing conflict and exclusion, let sport bring us together. “Let sport serve as a powerful force for good. Eleven days of sensational sport to enjoy together. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to champion your country’s rich diversity and celebrate the best of Paris, France and humanity. Let us open our minds wide.” He says the Place de la Concorde was central to the French revolution and tonight stages the start of another revolution. “Liberté, égalité, fraternité!” The 17th Paralympic Games began under blue skies then lit up the night as Paris made a powerful start in extending to disability sport the same energy and joy that has so far characterised its historic summer. In the coming 11 days there will be new heroes made, new stories told and, just perhaps, the possibility of a legacy of positive change for people with disability. But in front of a crowd of 35,000 spectators at the Place de la Concorde, a ceremony threaded together by bold, expressive dance and featuring a parade of 128 often jubilant competing nations created a party atmosphere, and an image of a country still “en fete”. As the head of the International Paralympic Committee, Andrew Parsons called for a “revolution of inclusion” in his speech and the president of Paris 2024, Tony Estanguet, praised the fans, “la public complètement fou”, there was space left for the French president Emmanuel Macron only to perform the briefest of ceremonial functions, declaring the Games open, as the energy of night swarmed elsewhere. Unlike the Olympic opening ceremony there were no shots of sodden performers to spoil the party. Temperatures of 30C and cloudless skies meant that everything passed without disruption and the tribunes were full. By the time the French delegation arrived in the arena past 10pm to the sounds of Champs-Élysées and various other pieces of chanson that remain in the collective memory, the spirit of the summer of 2024 was once again in full effect. Involving 500 performers, including dancers, pop stars, furry revolutionary hats and the ubiquitous DJ, the title of the ceremony was Paradox, the theme a journey from Discord to Concord. As with every aspect of Paris 2024 this was an idea pinned to the geography and history of the French capital. Here is the lowdown on the events we can look forward to on Thursday: The journalist Gareth A Davies believes tonight was the best Paralympics opening ceremony. Right, that’s it from me, but Nadeem is taking over the baton and will bring you any more reaction, while we’ll have a report from our man in Paris, Paul MacInnes, shortly. And do also join us tomorrow, when we’ll have live coverage of the sporting action. Thanks for your company and messages this evening. A demain! Fireworks bring the show to an end. Many on social media are saying this is the best ever Paralympics opening ceremony. The pure Parisian cheer and glee of the Olympics opening ceremony was replaced here by something much more considered, powerful and atmospheric. It wasn’t only beautiful and enchanting but delivered such an important message about disability, diversity and inclusivity. And Paris, once again, provided the perfect backdrop. “As good as London 2012” says Rob Walker on Channel 4. I think it may just have been better. The balloon over the cauldron seems other wordly, it almost looks like a giant gold moon, with the Eiffel Tower still sparkling in the background. This is so visually striking. And five French athletes – Charles-Antoine Kouakou, Fabien Lamirault, Elodie Lorandi, Alexis Hanquinquant and Nantenin Keïta – have the honour of lighting the cauldron. They present their flames to the cauldron at the same time, and in the words of the French, la fête continue! Seventeen days after the Olympics ended, the sporting party is back on! To mark the moment, Christine and the Queens is back to sing Born to be Alive and the Paralympics is officially under way. And we got through the whole ceremony without seeing Snoop Dogg once. The Paralympians involved in the torch ceremony include Bebe Vio, the Italian star fencer whose face I’ve seen on many billboards on the London Underground over the past couple of months, the American multisport athlete Oksana Masters and the German long jumper Markus Rehm. The flame has now left the Place de la Concorde, as it’s carried to the Jardin des Tuileries and the unique cauldron that was used for the Olympics, which is attached to a hot-air balloon that will fly over the French capital every evening during the Paralympics. A video shows the journey the Paralympic flame has taken to get here. It was lit on Saturday by the British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Gregor Ewan in Stoke Mandeville, which is widely considered the birthplace of the Games. It then travelled to France, where it was split into 12 flames – representing the number of days the Paralympics will take place for – which have travelled around the country, from the Atlantic to Mediterranean coasts, from the mountains in the Pyrenees to the Alps, before arriving in Paris. And now Ravel’s Boléro is played as the flames come together, courtesy of 12 Paralympians, on the Place de la Concorde. Next one of my favourite musicians, the Frenchman Sébastien Tellier, provides an atmospheric soundtrack as we prepare for the arrival of the Paralympic flame. The ceremony has gone over its expected finish time of 11pm Paris time/10pm UK time, but I don’t think anyone wants this to end. Four French athletes read out the Paralympic oath, pledging to honour and respect their fellow athletes and the Paralympic spirit. The Paralympic flag is brought on to the stage by Britain’s John McFall, a bronze medal winner in Beijing and an astronaut, and the French sailor Damien Seguin, while Luan Pommier, a visually impaired musician, plays the piano. And then the flag is raised as the Paralympic anthem fills the Place de la Concorde, which is now illuminated a pale blue, as Pommier sings to a hushed silence in the crowd. Another special moment to add to the many we’ve had this evening. The camera then pans to the Arc de Triomphe, which has the Agitos logo, the Paralympic symbol, on it. Organisers are calling the current choreography “sportography”, adding: “It’s difficult to tell if you’re watching a dance performance, a sports game, or an art piece, blending dance, sport and art into a fictional game that highlights teamwork, where people with and without disabilities invent new sports in which everyone can participate.” There’s another group of dancers on stage, dressed all in white, with the obelisk acting as the centre point, as white beams point into the night sky. It’s a stunning image and the dance is meant to represent strength, resilience, perseverance and determination. Musa Motha, the star of Britain’s Got Talent and America’s Got Talent who lost his left leg to cancer, then joins the dancers, before they all depart and he’s the only one left. After his solo the rest of the dancers return. Here’s another VT, and the Canadian YouTube personality Molly Burke, who is blind, speaks. Then it’s Martin Petit, and the amputee Lucie Retail. They talk about their disabilities and how they perceive themselves and are perceived by others. This, unsurprisingly, is a much more thought-provoking ceremony than the kitsch spectacle that opened the Olympics. “Through the power of sport let’s show world leaders that unity if possible,” Parsons says, finishing off with a “Vive la France!” before inviting Emmanuel Macron to declare the 2024 Paralympics open, which the French president duly does. Now Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, speaks. “At a time of growing conflict and exclusion, let sport bring us together,” he says. “Let sport serve as a powerful force for good. Eleven days of sensational sport to enjoy together. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to champion your country’s rich diversity and celebrate the best of Paris, France and humanity. Let us open our minds wide.” He says the Place de la Concorde was central to the French revolution and tonight stages the start of another revolution. “Liberté, égalité, fraternité!” he exclaims. Estanguet continues. “Thank you dear athletes. There are 4,400 Paralympians in Paris. You are the best para athletes in the world. You represent 168 delegations. You inspire us. Above all, you will find an entire country in the love with the Games, who are so proud to host you for the very first time.” The crowd are stamping their feet in appreciation. And now it’s time for the formalities. Here’s Tony Estanguet, the president of Paris 2024. He welcomes everyone to the “country of love and revolution”. “Tonight is the start of the most beautiful of revolutions, the Paralympic revolution,” he says. He then tells the competitors: “Like our ancestors you have panache. Like them you are fighting for a cause bigger than you. In your case your weapons are your records. When they said it was impossible you did it. And tonight you’re inviting us to join you in your Paralympic revolution, to give everybody their full place. When the sport starts we will no longer see disabilities but champions. You have no limits, so let us stop imposing limits on you. A gentle revolution but one that is going to profoundly change us for ever. On the 9th September we will wake up different.” There’s a spine-tingling montage of the some of the greatest ever Paralympic moments. And next, Mesdames et Messieurs, it’s time to stand for La Marseillaise, as the French flag is raised, with the Eiffel Tower glistening in the background. The decision to stage the opening ceremonies outside the confines of a stadium was questioned during the damp start to the Olympic ceremony, but I think it’s turned out to be a wonderful move that has showcased the very best of Paris. The rest of the ceremony will now take place at the Place de la Concorde. This next section is called My Ability, and will give a voice to people with a range of disabilities. Here’s a VT. It begins with the statement “We’re not actually that different to everybody else” and sends a very powerful message over the next few minutes. Then it’s back to the Place de la Concorde stage, with a moving dance routine, featuring many dancers in wheelchairs, as the French performer Lucky Love sings. Richard Hallmark emails from Paris. “I think that the world may never have seen before so many disabled people all together in one place at one time, many of them seriously disabled, many others with hidden - not obvious - disabilities, and out and proud, not hidden at home, or in institutions, hiding with the shame of being disabled. That’s some progress.” I’m hungry. I wonder if there’s time for a bit of dinner before the next part of the ceremony gets under way. Channel 4 then helpfully cuts to an ad break so that’ll give me a few minutes. The ceremony is due to finish in about an hour’s time, in case you were wondering, and will end with the lighting of the Paralympic torch. “The Olympic Games were a huge success, with lots of spectators, great enthusiasm and a great atmosphere,” Hanquinquant said before the ceremony. “Of course, we’re all hoping to experience that at the Paralympic Games too. “We’ve got some iconic sites, and we’re going to get an eyeful. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. I think we’re going to have a pretty exceptional Paralympic Games. The first leg is over, now there’s the second leg. Come and cheer us on, you won’t be disappointed. The party goes on.” And last but not least it’s the hosts. Cue the earworm Les Champs-Elysées, which was played so many times during the Olympics. “Aux Champs-Élysées/Aux Champs-Élysées/Au soleil, sous la pluie/À midi ou à minuit/Il y a tout c’que vous voulez/Aux Champs-Élysées,” rings out as one of France’s main hopes for gold, the triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant, carries their flag. Now it’s Australia, the hosts of the 2032 Games, followed by the USA! USA!! USA!!!, the hosts in 2028. The American flagbearers are Nicky Nieves and Steve Serio. And here are the 140-strong Ukraine team. It’s remarkable that many of them have made it this far. Para sport budgets were slashed when the war started, as state funding was diverted to the army. Ukraine finished fifth in the medal table in Tokyo but, in the words of my colleague Nick Ames, have had to “stretch resources to the limit to make it to Paris”. He has this report on Ukraine’s Paralympic swimmers: The music has veered from dance music, to jaunty Euro pop, to the 1970s, with about 40 delegations left to come. Ukraine will be guaranteed a welcome as warm as that for the Refugee Team, and they will be arriving soon, as we move on to the small delegations of Togo, Tonga and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Zakia Khudadadi is one of the members of the Refugee Team. Born in Afghanistan, she represented her country in taekwondo in Tokyo just days after being evacuated from the country. She now lives in France, unable to return to Afghanistan, so will feel the strength of support from the home spectators. Palestine receive one of the loudest cheers of the evening so far. And there’s a huge standing ovation for the Paralympic Refugee Team. Representing as many as 120m forcibly displaced people worldwide, this team is the biggest in their history, featuring eight athletes. Even the VIPs are on their feet. I meant to mention when Italy arrived that the sprinter Valentina Petrillo will become the first openly transgender athlete to compete at the Paralympics, having been selected to represent her country in the women’s T12 classification for athletes with visual impairments. The 50-year-old, who transitioned in 2019, will run in the 200m and 400m. In 2021 more than 30 female athletes signed a petition that was sent to the Italian Athletics Federation challenging Petrillo’s right to compete in women’s races – but she says her participation in Paris will be an “important symbol of inclusion”. Emmanuel Macron looked very pleased to see Keir Starmer earlier, by the way. I wonder what Starmer said to him. The camera pans to the illuminated Arc de Triomphe, with the sunset having now given way to the night sky. And the obelisk at the Place de la Concorde is looking magnifique too. That’s the end point for the athletes’ parade – which we’re now halfway through, well alphabetically speaking at least, as Mongolia are introduced to the crowds. Also spotted getting in the party mood: Josh Widdicombe, of Channel 4’s Last Leg and formerly of this parish, along with his co-host Alex Brooker. Well played Josh, partying in Paris probably beats helming this live blog from my London office bedroom. The Greek delegation decide to pay tribute to their hosts as they arrive with French flags … Ireland’s team of 29 soon take the applause … and then it’s Italiaaaa. Phew, we’ve still got a way to go yet. ParalympicsGB are hoping to match their impressive medal haul from Tokyo. They’ve set themselves a target of 100 to 140 medals this time, having won 124 three years ago, with cyclists Sarah Storey, Kadeena Cox and Jody Cundy, athletes Jonnie Peacock and Hannah Cockroft, and tennis player Alfie Hewett among the leading medal hopes. And it’s a big month for Cockroft, who’ll be getting married just three weeks after the Games. Gambia, Georgia … and here come Great Britain! Prime minister Keir Starmer stands up and applauds, as Bywater and Shuker lead the team of 215 athletes who will compete across 19 sports, with 116 men and 99 women. The oldest British representative is the 54-year-old canoeist Jeanette Chippington, who first represented ParalympicsGB at Seoul 1988 – while the youngest is swimmer Iona Winnifrith, aged just 13. If there were medals on offer for dancing, I’d give some to Ecuador, who are pulling some moves as they parade along the Champs-Élysées. The Parisian sky still looks incredible, a golden mix of yellow and orange, it’s so vibrant it almost looks like AI. It couldn’t be more different to the wet and cold weather that put a bit of a dampener on the Olympics opening ceremony just over a month ago. Soon it’s China, who finished second in the medal table at the Paris Olympics and top at the Tokyo Paralympics with 207 medals. Second in Tokyo were ParalympicsGB, with 124, ahead of third-placed USA. Britain’s flagbearers tonight, by the way, are Terry Bywater and Lucy Shuker. The 41-year-old Bywater is part of the wheelchair basketball team and is competing at his seventh Games, while Shuker is at her fifth Games as a wheelchair tennis player. “I feel quite emotional,” Bywater said yesterday. “This is my seventh Games, I actually wear the No 7 vest too – so this is all a bit crazy right now. I’m just super, super proud.” Meanwhile Shuker said: “Leading the parade down the Champs-Élysées and Place de la Concorde is going to be really different – eyes will be on me, but also the rest of ParalympicsGB. We are a big team and to be at the front of that is insane, incredible and an honour.” The huge delegation from Brazil make their entrance, including their star Petrúcio Ferreira, the fastest Paralympian in the world. He’ll be aiming to retain his T47 100m title. Belarus, of course, are absent as the war continues in Ukraine. While the team are banned, along with Russia, some Belarusian and Russian athletes will be taking part as neutrals: the Neutral Paralympic Athletes delegation will feature up to eight competitors from Belarus and 90 from Russia. As we move from the As to the Bs, the ParalympicsGB chef de mission, Penny Briscoe, has been speaking about the train ordeal that Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson suffered on her way to Paris, saying it shows the need for the team to use their platform to push for social change. Clearly, it’s an absolute disgrace. It’s the lived experience of disabled people on a daily basis though, it just doesn’t get reported. As ParalympicsGB we’re trying to inspire a better world for disabled people through sport. It doesn’t matter if that’s education, if that’s in life, in society, we want change and our athletes want change. You should, as a disabled person, be able to get on and off a train and go about your daily living but the reality is far more difficult than that. You can read more here: Now it’s time to welcome the athletes. Afghanistan begin the parade, rather than the refugee team who went first in Tokyo. The teams will parade in alphabetical order – and if this follows the Olympics, France will come last, as hosts, with the two teams in front of them likely to be Australia (as the hosts in 2032) and the USA (the hosts in 2028). It’ll take up to 90 minutes for all the delegations to make it along the Champs-Élysées. Oh well, at least tonight’s athletes aren’t getting soaked on very wet barges. As the dancers continue doing their thing, the French singer Christine and the Queens arrives to do his, with a unique take on Non, je ne Regrette Rien by Édith Piaf. Apparently he’ll be back for more later. And here’s a fly-past in the sky. It’s all going on. With the sky now a golden orange, it’s a stunning sight as the blue, red and white vapours draw a line over the sunset. That Phryge car Now here’s the Canadian pianist Chilly Gonzales. He starts playing as two sets of dancers take to the stage, with one group representing mainstream society and the other diversity. And now here comes Curin in his taxi, he pulls up and takes to the stage. “WELCOME TO PARIS!!!” he screams as the colours of the Tricolour shoot up into the Parisian sky. As the sun sets behind the famous obelisk on the Place de la Concorde, the action gets under way. The ceremony is called “Paradox: from discord to concord”, to reflect the struggle that Paralympians have gone through. It starts with a video featuring the French Paralympic swimmer Théo Curin. “I’m going to be the taxi of the Paris 2024 Games,” he says. He then drives around Paris in a taxi absolutely covered with the official Paris 2024 mascot, Phryge. “Welcome to Paris!” Curin exclaims, as the coverage switches back to the live scenes. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the International Paralympic Committee, Andrew Parsons, are introduced to the cheering crowds. Meanwhile Ade Adepitan, who will be writing for the Guardian during the Paralympics, has been reflecting on London 2012, saying it “created heroes and redefined what the British public would understand as a role model”. He wonders whether the French can harness something similar – “to see if they really understand the power of engaging that disability hero factor” – and if this can actually effect social change. His first column of the Games is available here: The Paris Olympics definitely brought new fans to the Games – and the hope is that the Paralympics will do the same. Incredible sport is guaranteed over the following 11 days, with events ranging from the physicality of wheelchair rugby to the precision of boccia. But for many (including me) what is so special about the Paralympics is the amazing human stories of resilience amid adversity, and the transformative power of sport for disabled people, epitomised by the France’s longest-serving Paralympian Ryadh Sallem. He’s been speaking to our Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, about his “rendezvous with destiny” at his home Games and how sport saved his life. When the French wheelchair rugby team play their first match on Thursday, all eyes will be on Ryadh Sallem, whose extraordinary journey from thalidomide baby to record-breaking athlete has made him one of the country’s best-loved and longest-serving Paralympians. Sallem, who will turn 54 at the Paris Games – his sixth Paralympics – is best known for competing in several sports. He began as a swimmer, breaking the 1991 world record for the 400m individual medley. Then he learned circus juggling techniques in order to become one of the first wheelchair basketball players without two full hands. After Paralympic basketball, he chose the fast-paced intensity of wheelchair rugby, which he describes as a combat, gladiator sport, competing in London and Rio. Finishing his Paralympic career in Paris, his home city, is a “rendezvous with destiny”, he says. Sallem was born in the Tunisian coastal town of Monastir, with no legs, no left hand and a malformation of his right hand. His mother had taken the drug thalidomide, which was used in the 1950s and 1960s for morning sickness but led to thousands of children worldwide being born without limbs. “My grandfather fought for France in the second world war and he told my parents: ‘If you want to save your child you have to take him to France,’” he says. So, at the age of two, Sallem’s father took him to a French hospital rehabilitation centre outside Paris. Sallem would spend almost 20 years living in what he described as a hospital setting with a school attached – a kind of hospital boarding school – where he had numerous surgeries. You can read the full interview here: We’re now 15 minutes away from the start of proceedings. About 4,400 athletes from a record 182 delegations will parade along the Champs-Élysées, starting at the Arc de Triomphe and ending at the Place de la Concorde, which will host the rest of the ceremony. It’s currently a balmy 28 degrees in Paris, in contrast to the cold and wet weather that opened the Olympics, so the scene is set for a memorable evening in the French capital, which is currently glistening in the sunset. From the sports to the venues to which stars to look out for, here’s a handy guide to the Paralympics, courtesy of Paul MacInnes: What are the Paralympic Games? Eleven days of elite competition across 22 sports. With no fewer than 549 medals at stake, 4,400 athletes will be taking part from 128 different nations, each of them with a physical or cognitive disability. When does it start? The opening ceremony for the 17th summer Paralympic Games will take place in Paris on Wednesday 28 August from 7pm UK time. As with the Olympics this summer, the ceremony will be staged not in a stadium but in the city, with the location shifting from the River Seine to the Champs Élysées. A “people’s parade” will be accessible to the general public before arriving at the Place de la Concorde, formerly the site of the Olympic “parc urbain”, which will then stage the climactic portion of the evening and the lighting of the Paralympic torch. The sporting action begins the next day. Where will the sport be played? A number of the venues you fell in love with earlier in the summer are set to return, with 18 of the 35 Olympic locations being repurposed for the Paralympics. The Stade de France and La Défense Arena will once again host athletics and swimming, respectively, and cycling will return to the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome. The sand has been removed from the Eiffel Tower stadium so that blind football can replace beach volleyball. The only event to be held outside the French capital will be the para-shooting in Châteauroux. What time will the action be on? You have probably already adjusted your body clock to the challenges of consuming sport from the French capital and for those in the UK it’s not very hard (it’s an hour ahead). The sport will begin at 8.30am in the morning local time and end at 10.30pm. What are the key events? Much like the Olympics, the centrepiece of the Paralympic Games is the track and field programme. The competition begins on Friday 30 August, runs for nine days and produces medals every day. Both Saturdays are particularly stuffed, with 7 September boasting no fewer than 22 finals over its two sessions. Other marquee events to look out for will be the wheelchair rugby final on Monday 2 September and finals day in the para-rowing at Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium on Sunday 1 September. Which British stars should we look out for? Of the 215 athletes that form the ParalympicsGB team this year there are 81 debutants, meaning a great chance for new heroes to be made. Among those fresh names, look out for 19-year-old cyclist Archie Atkinson (racing in the C4 pursuit), the 13-year-old swimming prodigy Iona Winnifrith (going in the SB7 100m breaststroke and SM7 individual medley) and Rachel Choong, world champion in para-badminton who is making her debut at the Games after her classification was finally included in competition. You can read the rest here: Stats time. Records will be broken at these Paralympics, with the highest ever number of both delegations (182) and female athletes (about 2,000). The number of female participants is expected to be at least double that at Sydney 2000 and they will compete in a record 235 medal events. Plug time. If you didn’t sign up for our Paris 2024 daily briefing during the Olympics, it will also be running throughout the Paralympics. Do subscribe for free here. And the thoughts of the president of the International Paralympic Committee, Andrew Parsons: The concept was always that [by staging the event] in the Champs Élysées and the Place de la Concorde it’s like the city’s embracing the Paralympic athletes, the Paralympic movement. We are seeing it as a gigantic hug for our athletes and this cannot be more positive. More from the Paris 2024 president, Tony Estanguet: I believe French people are going to be able to make a difference, to make these Paralympics their own. We went beyond what we dreamed of with the Olympics, creating a true fervour, and I believe it’s going to be the case with the Paralympics as well. We decided on purpose to position the Games during back to school in France because we want to take advantage of the opportunities it offers. Back to school is a good time to send messages to students, to show inclusion and accessibility, to provide an opportunity for education. Here’s a taster of what we’re going to see ce soir. Bon soir! So 17 days after the Olympics came to an end, it’s time to do it all again as the Paralympics get under way in Paris. Hourra! I think it’s fair to say that Part Un exceeded expectations – as the early French indifference towards the Olympics, poor weather and transport problems gave way to a joyful celebration of nationalism and sport – and there’s already a sense that Part Deux could do the same. Yes, there’s some local scepticism about the timing of the Paralympics, which coincide with the end of Les Vacances in France, and it’s predicted Paris will welcome about half the number the visitors that travelled for the Olympics. But after months of concerns over low ticket sales and questions about whether the French would embrace disability sport, there’s been a big upturn in interest, with more than 2m of 2.5m tickets sold and many events selling out. In order to send out a message of inclusivity and accessibility, tickets aren’t needed to watch tonight’s athletes’ parade, which won’t be staged at the Stade de France but will instead take spectators, competitors and TV viewers to the landmarks of Paris – just as the Olympics opening ceremony did. About 4,400 athletes from 182 delegations will be parading along the Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe before arriving at the Place de la Concorde, which provided such a memorable backdrop for the Olympic skateboarding, BMX and breaking competitions. The Place de la Concorde will then host the artistic performances and the lighting of the Paralympic torch. Organisers are keeping the names of tonight’s performers under wraps – but after the Olympics opening ceremony included performances from Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, along with a guillotined Marie Antoinette, the Minions fighting over the Mona Lisa and the controversial but unintentional Last Supper parody, it’s probably wise to expect the unexpected. What the Paris 2024 president, Tony Estanguet, has said is that “the ceremony at the heart of the city is a strong symbol illustrating our ambition to capitalise on our country hosting its first ever Paralympics to position the issue of inclusion for people with disabilities at the heart of our society”. La cérémonie commence à: 20h Paris time (7pm UK time). But it’s not all about parades and pizzazz, you know: the competition begins tomorrow morning in sports including track cycling, swimming, taekwondo and table tennis, with 549 gold medals on offer over the following 11 days."

                    "headline": "Nvidia rides big tech’s AI investment to beat Wall Street’s sky-high expectations",
                    "bodyText": "Chipmaker Nvidia reported its latest financial results on Wednesday, recording $30.04bn in revenue over the past three months – a 122% jump from the year prior – and showing that artificial intelligence investment mania shows no signs of cooling. Analysts had anticipated about $28.7bn in revenue. Shares slid more than 3% in after-hours trading. In an earnings call, founder and CEO Jensen Huang said he expected Nvidia to ship “a lot more” chips and hardware next year than the company had in its 31-year history. “The reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to drive its costs down, and we want to increase the scale of AI models so that it will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and realize the next industrial revolution,” he said. Analysts welcomed the results, despite signs that Nvidia’s extraordinary sales growth might ultimately slow. “The company continues to benefit from a market paradox: big tech’s aggressive AI investment strategies drive massive demand for Nvidia’s chips, even as these same companies invest in developing their own silicon,” said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst with Emarketer. Nvidia has told customers that its next-generation AI chips, code-named Blackwell, will be delayed several months from January, though early samples are shipping to a small group of customers now. However, its current line of graphics processing units, nicknamed Hopper, continues to sell well, chief executive officer Jensen Huang said in a press release. “Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,” Huang said. “Nvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.” The company’s data center revenue, its most closely watched financial metric, increased by 154% from a year ago to $26.3bn. Recent earnings reports from Nvidia’s main big tech customers – Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google – which use the company’s chips to build and train their own AI models, indicated higher capital spending as AI demand continues to rise. “As competitors like AMD intensify their efforts, the timely release of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chip will be essential for maintaining its dominant position in the increasingly competitive AI chip market,” said Bourne. The importance of Nvidia’s earnings results to Wall Street can hardly be overestimated – the company represents 6% of the total value of the S&amp;P 500, currently the third most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at $3.1tn. The index has gained 27% over the past 12 months, but Nvidia is individually up 167% over the same period. But because big tech is driving US stocks to new record highs, and because spending on Nvidia is seen as a signal of future tech earnings, Nvidia’s results are a key barometer of the US stock market. The company also reported $0.68 in earnings per share and announced a $50bn stock buy-back. Analysts expected $0.64 per share for the quarter, compared to $13.5bn in revenue a year earlier. Profits were seen at $15.1bn, up from about $6.2bn a year earlier. The company’s last earnings, released in May, showed quarterly growth of 18% and annual revenue growth of 262%. Against that extraordinary precedent, anything less than a repeat could be seen as a disappointment. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called Nvidia’s earnings call “the most important week for the stock market this year and potentially in years”. Ives estimates that for every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU chip, there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the tech sector. “In a nutshell, we expect another drop-the-mic performance from Nvidia, as right now Jensen &amp; Co are the only game in town with $1tn of AI cap-ex [capital expenditure] on the way for the next few years with Nvidia’s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world,” he added. The expectations are so high, in fact, that Ameriprise Financial’s Anthony Saglimbene told Bloomberg that the results could have more impact on the overall market than Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s speech last week at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But placing so much emphasis on a single stock itself rests on the concept that AI will boost global productivity over the coming decades. The enormous $100bn annual investment into AI has yet to translate into profits for big tech, and its not yet clear when they will arrive. Conversely, a disappointing set of results could leads to doubts – and that we are at peak AI hype. That’s led to comparisons to the late 1999 Internet bubble when the sector crashed but later recovered as the online world we know today on its skeletal remains. In his market hand-holding mode, Ives said in a note that investors may worry about the huge spending, but the circumstances are more like 1995, when investment was pouring into the internet’s infrastructure, and not like 1999 when the bubble burst. “Tech earnings season has only bolstered and validated this bullish view of tech stocks heading into year-end and 2025,” Ives says. As with Microsoft in the early 2000s, regulators are hovering over Nvidia. Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into the tech giant. Rival chipmakers have alleged the company has abused its market dominance to corner the market and coerce its customers into continuing to purchase its products."

                    "headline": "Make AI tools to reduce teacher workloads, tech companies urged",
                    "bodyText": "Tech companies are being urged to create better AI tools for reducing teachers’ workloads, as ministers announced they would give AI models special access to the Department for Education’s (DfE) bank of resources. The education minister Stephen Morgan said the move was “a huge step forward for AI in the classroom”, with the government spending £3m to create a “content bank” of official assessments, curriculum guidance and teaching materials. While many teachers say they already use AI to assist them, current AI tools are not trained on material specifically designed or approved for use in England’s classrooms. The new content bank will allow developers to train their AI models to generate “accurate, high-quality content” such as workbooks and lesson plans, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). A further £1m will be awarded to developers in a competition for the best ideas to use the DfE’s database in reducing teacher workload. Each winner will build an AI tool to help teachers with feedback and marking tasks by March 2025. Morgan told an international education conference in South Korea that the initiative was the first government-approved store of high-quality education material optimised for AI development. “Artificial intelligence, when made safe and reliable, represents an exciting opportunity to give our school leaders and teachers a helping hand with classroom life,” Morgan said. “This investment will allow us to safely harness the power of tech to make it work for our hard-working teachers, easing the pressures and workload burdens we know are facing the profession and freeing up time, allowing them to focus on face to face teaching.” A research report, published on Wednesday by the DfE, found that using targeted content to train an AI model could increase its accuracy from 67% to 92%. Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said AI had the potential to ease the “overwhelming” burden faced by teachers, if concerns about its reliability could be resolved. “However, it is important to recognise that AI is a tool, and not something that can replace the human expertise and interaction with students that can only be provided by our highly skilled and professional education staff,” Di’Iasio said. “The immediate problem is that we are struggling to recruit and retain enough teachers because of the previous government’s erosion of pay and conditions over the past decade and a half. This is the issue which needs urgent attention.” Chris Goodall, a teacher and head of digital education at the Bourne Education Trust, said he had been using AI to create classroom material since November 2022, and now helps teachers use it to improve lessons and cut down on administration in 26 schools across the trust. “I’ve used AI to quickly generate scaffolded activities, adapt materials for students with special educational needs, and create more engaging lessons that are accessible to all. The time saved allows school staff to focus on what matters most, interacting with students and providing individualised feedback and support,” Goodall said. A study of attitudes to AI in education, published by the DfE and DSIT’s responsible technology adoption unit, found that most parents supported teachers using AI to support their work but were more hesitant about direct interaction by pupils. The study noted that participants were worried about “the loss of key social and technical skills and reduced human contact time leading to unintended adverse outcomes”."

                    "bodyText": "Artificial intelligence and algorithmic tools used by central government are to be published on a public register after warnings they can contain “entrenched” racism and bias. Officials confirmed this weekend that tools challenged by campaigners over alleged secrecy and a risk of bias will be named shortly. The technology has been used for a range of purposes, from trying to detect sham marriages to rooting out fraud and error in benefit claims. The move is a victory for campaigners who have been challenging the deployment of AI in central government in advance of what is likely to be a rapid rollout of the technology in the public sector. Caroline Selman, a senior research fellow at the Public Law Project (PLP), an access-to-justice charity, said there had been a lack of transparency on the existence, details and deployment of the systems. “We need to make sure public bodies are publishing the information about these tools, which are being rapidly rolled out. It is in everyone’s interest that the technology which is adopted is lawful, fair and non-discriminatory.” In August 2020, the Home Office agreed to stop using a computer algorithm to help sort visa applications after it was claimed it contained “entrenched racism and bias”. Officials suspended the algorithm after a legal challenge by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the digital rights group Foxglove. It was claimed by Foxglove that some nationalities were automatically given a “red” traffic-light risk score, and those people were more likely to be denied a visa. It said the process amounted to racial discrimination. The department was also challenged last year over an algorithmic tool to detect sham marriages used to subvert immigration controls. The PLP said it appeared it could discriminate against people from certain countries, with an equality assessment disclosed to the charity revealing that Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian and Albanian people were more likely to be referred for investigation. The government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, now the Responsible Technology Adoption Unit, warned in a report in November 2020 that there were numerous examples where the new technology had “entrenched or amplified historic biases, or even created new forms of bias or unfairness”. The centre helped develop an algorithmic transparency recording standard in November 2021 for public bodies deploying AI and algorithmic tools. It proposed that models which interact with the public or have a significant influence on decisions be published on a register or “repository”, with details on how and why they were being used. To date, just nine records have been published in three years on the repository. None of the models is operated by the Home Office or Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which have operated some of the most controversial systems. The last government said in a consultation response on AI regulation in February that departments would be mandated to comply with the reporting standard. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) confirmed this weekend that departments would now report on use of the technology under the standard. A DSIT spokesperson said: “Technology has huge potential to improve public services, but we know it’s important to maintain the right safeguards including, where appropriate, human oversight and other forms of governance. “The algorithmic transparency recording standard is now mandatory for all departments, with a number of records due to be published shortly. We continue to explore how it can be expanded across the public sector. We encourage all organisations to use AI and data in a way that builds public trust through tools, guidance and standards.” Departments are likely to face further calls to reveal more details on how their AI systems work and the measures taken to reduce the risk of bias. The DWP is using AI to detect potential fraud in advance claims for universal credit, and has more in development to detect fraud in other areas. In its latest annual report, it says it has conducted a “fairness” analysis on its use of AI for universal credit advance claims which did not “present any immediate concerns of discrimination”. The DWP has not provided any details of its assessment due to concerns that publication could “allow fraudsters to understand how the model operates’’. The PLP is supporting possible legal action against the DWP over use of the technology. It is, pressing the department for details on how it is being used and the measures taken to mitigate harm. The project has compiled its own register of automated decision-making tools in government, with 55 tools tracked to date."

He says: “I love the light at the end of day, and the shadows that appear when the sun is leaving. Whenever I go out to take photos in the late afternoon it’s because I’m looking for the longest shadows I can find.” On the beach, you come across groups playing altinha, a Brazilian version of keepy-uppy. “You don’t let the ball fall, and keep it up high, without using your hands, but in the most beautiful way possible,” he says. The exchange rate in Brazil prohibits Riani from upgrading his iPhone 6s Plus to a newer model, but he perseveres. “On the 6s Plus, shooting at night is impossible, but I can still make interesting images in the day,” he says. Editing is a point of pride for Riani: “My professional background is in the creative side of advertising, so tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom and Illustrator are essential to my creative process. I deconstructed this entire photo and cut out the major elements, including Morro Dois Irmãos, the two mountains in the background. Then I worked on the background and remade the image, leaving only the elements that interested me. This was the resulting image. “Some people think I use AI, but everything is manual, pixel by pixel,” he adds. “What makes me happiest is when people say my images look like a dream.”"

                    "bodyText": "Google’s new superphone goes all out on battery, camera and smarts, leading a new line of Android devices that can run the company’s Gemini AI system with a next-generation conversational voice assistant that is a huge leap forward. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the biggest normal phone Google makes, costing from £1,099 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,849) and is joined for the first time this year by a smaller 9 Pro model with the same specs and camera costing £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699). The XL is therefore for people who want a huge screen and big battery. The design of the phone is even more brutish and interesting than last year’s Pixels. The camera bar on the back now stands fully proud, reminiscent of Google’s Nest Doorbells in shape. The sides of the aluminium body have been flattened off, resembling Apple’s iPhone 14 Pro Max, too. The huge and super-bright 6.8in screen rivals the very best from Samsung and others, coming into its own when watching video or using it outdoors in direct sunlight. Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G4 chip, which is up to 20% faster for browsing and 17% faster when launching apps, feeling a bit snappier in day-to-day usage than predecessors. The XL handles games and apps just fine, but it is not up to par with rivals from Qualcomm and Apple on raw processing performance in benchmark tests. Instead, Google designed the chip with the help of its Deepmind subsidiary to increase efficiency and AI processing power, allowing it to run the company’s Gemini Nano system and other models significantly faster. The result is noticeably longer battery life than its predecessors. The 9 Pro XL lasts up to 52 hours with more than seven hours of actively using the screen on a mixture of 5G and wifi. That is a solid two days between charges and rivals some of the longest-lasting phones available. Specifications Screen: 6.8in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (486ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G4 RAM: 16GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 14 Camera: 50MP + 48MP ultrawide + 48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm Weight: 221g Next-gen AI features The Pixel ships with the same Android 14 as previous models and seven years of software support, making it one of the longest-lasting phones on the market. The big new additions are all AI related. The 9 Pro XL is one of the first phones to run Google’s latest Gemini Nano AI models on the device, which has enabled a series of new features injecting AI into all sorts of places, from the keyboard to the weather app. One of the most interesting is the new Screenshots app to collect your screen caps and make them searchable, so you can ask it for a ticket reference for a concert you saved and it will give you a summary and show you the right page. Sometimes it’s summary isn’t 100% accurate, but it’s close enough to show you the right screenshot for a quick glance. The Pixel Studio app quickly generates images in a range of styles via text prompts, allowing you to edit them, insert objects and turn portions of the image into stickers. It is quite fun but needs an internet connection to work. It won’t yet generate images of people or other blocked terms, and struggles with text on images. Magic Editor in Google Photos has a few upgrades, too, including the ability to automatically reframe an image by cropping or expanding the canvas using generative AI. The “reimagine” feature goes one step further and can fully recast a photo using a text prompt, such as making it look like a cityscape is sunken under water. There are safeguards on what you can insert into images, but as with all things they can be circumvented. How far you go with it is up to you. Gemini Live The most impressive AI feature is the new Gemini Live experience. Unlike text chat or previous voice assistants, Live is fully conversational with human-like responses including a bit of personality and just the right level of brevity. You simply speak to Gemini as if it was a person for a flowing back and forth open conversation. One conversation I had discussed the fastest parkruns in south-east London, detailing the quickest courses for a personal best. It told me all sorts of facts about each park, including the running surfaces and the travel time via car or public transport for a start from my home. We then discussed the predicted weather and whether the number of people likely to be in attendance could be a hindrance. It isn’t perfect all the time. It can go on a bit, but you can just talk over the top of it to interrupt it. In one conversation about boys names, it kept suggesting “Jasper” over and over, sounding almost comically obsessed by it. But in all my interactions with it, Gemini Live is light years ahead of what you’d get from Siri, Alexa or others, and actually feels like something I could use daily. It is not exclusive to the Pixel, but Live does require a £19-a-month Gemini Advanced subscription to access, a year of which is bundled free with any of the Pixel 9 Pro phones. Camera The 9 Pro XL’s triple camera setup on the rear is similar to last year’s Pixel 8 Pro, featuring 48MP ultra wide, 50MP main and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera, all of which are excellent. It captures very detailed and crisp photos across the board but is particularly good in low light and preserves detail in high-contrast scenes very well. The Pixel has an additional 2x zoom option on the main and 5x telephoto cameras, the latter producing the equivalent of a 10x optical zoom to meaningfully close the distance to objects. The additional digital zoom up to 30x is very good in bright light, too. The new 42MP selfie camera on the front is noticeably brighter and a bit sharper than previous iterations. But Google’s new “Add Me” feature may be the best for group shots. It blends two photos taken back to back to allow the photographer to be added to group shots by swapping over camera duties with another member of the party for the second photo. An augmented reality overlay shows where the additional people should position themselves to be in the combined shot. It works pretty well but requires the second photographer to know how to use the mode properly so took a bit of practice to get right and it sometimes couldn’t handle certain objects, such blending legs erroneously into the edges of tables. The camera app has many other fun and creative modes but the Pixel is still better than any other at getting good photos in tricky conditions with no user knowledge required. Sustainability Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google and third-party shops, with genuine replacement parts to be available from iFixit soon. Screen replacements will cost about £200. The Pixel 9 Pro is made with at least 18% recycled materials, including recycled aluminium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Google will recycle old devices free of charge. Price The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL costs from £1,099 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,849). For comparison, the Pixel 8a costs £499, the Pixel 9 costs £799, the Pixel 9 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,149 and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max costs £1,199. Verdict With the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Google has produced its first true superphone to rival Samsung’s S24 Ultra and Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro Max. A huge and glorious screen, long battery life, standout looks and a class-leading camera make it one of the best phones you can buy. It is really big, however, requiring two-handed use most of the time, so if that’s a problem its smaller sibling the 9 Pro may be a better option. Google’s cutting-edge AI additions continue to be a mixture of fun tricks and useful tools, particularly in the camera department, with features such as Magic Editor and Add Me. Gemini Live is a most impressive new thing and meaningfully improves on AI assistants on a phone, but whether it will be worth paying a monthly fee for after the free first year remains to be seen. The increased price this year stings but the Pixel still undercuts Samsung and Apple’s rivals, and will receive seven years of software support so it should last a long time. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5 and 10x optical zoom, great screen, great battery life, recycled aluminium, impressive local and generative AI features, Gemini Live included for a year. Cons: bump in price, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance short of best-in-class, temperature sensor is still a gimmick outside the US, AI doesn’t always get things right."

                    "bodyText": "Latino and Black-led Democratic and progressive organizations are mobilizing to come up with novel uses of AI to reach voters of color. On Discord, a social messaging app that connects gamers, it’s taking the form of a smiling chatbot powered by artificial intelligence that evokes Pixar’s animated robot Wall-E. When you click, a conversation opens up that says: “This is the very beginning of your legendary conversation with Vote-E.” You can ask election related questions such as “How do I register to vote?” or when North Carolina’s voter registration deadline is – and the answers are almost instantaneous. Vote-E is an experiment in how to crack one of the toughest problems for Democrats – reaching voters of color, especially younger ones, using platforms where they actually spend time, and persuading them to vote for Democrats. And it comes at a transformative, but uncertain time for the party, with Kamala Harris replacing Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, who must use existing infrastructure to beat Donald Trump. NextGen America, which built Vote-E and is one of the nation’s largest youth voter organizations, says it allows young men to access the bot from Discord chats and Twitch streams of Latino and Black gaming influencers. “We’re seeing voter turnout gaps between Black men and women and Latino men and women,” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, NextGen America’s president, noting that while there’s a focus on connecting with young people on college campuses, not everyone is there. The chatbot is active in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina. It’s just one example of progressive groups of color experimenting with artificial intelligence which wasn’t on their radar four years ago: AI chatbots are now also recruiting Latino voters from WhatsApp and Black voters from Facebook Messenger; they’re using natural language processing to record voter interactions with canvassers and identify shared concerns; and even using it to index and identify friendly Spanish-language sites to place an ad touting Democrats’ clean energy plan. With the election mere months away, the challenge facing Democrats remains how to galvanize younger voters and voters of color. While more Latinos turned out in 2020 than ever before, Hispanics still lag behind white, Black, and Asian and Pacific Islander voters as a proportion of their population of eligible voters, according to Catalist, a progressive data hub, which noted this is true across communities of color, “where non-voting rates are substantially higher”. Héctor Sánchez Barba, the president and chief executive of Mi Familia Vota, told companies he was less interested in their diversity dollars than in their budgets and expertise in the realm of data, research, and innovation. It’s why he recruited Denise Cook, a Cuban American former enterprise software architect who spent 16 years at IBM to join MFV as its chief data and innovation officer. She leads an all-Latina team, which created its own chatbot and uses AI to have human-sounding, bilingual conversations with Latino voters on platforms like WhatsApp. Canvassers with the group ask for permission to record conversations with voters on their mobile phones or tablets. Those interactions are then turned into data using natural language processing, a type of AI. This way, MFV is able to quickly summarize voter priorities and figure out if it is speaking about the economy, reproductive rights or climate optimally to voters. “We need this kind of brainpower when we’re fighting the biggest enemy our community has ever had,” Sánchez Barba said of Trump. “This is about using the most important technological advancements, including artificial intelligence, for good and to save our democracy.” Many leaders of color said they are mindful of pitfalls around AI but open to harnessing its power and testing possible strategies. Larry Huynh, the president of the American Association of Political Consultants and the founder of Trilogy Interactive, is so interested in incorporating AI into political campaigns that he followed leaders in other industries by creating an internal taskforce at his company. He believes campaigns should follow the lead of brands, which use AI voiceovers of celebrities and public figures, to have their natural mouth movements seamlessly disseminate campaign messages. Huynh’s research has found AI voices tailored to their target audience – young male speaker, young male voter, say – appear to be more persuasive. One example he gave is of an allied group creating a video of the candidate – now Harris – speaking perfect Spanish in her own voice aimed at Arizona or Nevada voters. “If it’s well-delivered and it doesn’t seem odd or off, some voters could appreciate that communication in their predominant language,” he said. Putting out a wholly AI-made Harris, however, would be highly scrutinized both from within the party and by Republicans. Harris is already a target of deepfakes that put words in her mouth as well as ones meant to sexualize and demean her. Yet another deepfake of her, even a positive one, could strike the wrong chord. A Trump has said she used AI to fake a huge rally crowd. The photo of her campaign stop was real, though. Concerns over disinformation have only been heightened by the spread of AI-generated images of Trump getting arrested in New York and an AI robocall that mimicked Biden’s voice telling New Hampshire voters not to cast a ballot. Still, progressive groups are charging forward. Poder Latinx, an advocacy group committed to building Latino political power, created an ad touting the clean energy plan from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. It was timed to coincide with the popular Copa América soccer tournament last month. Partnering with Mundial Media, the group was able to serve the ad to US Latinos reading Spanish-language news sites in places like Arizona. Mundial Media’s Cadmus AI engine crawled the sites and indexed their keywords to make sure the soccer-themed clean energy ad would fit in with the content on the pages. Yadira Sanchez, the co-founder of Poder Latinx, was happy with how the campaign reached voters, over-delivering impressions and click-thru rates from Latinos, including finding a 64% Hispanic male audience. “We know that the best connection is voter to voter contact. This technology is complementing the on-the-ground canvassing we are already using,” she said. “Technology, AI in particular, is great to reach younger, more online voters.“ But AI may not be viewed as safe enough for initiatives that require serious resources to scale up in time for November. And there are concerns it could freak out voters in the wrong context. In focus groups in Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia this year, Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPac, found “hesitation” from Black voters around AI. “There’s a concern people have with what they’re seeing and where it’s coming from exactly,” she said, noting voters “don’t know what to trust and are suspicious and skeptical of everything.” Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a group that advocates for Black Americans and has a $25m program for 2024, has met with Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, alongside senior staff at Meta, Google and OpenAI, to call for commitments on how AI will be used around election tools, which he says aren’t ready for primetime. “Imagine if there were no regulations for cars and it was all about who could get their new vehicle to market fastest?” he said, citing Musk’s Tesla, which has recalled its latest model four times. “It’s Tesla on steroids. At least cars get recalled, but there is no infrastructure or body that recalls tech.” Quentin James, founder and president of The Collective Pac, a group that works to elect Black Democrats and is using the Facebook Messenger chatbot to get registration information from voters, stressed that deepfakes or ads where one campaign is using the likeness of their opponent to mislead voters should be shut down immediately. Still, he said, Democrats must be willing to use the tools at their disposal to beat Trump, because the other side will be looking at them as well. “I don’t know if FEC law can catch up to this in a few months, so we should use it to our advantage,” he said. “There’s no way we can control what happens with technology in this short time period.”"

                    "bodyText": "This is where we’ll wrap up the blog for today – but first, a quick recap: Indigenous affairs minister Linda Burney has said “community-led truth” is key to reconciliation in her valedictory speech to parliament. Bill Shorten announced the government has agreed to amendments on the NDIS bill. Anthony Albanese has said “nastiness is not a strength” as questions about Palestinian visas continued from the Coalition during question time today. Independent MPs are suggesting term limits on federal politicians to curb the normalisation of disrespectful parliamentary behaviour, urging political leaders to follow the advice of the Stop It At The Start advertising campaign and “stop it at the top”. The domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner, Micaela Cronin, has called for governments to make DFV an “election issue” during a press club speech she gave gefore the tabling of her inaugural report on the issue. Every day in Australia, on average, one child has a hospital stay related to domestic or family violence. Mark Dreyfus’s deepfake porn legislation – which criminalises the non-consensual creating and sharing of it- passed the Senate with no amendments. 90% of the 120 frontline housing organisations surveyed for the Everybody’s Home People’s Commission report ranked stress or mental-ill health as one of the biggest impacts of the housing crisis, the second was homelessness. Almost a third of all flights in Australia during July were cancelled or delayed. ‘Unfair’: Victoria’s court interpreters speak up as hours slashed Language interpreters claim their profession is being undervalued by Victoria’s court system as their hours and pay have been slashed to save costs, AAP reports. Those facing court from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds or who are deaf are at risk of not getting access to justice following cuts by Court Services Victoria, interpreters say. Spanish interpreter Blossom Ah Ket told AAP on Wednesday: We haven’t seen a pay rise in six years, so if anything we needed a pay rise and we’ve got a pay cut. Interpreters are sick and tired of feeling disrespected and not valued for the essential and critical work we do in the justice system. These pay cuts, as well as affecting us personally, will result in worse conditions and worse results for the people we serve. Most court interpreters are employed as contractors or on a casual basis by language providers such as LanguageLoop. Those those who provide services to the state government had their minimum pay rates increased in 2018. The workforce, much of which is made up of migrants, refugees and women, has not received a pay rise since then. AAP has contacted Courts Services Victoria for comment. CBA to pilot AI to distract scammers AI technology that uses convincing conversational bots to bait scammers will be used in a CommBank pilot. Scammers will waste their time talking to bots like Malcolm, a confused elderly man. And Apate’s technology, Apate.ai, will not only distract the scammer, but collect and share intelligence on them. Apate is a “spin out” from Macquarie University, which has now announced a pilot program using the AI to “deploy a disruptive anti-scam technology comprised of realistic multilingual bots designed to keep scammers on long fake calls to divert them away from the many victims who lose money to global cybercriminals every day”. The uni will work with CommBank to share intelligence, to detect and disrupt scams. Apate.ai chief executive officer and the uni’s cybersecurity hub director, professor Dali Kaafa, said: Our mission is to disrupt scammers’ business models globally. This proactive approach against scam calls will make it much harder for fraudsters to reach actual victims. Apate.ai’s technology is about staying ahead of the scammers. The bank will be able to get real-time alerts before the scammers contact its customers, who can then be notified. You can read all about the technology here: Burney has said the referendum on the voice to parliament didn’t achieve the outcomes “many of us wanted” but that she believes it can and will be a “catalyst for progress”. She goes on to say that “community-led truth” would help build the shared narrative that Australia is lacking, adding “there is nothing to fear or lose from the truth”. Burne continued: I believe it can and will be a catalyst for progress and positive change in our nation, that in the years that come it will be looked on more kindly by history; because constitutional recognition has been championed for decades by many of you here and the government and parliament finally had the courage to put the question to the people, because of the role it played in inspiring a new generation of young Indigenous leaders to emerge and also some of you here and push the change for a better future, because it showed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities overwhelmingly wanted the voice to be heard, and 6.3 million Australians said yes. It highlighted how far we’ve come and how far we still must go to be a truly reconciled country. Progress doesn’t always move in a straight line. The road is rocky. There are obstacles in the path. We have our stumbles and our setbacks, but our overall direction is towards progress and, with each passing generation, we bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. Burney then said she thinks “Australia sometimes struggles with our identity because we never came to terms with our own story, never embraced the breadth and depth of it, certainly not its truth”/ She said: The generosity we pride ourselves on is rarely extended to the people in this nation who have occupied these lands for countless generations. Why? Part of the answer is that we don’t have a shared narrative. You take the whole, not just the bits that suit you. I believe that community-led truth … can help with that there is nothing to fear or lose from the truth. Burney has said celebrated the achievements in Indigenous affairs – including justice reinvestment, improvements to remote housing and drinking water, and rolling out dialysis units and building the health workforce. She said the steps forward were a “team effort”: These steps forward are a team effort. Ministers stepping up, ministers taking responsibility for delivering for Indigenous people in their portfolio. The whole Labor cabinet doing its bit. This is a profound and incredibly important improvement because when I arrived in this place in 2016 it felt like issues affecting affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had been pushed into a silo to be dealt with only by the Indigenous affairs minister who, quite frankly, will never have their hands on the levers of employment, health, education and other portfolios where the big changes will be made. Former minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney is delivering her valedictory speech to the House of Representatives. She has reflected on her time in parliament, “walking a path never before been walked by someone like me” as the first Indigenous woman elected to the House of Representatives: As I stand here today, I am deeply reflective and immensely grateful for the journey I have shared with you all in this parliament. When I first entered this House, I knew I was walking a path that had never before been walked by someone like me, the first Indigenous woman elected to the House of Representatives. A path paved with hope, with responsibility and a deep commitment to representing not just my own community of Barton but all Australians, including, of course, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am humbled by the trust and the ownership shown by First Nations Australians, many of whom are still paying a heavy price for dispossession and exclusion from our nation’s foundation and too often, exclusion from the institutions which exist to serve us all. Burney announced she would be retiring last month and stepped away from the frontbench: Thanks Amy! And good afternoon everyone. I am going to hand you over to Jordyn Beazley while I complete another task. We’ll be back with politics live from early tomorrow morning – which will be the last day of this sitting. Huzzah. Hope you have a lovely evening – and please, take care of you. Sussan Ley accuses Zali Steggall of ‘unprofessional’ attack on Dutton Asked about the complaints some of the teal independents have raised about standards in the House during debates and question time (which has been backed by the Speaker, Milton Dick, who said in the House last week he noticed an increase in noise from the Coalition benches when one of them stood up to make a contribution), Sussan Ley says: The teals need to understand that standards apply to them, that they cannot just say whatever they want and that, if they’re talking about behaviour in the chamber, the need to consider their own behaviour. Recently, [Zali Steggall], made some personal and particularly nasty attacks on our leader, Peter Dutton. There were unprofessional, they were not responsible and they were repeated inside and outside the chamber. Imagine if somebody walked into the ABC studio and said to you, or David Speers, you’re a racist and then repeated [it] over and over again, would that be acceptable? Would that be professional? So, I’m waiting to see what the independent teals are going to do to address their fellow member because no one called her out on that. Sussan Ley is speaking to the ABC about the government independent parliamentary standards commission legislation and says while the Coalition will work with Labor, it won’t be rushed by Labor’s “timeline”: We will take that through our shadow and a party room processes and our backbench committees and we will consult. Full Story podcast – Why Dutton wants to close the door to Gazan refugees The Coalition might be running out of steam in their attack lines over Palestinian visas if today’s QT was anything to go by, but it doesn’t seem like it will drop it anytime soon. That is partly because the clock is ticking on the first visitor visas running out – they only last for a year. The government has to come up with a fix, as people cannot return to Gaza. Karen Middleton and Mostafa Rachwani talk through some of the issue in the latest Guardian Full Story podcast: Transport data shows 30.9% of all flights in Australia cancelled or delayed in July The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie, who has the shadow portfolio looking after aviation, has some cheery news about flight delays and cancellations based on the latest data (from the month of July): 30.9% of all flights were cancelled or delayed in July (compared to 25.2% in June). Total cancelled and delayed flights increased by 34.6% since June (15,323 flights in July, compared to 11,384 in June). For flights between Melbourne and Sydney, 8.8% of all flights were cancelled in July. 10.7% of Qantas flights were cancelled. 8.1% of Virgin Flights were cancelled. 7.6% of Jetstar flights were cancelled. In the month that Rex Airlines entered voluntary administration, Australia’s airlines delivered their worst on-time performance since March as 30% of flights across the country were cancelled or delayed, according to data released by the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics. That exchange over visa approvals continued: James Paterson: Sure, and this is no fault of the people applying for the visas, but most people who apply for visas are not applying from war zones, and they’re not applying from jurisdictions that are controlled by terrorist organisations. You would think that that would necessitate greater scrutiny. Michael Willard: I’m very confident that, if someone wasn’t meeting all of the criteria for the grant of a visa, then the visa would not be granted. Paterson: How can you know, if you’re taking only an hour or less to consider it? Willard: Because it’s the application of all of the information we hold to the individual’s particular circumstances, which might be such that we already know this person or we hold overwhelming information that makes us confident that the person meets the criteria. Paterson: Just finally on this matter, was anything about the process expedited or modified in any way to facilitate applications? Willard: No. The assessment of the individual applications against the criteria was complete and was a standard assessment. What we have been doing is taking a similar approach to what we’ve taken in previous situations where there’s been unrest or war zones – and this goes back to Afghanistan, but also Ukraine and Sudan. It is that we do apply priority processing to people who have strong Australian connections who are seeking to travel. Paterson: What about any flexibility about identity verification or documents that they have provided? Willard: No flexibility – if we’re not satisfied of identity, we won’t be granting the visa. What’s the source of the Coalition’s ‘one hour’ visa turnaround claim? We have reported on this a few times, but for the people up the back, this is the exchange the Coalition appear to be relying on for much of their attack lines on this issue. It is from February. Not a big deal was made then, but for *reasons* the Coalition is now speaking about this six months later – and almost four months after the last Palestinian from Gaza was able to enter Australia before Israel shut the Rafah border. Paterson asked: There’s been some controversy about this in the media, and the minister for foreign affairs, among others, has reassured the public that no processes were expedited, no corners were cut – all the usual processes were followed. But there was also a media report by the ABC on 9 December, entitled “Australians turn to WhatsApp group for help to get family members out of Gaza”, in which some individuals claimed their visitor visas for relatives were approved within one hour. Does that sound right to you? Is it possible that a visitor visa was approved in a single hour? Michael Willard, a deputy director in the immigration department answered: It is possible. I’d make this point in terms of the way we assess a visitor visa: we draw on a vast range of information that we hold, and we apply that information to the circumstances presented in a visitor visa application. There could be circumstances where someone, for example, has a strong travel record, is well known to us and has a routine that we’re familiar with, where the visitor visa could be granted in that time frame. Paterson: Sure. But how could you possibly do all the necessary security and other checks in just an hour for an applicant? That’s lightning-speed approval. Willard: When we apply that vast range of information to consideration of visitor visas, if you look globally, a very large number of our visitor visas would be done inside an hour. The assessment is essentially looking at all the information we hold and applying it in a number of ways to the application in front of us. It appears the Coalition is running out of steam on the issue it’s created around security for Palestinian visas, but it remains determined to continue pushing it. Peter Dutton did not ask a question today. The opposition leader was largely silent. It has been some time since Dutton did not ask any questions. The Coalition is also trying to present its theories and attack lines as fact. There is no evidence for the claim that Palestinian visas were approved “in an average of 24 hours” and in some cases “an hour”. That original claim appears to come from a story about a group chat where these claims were made. James Paterson asked about them in Senate estimates in February and an immigration official answered in the broad – not in the specific context of visas for Palestinians. Anthony Albanese and Labor now seem just as determined to turn the attack back on the opposition and Peter Dutton specifically, seeking to define him as ‘divisive’. Labor is attempting to set up a contest between what it is focusing on – cost of living – compared to what the Coalition is focused on – an issue around visas it has created itself. NIB and St Vincent’s private hospital network reach new funding agreement St Vincent’s private hospital network has reached a new funding agreement with NIB, meaning the private health fund customers no longer face the threat of higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs which have loomed since negotiations between the parties broke down. In July, Australia’s largest not-for-profit health and aged care services provider St Vincent’s gave notice to NIB that it intended to end its funding agreement after a notice period which ended on 3 October. St Vincent’s, which operates 10 private hospitals in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, said NIB had failed to put a fair offer on the table that recognised the rising costs of providing private hospital care. While it was the first time in St Vincent’s 167-year history it had given notice to a private health fund that it intended to end an agreement, Ben Harris, the director of policy and research at Private Healthcare Australia predicted that a resolution would be reached, just as similar scenarios between other private providers and insurers had played out in the past, because it’s in both parties’ best interests to do so. St Vincent’s CEO, Chris Blake, said he welcomed the new funding deal which appropriately recognises the rising costs of providing private hospital care. While the details of the new agreement are commercial-in-confidence, Blake said the deal would allow St Vincent’s to cover its costs when providing care to NIB members in its private hospitals. Times have never been harder for private hospital providers in Australia. As a not-for-profit social enterprise, St Vincent’s needs to be able to cover its costs.” I’m very glad both parties have been able to use the notice period to dig a little deeper and reach a fair and mutually satisfactory agreement.” For private health care to operate effectively, health funds and hospitals need to work together, for the benefit of members and patients”. Health service contracting group Honeysuckle Health, acting on behalf of NIB, confirmed St Vincent’s remains in contract with NIB, ensuring NIB members can continue to limit their out-of-pocket costs for treatment at St Vincent’s facilities. Anthony Albanese ends question time (a little earlier than usual) and Allegra Spender asks Milton Dick to make a statement on the standard of conduct in the house. In this parliament we have a behaviour code soon to be legislated, that requires parliamentarians to, and I quote, ‘treat all those with whom they come into contact in the course of their parliamentary duties and activities with dignity, courtesy, fairness and respect’. The conduct that is demonstrated in this chamber, particularly during question time, is unlike any workplace I’ve ever been in, and I think we would have a hard time convincing the public, including those perhaps in the gallery today, that we comply with this code. I would like to ask the speaker to review the behaviour, language and standards in recent weeks and make any necessary statements relating to them. Dick says he will. I agree with her. We must find ways to better engage in debate that maintains respectful behaviour and in particular, upholding the standing orders. I shall reflect on standards and behaviour in recent times and report back to the member. And we are all set free. Until tomorrow. Communications minister says 3G switchover to be delayed to 28 October There is about to be a mass advertising campaign reminding people to check if their tech is on 3G. Michelle Rowland said: There’s a subset of handsets which use 4G for voice and data, but are configured by the manufacturer to use 3G for calls to triple zero. Now, this category of handset is of concern, because it won’t be apparent to end users that they can’t call 000, and they’d only discover this during an emergency when they’re actually trying to make the call. So following interrogation by my department earlier this year, industry figures showed that up to 740,000 devices in this category may be impacted. On receiving the advice as to the scale, I immediately stood up. An industry working group overseen by my department that enabled fortnightly updates on device numbers and progress on community and customer outreach efforts. The cooperation by the working group enables me now, Mr Speaker, to advise the House that the number of devices in this high risk category has reduced from 740,000 to around 73,000. Now, that’s a significant reduction, but both government and industry believe there is more to be done. To that end, the government welcomes the announcement by Telstra and Optus that they will delay their respective 3G network switchovers until 28 October. ‘We will respect every one of you’: PM to western Sydney electorates Anthony Albanese continues: Well, I say this to those opposite. You can continue to sledge people in western Sydney. What I’ll continue to do as prime minister is represent the entire nation here, including the good people of Western Sydney. They know that we take the same advice from the same security agencies as the previous government did. We’ve rejected more than 7000 visa applications. The member for Groom might not know because he just asked the question he was given, so I don’t blame him, that the Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities, and it has been closed since May. … I say this to the good, good people of Watson, Blaxland and McMahon that we will respect every one of you, regardless of who you are, regardless of your faith, regardless of your ethnicity. Anthony Albanese: There were more people [who] came from Syria under visitor visas from when they were in government, when Isis was in charge of large amounts of Syria, than the 1,300 people who have come from the occupied Palestinian territories. And can I note this as well? There have been 5,491 visitor visas granted from Israel as well. And let me say this. Those people are welcome here. They are welcome here. But we see what is going on here. It is so obvious. And the member … is certainly very conscious of it, which is why, you know, it’s a shocker when no one on the frontbench will ask it. That’s right, that’s right. Goes up the back, goes up the back in order to sledge a whole group of people who live in western Sydney. That’s right, that’s right! In one of the earlier questions in parliament this afternoon, Dan Tehan alleged that the government was “cutting corners on security assessments to bring in 1,300 people from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone”. In light of this claim, it might be worth re-upping this exchange with Asio chief Mike Burgess in a podcast interview with Guardian Australia in March: Guardian Australia: I’m raising the following question, only because it’s been raised by a major political party in Australia, not because I want to cast aspersions on an entire community. The Coalition has raised security concerns about the approval of visas for hundreds of Palestinians fleeing the conflict. And the Liberal senator James Paterson said in November that he’s “not reflecting on Asio … but I really hope pressure hasn’t been put on them or the Department of Home Affairs to cut corners, or do this more quickly than they already would”. What role does Asio have in the security checks for those visas? And can you give that reassurance? Burgess: There’s many elements to that question, so let me break that down for you. Asio has a role in the visa process. I won’t explain that fully because we don’t want people to game that process, but I can assure you Asio is involved. Home Affairs has the lead and Home Affairs knows what it’s doing when it comes to these processes. If there was pressure put on my organisation, I have an obligation under Australian law to protect my organisation from politicisation or anything that’s inappropriate, and I would take action if that happened. I haven’t needed to do that. I’m confident we’re doing our job well and where we see problems we deal with them effectively. Of course, we’re not all seeing and all knowing and information available to everyone including Home Affairs is not 100%, but I’m confident the process is where it needs to be. But we keep an open mind to that. And we remain vigilant. Guardian Australia: So if there was any doubt, you wouldn’t sign off on a particular individual? Burgess: Well, our role – obviously, if we have grounds to say that we are going to impact that individual, we have to have the evidence and that’s subject to a rigorous assessment. It can’t just be I feel there’s it’s a bit of doubt, so we’ll do it. We don’t work that way. Coalition MP labels Palestinian visas a ‘visa for votes’ scheme targeted at western Sydney LNP MP Garth Hamilton has been handed a question from the tactics team which he appears to be reading for the first time, given how he delivers it. Prime minister, why is Australia handing out tourist visas to Gazans from the terrorist-controlled war zone in an average of 24 hours, and in some cases, as quickly as one hour, while bypassing all the usual checks, including those the former Coalition government used in Syria? Will the prime minister admit that the government’s visa for votes scheme was only done to shore up votes in the seats of Watson, McMahon and Blaxton? There is no proven suggestion of an “average” of 24 hours for approvals. The “one hour” reference appears to have come from reports on a group chat, which were raised in Senate estimates in February. It was not confirmed, but the immigration official said it was “feasible” a visitor visa could be approved so quickly, if someone had an established relationship with Australia (for example was a regular visitor, meaning that authorities already had a lot of your information). The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, said security checks were done – not just with his agency, but through the usual processes, set up under Home Affairs. Visas are also constantly crosschecked, which is how some ended up cancelled after they were granted (it is not a set and forget process). No one has been able to leave Gaza (except in the rare cases of medical evacuation) since Israel officially seized the Rafah border in May. As for “shoring up votes”, the Labor MPs are under extreme pressure because what communities have seen as a lack of action. Greens senator questions Labor on funding to end gendered violence In the Senate, the Greens senator Larissa Waters asks when the government will commit more funding to services for women facing violence, saying they need $1bn extra each year to meet the demand and noting that at least 45 women have been murdered this year by current or former partners. Her question follows the lunchtime address to the National Press Club from the domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner Micaela Cronin, in which she warned the services needed more support. Representing the social services minister, Senator Jenny McAllister says “too many women are killed by their current or former intimate partner” and that the statistics confirm it is a crisis. It’s a pretty stark reminder of the human cost of this violence. McAllister outlines what the government has done under the national plan to end gender-based violence. We have been focused on supporting economic security so women don’t have to choose between property and violence. We’ve been investing in housing, so women know they have a place to go. We have been strengthening the legal system’s response to gendered violence. She says the government is also sharpening the focus on prevention. So we can end gendered violence in a generation. Waters urges the government to develop an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander violence prevention framework for men and boys, given the prevalence of violence perpetrated against Indigenous women. McAllister says the government is committed to collaborating with Indigenous women to improve the situation. Paul Fletcher raises a point of order at the end of that answer about the imputation and asks that the prime minister withdraws it. There are a lot of heckles from both sides of the chamber. “Someone call the wam-bulance” can be heard coming from the Labor frontbench. Along with “it’s the truth”. Milton Dick rules that no one was named, so no one was maligned. Coalition ‘maligning a whole group of people’ who are ‘suffering enormously’: PM Anthony Albanese continues: Because, there was a time when the Liberal party would have seen that people, whether they were fleeing Ukraine, Israel, Syria, Vietnam, Gaza at the moment, would have had some understanding, some understanding that this was the worst time, the worst time to try to just malign a whole group of people who are suffering enormously. Something that we see on our TV screens every night. You know, this morning, you turn on the radio, the latest hit was a school in Gaza with real people devastated and losing their life. We have faith in our security processes, we have faith in our intelligence agencies. They work, our security and law enforcement agencies do their job on an ongoing basis. We have faith in them. The opposition apparently don’t, even though they’re the same security agencies and indeed, the same personnel [as when they were in power]. We talk about character. When it comes to targeting groups, whether it is Lebanese, people in the south Pacific, Chinese, the entire continent of Africa – they’re all fair game. If you’re an au pair from Europe and someone can pick up the phone – no problem, you’re in. Albanese: Liberal party founder Menzies ‘wouldn’t recognise this mob today’ Anthony Albanese answers the Tehan question by quoting the founder of the modern Liberal party: Let me begin by quoting a character, Robert Menzies. This is what he had to say; ‘It is a good thing that Australia should have earned a reputation for a sensitive understanding for the problems of people in other lands. We should not come to be regarded as a people detached from the miseries of the world. I know that we will not come to be so regarded for, for I believe that there are no people anywhere with warmer hearts and more generous impulses.’ That was the founder of the Liberal party. He wouldn’t recognise this mob today. Tehan made to withdraw imputations in question on national security Dan Tehan is now back. It seems he has also had enough. Will the prime minister concede that in cutting corners on security assessments to bring in 1,300 people from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone on tourist visas, he has made Australia less safe? Will the prime minister admit that this visa for votes scheme was only done to shore up votes in the seats of Watson, McMahon and Blaxland? Doesn’t this go to his true character? He is made to withdraw the imputations in the question. There has been no suggestions that corners were cut on security assessments. The Asio boss Mike Burgess said that security procedures were carried out. It is not unusual to bring people who need a quick visa stream – because of things like war – into Australia through visitor visas. Kate Lyons has done an explainer on that here. If any Palestinian was to apply for a humanitarian visa, they would still have to go through the rigorous humanitarian visa process. The 1,300 or so people who are in Australia from Gaza have strong family connections and security agencies have information on who people are staying with. Anthony Albanese on Peter Dutton: And, I would think that people will be having a look at this bloke, who, ever since he walked into the parliament, as a new member, has always looked to divide. Has always looked to bring Australians apart, not to bring Australians together. Even when he has left his parliament, as he did during the [national] apology, it was all about divisions and then he apologised for it. He said that Lebanese migration was a mistake under the Fraser government. And then, he said he apologised for it, it’s just he apologised to [ABC journalist] Annabel Crabb, not to anyone in the Lebanese community. He has not apologised to Africans in Melbourne, [when he] said people can’t get out. He continually, he continually looks to pretend, to pretend he’s so strong – but nastiness is not strength. Nastiness is not strength. And punching down on vulnerable people is not strength. That is what it is. It shows Australia who he is every day. PM returns accusations of ‘political expediency’ After a back and forth on points of orders and relevance, Anthony Albanese returns to the floor and takes aim at the Coalition and Peter Dutton specifically: I’m speaking about the political expediency of those opposite. They’re not concerned about cost-of-living pressures. They’re not concerned about jobs. Not concerned about wages. Not concerned about our economy. [They’re] not concerned about social policy. Not concerned about the environment or tackling climate change, or any of the issues that Australians are talking about in their households. [They’re] more concerned about the Middle East than middle Australia. It exposes their political expediency, because they don’t have an agenda. They’re yet to come up with a single costed policy. LNP continues question time attacks over Palestinian visas The LNP’s Angie Bell asks another question about how Palestinian visas were approved. The question doesn’t matter as much – it is pretty much the same as we have been hearing all week – but it is obvious that Albanese has had enough. Bell ends her question with: Was this decision based on security advice, or political expediency? Anthony Albanese: All visitor visa applications, and this goes to a previous question as well, are decided with the involvement of departmental staff, none are fully automated, we have dealt with this process. As people would be aware, and I’m sure the member is aware, the Rafah border crossing is closed. Those opposite said nothing about these issues when the visas were actually being introduced. Now, they’ve not been – they’ve not been delivered because people can’t get out of the Rafah crossing. And those know that. But, you know, that’s not the real point of this question, is it? It’s not to get an answer. It’s not to get information. It’s to sow doubt and to stoke division, and to create fear. And everyone knows it. LNP MP Llew O’Brien (who appears to have healed from his latest motorcycle crash – good to see) asks Anthony Albanese: Prime minister, of the reported 43 tourist visas your government granted, and then cancelled, to those from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone since October 7, 20 have been reinstated on appeal. Did ministerial intervention occur to support any of these 20 cases? Albanese: The member is asking me a question about ministerial intervention. There certainly has not been prime ministerial intervention. Labor has delivered ‘most significant’ online gambling harm reduction in last decade: PM Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Goldstein for her question and for sharing the very personal story of one of her constituents. That personal story indicates the fact that this is not something which is new. If someone with a 12-year-old daughter is speaking about her life experience when she was a child, then one would assume that is decades ago. And indeed, that goes towards the fact that gambling has been an issue in our society, I suspect, since man and woman walked and had a bet on who could ride a horse the fastest, or who could run from rock to rock, literally, probably, before there were buildings. This has been around for a long period of time. And in the last two years … (There are a few raised eyebrows at this analogy as more than a few people seem to wonder where the PM is going with this.) Albanese: In the last two years we have done more to tackle gambling harm than in the entire period before then, from when this woman was a young child watching her father waste away the assets in that family. More in two years. We have delivered the most significant online wagering harm reduction initiatives of the last decade, including mandatory customer ID verification, banning the use of credit cards for online wagering, forcing online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements. Zoe Daniel questions PM on partial gambling ad bans The independent MP for Goldstein asks Anthony Albanese: This week, a mum in my electorate emailed me. “I’m the daughter of a gambler. I grew up walking on egg shells. One minute he was full of love and joy, the next uncertainty and despair.” Her father gambled away the family’s live savings and then took away his own life. With a 12-year-old son, she says of gambling ads on TV: “it terrifies me”. Prime minister, how would you justify only a partial gambling ad ban to this mother, who fears for her child? They’re into it in Senate question time, and Western Australian Liberal senator Slade Brockman has kicked off, asking about the shortage of saline affecting agriculture as well as the health sector. Malarndirri McCarthy, representing the agriculture minister, is answering. In a slightly non-sequitur answer, she says: We all love beef. We all like to eat sheep … It is important. It’s good food. Turns out, she is referring to a spray Brockman had in the final few seconds before question time began, during which he condemned Anthony Albanese’s attitude to agriculture. McCarthy goes on to talk about what the government has done for medical manufacturing and the supply chain. In a supplementary question, Brockman returns to his pre-QT theme, accusing the government of having “contempt” for the ag sector. McCarthy fires back: We won’t be lectured on this side about the importance of supply chains. Government grilled over Gaza visas Sussan Ley has the next non-government question and Anthony Albanese and the tactics team have obviously decided they have had enough of the visa questions, given this answer. Ley: Of the almost 3,000 visas approved for people from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone, how many were approved by an automated process? And did not involve a referral to Asio? Albanese: I thank the member for her question, which goes to automated processes. I am reminded – I’m reminded of who is obsessed by automotive processes. When they took the humans out of human services. With catastrophic consequences for Australians. And that’s why they’re not concerned about the impact that they had in government, on robodebt, on real Australians. We’ve continue to be focused on the needs of Australians. We’ll continue to be focused on the issues that are of concern to them. We have – I have answered many questions about these issues, they’re obsessed by it, what we’re focused on is the same issues that Australians are interested in. Dan Tehan opens up the questions with a query over a Seven network report from its Canberra political editor Mark Riley. The 43 tourist visas the government granted and cancelled to those from the terrorist-controlled war zone in Gaza, 20 have been restated on appeal. Can the prime minister confirm this is accurate? Anthony Albanese: I’m asked about Mark Riley’s reports. His reports are always worth watching. He has reported on Channel Seven that Hamas didn’t take over the occupied Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip since October 7. They were actually there before hand. When those opposite were in government they granted 1,000 – 1,000 – visitor visas from people from the occupied Palestinian territories. I can certainly confirm of the visitor visas that have been granted since October 7, the only cancellations have been offshore. Just some context in regards to the question; the last election held in Gaza was in 2006. Hamas won 44% of the vote, and the more moderate Fatah won 41%. Half the population of Gaza is under the age of 18 and was unable to vote in the 2006 election. There were visas cancelled – and reinstated – as reported by the Guardian earlier this year. Visas were cancelled for a variety of reasons, including that authorities were investigating how someone may have left Gaza. You can read more about that, here: WA delegation arrives in Canberra ahead of nature law reform debate A delegation of Western Australians from across the farming, tourism, wine-making and wildlife care and community groups have arrived in Canberra to meet with politicians ahead of the federal nature law reform debate. The group want commitments of strong federal laws, after concerns were raised WA’s own state laws were being watered down. Rhiannon Hardwick, the Nature Program Manager at the Conservation Council of WA, said while WA was known for its mining interests, they didn’t speak for the whole state: We’ve come all the way to Canberra to show the federal government that voters in WA want stronger laws that protect nature and the places we love. We’re here to give voice to the overwhelming majority of West Australians who want nature protected. The loudest voices from WA are often the mega-rich fossil fuel interests but they don’t represent our communities. Michaelia Cash lashes PM for joke about beef exports The National Press Club address finishes. We now have just over 20 minutes until the third question time of the week. Liberal senator Michaelia Cash has got in ahead of question time to lash the prime minister for a joke he made at a rural women awards dinner last night: In his speech Albanese raised the dinner he had with Indonesian president-elect Prabowo Subianto, telling the room: “When we had dinner – beautiful Australian beef, not the live export, we made sure it was dead.” Cash is apparently outraged by the joke. This prime minister pretends he supports Western Australia but is happy to make our farmers the butt of his jokes,’’ Senator Cash said. What a disgrace – he’s moved to shut down a WA industry and then jokes about it. The live beef export industry should now be on notice that Mr Albanese is likely to do the same to them as he has done to the live sheep industry.” The government has ruled out making changes to the live cattle industry. DV commissioner discusses language used around domestic violence Returning to the Micaela Cronin’s point about language when speaking about domestic, family and sexual violence, what does she think is best practice? It is a tricky one, isn’t it? I was having a conversation with someone the other day about what we have learned, in terms of the way we talk about suicide and what we have learned about the importance of both having the conversation but being aware that it can be risky and dangerous for communities as well. We have the same issue when we talk about domestic family and sexual violence. We know there are risks of backlash, there are risks of copycat. We know where there have been some really graphic, traumatic instances occur, that actually it has caused ripple effects for other women, women who call up services saying “I have just had threatened to me, I am going to do the same thing to you.” We need to be very mindful in the way we talk about, I think domestic family and sexual violence. We need to be talking about it in a way that holds the people who use violence accountable but respectful of – and absolutely respectful of the women and not labelling them in terms of what’s happened to them and there are some very good guidelines that exist about that, that we need to be ensuring that media and anybody who has leadership around communicating about it is well educated in. NDIS reform deal ‘a devastating blow’ to disability community, says Lidia Thorpe Independent senator Lidia Thorpe is not a fan of the deal which has been done on the NDIS legislation: It’s a devastating blow to the community that undermines decades of progress on the rights of people with disabilities and will result in lives lost. The First Nations Disability Network has outlined serious concerns about this legislation. But again it appears Labor are ignoring First Peoples, preferring to listen to the Coalition instead. None of these decisions should be made by people who do not have disabilities. Micaela Cronin says she wants ‘all leaders to step up and do better': I want this to be election issue, I want this to be something that parties are recognising the need to be put in their best foot forward and committing to what we will see in future terms and I think we are seeing that, I think that as I said before, the national plan is a good foundation but will need to be thinking about how do we build on that going forward. The domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner Micaela Cronin says she is aware work is under way by the government to audit government payment systems to examine how they can contribute to harm in this space. I’m aware that that work is under way and we will be keeping an eye on that. Micaela Cronin says there is not one area that she thinks there needs to be material change, because the response needs a holistic response. Cronin says community legal centres do an “extraordinary job” and there needs to be a “much better understanding of the demand”. I do think that responses for men is critical and we need that not to be at the expense of response services, who are taking calls every day. I think the community legal services do an extraordinary job on the ground of wrapping whatever needs to be done around their services and they’re often not funded to do that, so I think taking a comprehensive view of what are the points in the service system that we need to be really looking at that uplift and across the country, is something that all governments need to be urgently paying attention to. ‘Systems are weaponised to harm people,’ says DV commissioner Micaela Cronin said addressing family, domestic and sexual violence, governments need to start thinking about systems: One of the things I want to call out in terms of thinking about our systems is that we know that systems are weaponised. Systems are weaponised to harm people. And all of our systems can be weaponised. We know child support security payments are weaponised. We know the family court is weaponised. The child protection system is weaponised against women and children. Cronin said the business sector had looked at changes in its sphere and the need to speed change up. Government needs to do the same. ‘We have seen an 11% increase in sexual violence in the last year’: Micaela Cronin Micaela Cronin says: The last financial year, 43 women were murdered in intimate partner violence, but the numbers are much larger than that if you start to include people, women, children and children who die as a result of family domestic and sexual violence. We have seen an 11% increase in sexual violence in the last year. First Nations women are 33 times more likely to be hospitalised, six times more likely to die. And 60% of LGBTQIA+ people will have experience [of] family domestic and intimate partner violence. That’s what many people will be facing today and always and it’s not something that many people want to look in the face all the time. It is something that advocates are courageously and bravely bringing to our attention so that we can do something about this. ‘We need to be talking with and about men more’ Cronin continues: Last thing I want to say about language is when we talk about – it’s not a great phrase to trip off the tongue but domestic, family and sexual violence. We are not talking as much about sexual violence and we rarely use the word “incest”. We need to talk more about sexual violence. Cronin says the national plan to end violence against women uses the word ‘men’ 129 times, but women is used 543 times. Four times more than we talk about men. We need to be talking with and about men more. We need to use ‘less passive language’ when we talk about DV, commissioner says Micaela Cronin makes the point that Australia needs to do better in the way it speaks about violence. The way we use language is important. We have come a long way from talking about violence, domestic violence, and equating it with a black eye. We are much more sophisticated in understanding that it is now about patterns of behaviour and talk about coercive control and the need to talk about social and systemic entrapment. So language is important. We often talk about violence, but when we say that it’s important to recognise that it is broader than physical violence. We also offer quite passive language. We talk about violence against women, rather than men’s violence. We use language that doesn’t make it as visible as it needs to be, that it’s predominantly men who perpetrate violence and it is predominantly against women. We talk about missing and lost women and children rather than women who have been actively disappeared and murdered. We need to be stronger and clearer and use less passive language. Domestic violence commissioner addresses National Press Club The domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner, Micaela Cronin, is delivering the press club speech ahead of the tabling of her inaugural report on the issue. We will bring you the main parts of the speech and then the bits you need to know from the question and answer. Linda Burney to deliver valedictory speech this afternoon Former minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney, will deliver her valedictory speech to the House of Representatives just after 4pm today. Burney announced she would be retiring last month and stepped away from the front bench. Mark Dreyfus’s deepfake porn legislation (which criminalises the non-consensual creating and sharing of it) has passed the Senate with no amendments. In a statement Dreyfus said: This insidious behaviour can be a method of degrading, humiliating and dehumanising victims. Such acts are overwhelmingly targeted towards women and girls, perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and contributing to gender-based violence. This Bill strengthens existing Commonwealth Criminal Code offences and introduces a new aggravated criminal offence to target those who use technologies to artificially generate or alter sexually explicit material (such as deepfakes) for the purposes of non-consensual sharing online. These offences are now subject to serious criminal penalties of up to six years imprisonment for sharing of non-consensual deepfake sexually explicit material. Where the person also created the deepfake that is shared without consent, there is an aggravated offence which carries a higher penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. And despite having a waste ticker and a truck with the waste ticker he drove around parliament (much like I-told-you-so(s) Shorten is hard pressed to walk past a stunt), Bill Shorten said “it is hard to estimate the amount of waste in the scheme”. Shorten: Telling the truth about the scheme seems to upset people. On one hand if we say it is changing peoples lives, some people will say some should not be getting it. On the other hand, when you say there is some waste in the scheme, other people will say you are trashing people with disability. The truth is in between. The truth is the NDIS is a great scheme. Australia as a country is investing more per capita on profoundly and severely impaired Australians than any other nation on the planet. That is something we should all be proud of. But we can make the scheme better. Shorten apologises for period products being labelled ‘lifestyle’ products in draft NDIS plan Going through the press conference Bill Shorten just held, he also included an apology for period products being labelled as “lifestyle” products under the draft NDIS plan. First of all, an apology. This is about putting out a list which by the way the government has done before. No good deed goes unpunished. (That is a reference to this government being the first to put out a list). He says the amendments will clear it up, and that period products designed for people with a disability will be accessible under the scheme. We have been going through the Everybody’s Home People’s Commission report into the housing crisis and it makes for sober (but sadly unsurprising) reading. The report included new data from a survey of more than 120 frontline organisations ranking the top impacts of the housing crisis on clients: • Nine in 10 (90%) ranked stress or mental-ill health as one of the biggest impacts • Three in four (75%) nominated homelessness • Three in five (57%) said forgoing meals, medication or other essential services • Two in five (39%) said disconnection from family or community • One in three (32%) said inability to leave an unsafe home environment. Prof Nicole Gurran from the University of Sydney’s School of Architecture, Design and Planning led the inquiry with former Labor senator Doug Cameron. Gurran said systemic failures led us here: An over-reliance on the private market has not and will not deliver the magnitude of affordable, secure housing that Australia needs. Instead, national leadership is needed to restore investment to social housing, fix the unfair and inefficient tax settings that fuel demand without delivering new supply, and ensure adequate rental subsidies and protections so that tenants in the private sector can access secure and decent homes. AAP reports Australia has sanctioned 20 Somali members of designated terrorist organisation Al Shabaab. The sanctions largely target senior leaders. From the AAP report: They stem from a United Nations Security Council resolution and subsequent committee targeting Al Shabaab urging members to put in place an arms embargo, travel bans and asset freezes. It also prohibited the import of charcoal from Somalia. The Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group was blamed by the Somali government for killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more during an explosion at a beach restaurant in the capital Mogadishu in early August. Militants from the group also captured a UN helicopter carrying out a medical evacuation that made an emergency landing in central Somalia in January. American forces killed leader senior leader Maalim Ayman in an operation with the Somali army in December 2023. He was responsible for planning terrorist attacks in Somalia and nearby countries, a Somalian minister said at the time when confirming the operation. Bill Shorten has never found an ‘I told you so’ he’s been able to walk past. He tells the journalists gathered at the press conference: Some of you have been writing that the states are not going to work with us. well, you’re going to need a new [headline] because we are getting on with it. Shorten said that cuts to growth (what the government would have spent) should not be confused with cuts to the NDIS. If people think we are spending less than we thought we spend, it’s a cut. The scheme has increased [in terms of] the number of people on the scheme from last year and in outlay of what we have spent. But generally, we are seeing a moderating. Lower than forecast growth in terms of outlays. And we will see what this produces next week in the NDIA statement. (The agency is due to hand down its latest financial statement next week) NDIS bill about making sure the scheme is sustainable, Shorten says Bill Shorten: There is not [just] one day where this scheme gets better but the passing of this legislation is basically the construction of the scaffolding which will allow us to co-design unique assessment tools … It will allow us to resolve our consultation with people with disability about a list of what you can spend money on and what you cannot spend money on. This will always be a work in progress but as we have seen, we are committed to making sure the scheme is here for the future. It is going at an unsustainable rate. Where I hope to get to at the end of the week is people get a clear steer of how we make sure there is not automatic top up, plans being exhausted early, how can we make sure what we can spend money on and not. Bill Shorten is hoping that the NDIS legislation will go through the Senate fast enough on Thursday that it can return to the house for the amendments to be ticked off, meaning the NDIS legislation would be passed by the end of the parliamentary session. All of this means that a deal has been done on the NDIS. In the Senate Labor and the Coalition have voted for a closure motion ensuring the NDIS bill will receive a final vote on Thursday. The motion, by finance minister Katy Gallagher, said: That on Thursday, 22 August 2024: 1 the questions on all remaining stages of the following bills be put at the conclusion of formal motions: National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024, Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024, Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Declared Areas) Bill 2024, Telecommunications Amendment (SMS Sender ID Register) Bill 2024, and Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill 2024Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2024; These bills will be voted on from 1:30pm Thursday. States and Canberra ‘getting their act together’ on NDIS, Shorten says Bill Shorten said the government is responding to the concerns raised by the Council for the Australian Federation – also known as Caf. I just say to people with disability and participants – the message is that the states and the federal government are getting their act together and people with disability and participants are not a political football. The different levels of government can come together to sort out issues in the best interests of their people as this has been accomplished. So the amendments presented last night reflect the arrangements which are being negotiated. The states are anxious that somehow a whole group of people on the NDIS would end up just being the responsibility of the state. That was never the intent and they are satisfied that is not the intent. The federal government wanted to make sure the states played their part. And we are satisfied the undertakings from the states in the proposals also do that. Bill Shorten is announcing the government has agreed to amendments on the NDIS bill. Specifically, there has been an agreement to introduce faster timeframes for approving NDIS rules, and the dispute resolution approach to escalate issues to first ministers. And a move from unanimous to majority first minister support for new rules for any impacts for people with disability and governments. (continued from previous post) Steggall said Peter Dutton’s behaviour in the House of Representatives encouraged his colleagues to emulate it. She said: He’s the first to turn around in those situations and yell out and heckle and the MPs under him – the Coalition MPs – take their cue from his leadership and that is unacceptable. And this is not conduct that is just of the opposition. We have also seen Labor MPs, I think, condoned by the prime minister, heckle other members of the crossbench because they do not agree with their ideology or position. That is also unacceptable. Spender also said the party leaders should do better. I note in the draft code of conduct for parliamentarians, it says, you know, ‘parliamentarians must treat all those with whom they come into contact in the course of their parliamentary duties and activities with dignity, courtesy, fairness and respect’. And I think we are a long way from that. Tink urged people to insist on better standards and to examine the legislation the government had produced after cross-parliament consultation in response to former sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins’ report on behaviour in parliamentary workplaces. “It’s not good enough to have something that’s there in the name only,” Tink said. It’s really important that this legislation is widely canvassed across the community, because this is the voters opportunity to have a direct say on how they want to see their parliamentarians behave. And if parliamentarians behave against those wishes, what are the consequences of those actions? Because at the moment, that level of transparency and accountability isn’t easily accessible by Australians. Independent MPs are suggesting term limits on federal politicians to curb the normalisation of disrespectful parliamentary behaviour, urging political leaders to follow the advice of the Stop It At The Start advertising campaign and “stop it at the top”. The New South Wales independents Kylea Tink, Allegra Spender, Sophie Scamps and Zali Steggall have expressed their dismay at the behaviour standards in parliament, noting new legislation the government is introducing to establish financial penalties for parliamentarians’ bad behaviour does not cover behaviour in the chambers themselves. This idea that robust debate excuses the behaviour in the chamber is absolute rubbish, and it’s the excuse that’s been used for far too long by far too many MPs that have been in this place for too long to justify poor conduct,” Steggall said at a joint news conference with the other MPs. “... I think the US system has its failings, but maybe the idea that there are limits on terms, at the very least, is interesting. I think it allows turnover of ideas.” Scamps said she regularly warns schoolchildren visiting Parliament House that the behaviour they will see in the chamber is not an example of how they should treat others. She said: Not only do we need a Stop It At The Start campaign, we need a ‘stop it at the top’ campaign. It’s the leaders that need to be role modelling the correct behaviour, and it starts with respect. Shorten to give NDIS update Bill Shorten has announced he will be delivering an update on the NDIS legislation at 11.15am. There has been growing unease and hostility within the community over the changes to the NDIS the legislation sets out. Shorten had hoped to have the legislation through the parliament by now, but is yet to find the numbers for it in the senate. The house has returned to the future made in Australia legislation debate, while the senate looks like it is going through the final motions of the deepfake bill. That one will make it an offence to share deepfake porn without consent. Every day in Australia, on average, one child has a hospital stay related to domestic or family violence. New data, published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on Wednesday, describes how fractures of the head are significantly more common among children attending hospital for reasons related to domestic and family violence than among children staying in hospital due to other reasons, such as falls or accidents. Between 2010 and 2021 there were 5,024 young people aged under 18 who had at least one family or domestic violence related hospital stay. Half (54%) were female, one-third (33%) were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, and over one-third (37%) had their first family or domestic violence related stay before the age of five. Parents were the most common perpetrator recorded. Most commonly, the first family or domestic violence hospital stay occurred as a baby (before age one). In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 and Lifeline on 13 11 14. If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault or family violence, call 1800-RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit www.1800RESPECT.org.au. The head of the Queensland Police Union has been appointed as the state’s first cross-border commissioner. Ian Leavers had been general president and CEO of the union since 2009 and a police officer since 1989. Legislation creating the position of cross-border commissioner is expected to pass parliament today. Premier Steven Miles announced this morning that the government will appoint Leavers to the role, which focuses on issues on the Queensland-New South Wales border. Miles said in parliament: His experience on the frontline, and his collaboration with emergency services, local, state and federal governments make him an ideal candidate for this role. I trust that Mr Leavers will help to break down barriers on the border and support our unique townships now and into the future. The Cross Border Commissioner will have a focus on improving the experience and livability of our cross-border communities. The Queensland police service’s First Nations advisory group called for Leavers to resign last year after an op-ed he penned last year which they criticised as “racist”. The division on the Greens motion calling for sanctions against Israel was completed, with a motion to adjourn the debate winning 83 to 6. If you want to see how the MPs voted (and who voted, because not everyone came into the chamber for it) you can see the record, here. More MPs sign letter to PM pushing for total ban on gambling ads Paul Karp reported on the letter that independent MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie had sent to the prime minister over the proposed gambling ad cap yesterday. More MPs are starting to sign on to it. The text of the letter reads: We are writing to ask the Government to legislate a blanket ban on advertisements for online gambling. While we are aware that no final decisions have been made, the reform package currently being discussed with stakeholders seems designed to prioritise broadcast media sustainability over public health concerns. The evidence presented during the Standing Committee on Social and Policy Affairs’ inquiry shows that partial bans don’t work. We are not aware of any contrary evidence that has emerged in the past 14 months while the government has been considering its response to the committee’s report. Australia has a proud history of prioritising public health in advertising regulation, with the banning of tobacco advertising serving as a useful precedent. We recognise that broadcast media face financial challenges and we would welcome a broader discussion about how to ensure ongoing media diversity in Australia. But falling short of a blanket ban on online gambling ads because of the potential impact on broadcast media sustainability commits us to a trade-off that Australians are unlikely to support. We ask that you proceed with the recommended blanket ban on ads for online gambling and deal with the important question of broadcast media separately and transparently. The house is almost empty, but a division is called after Wallace’s speech. No government MPs spoke on it, before the Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite moved that the debate be adjourned. You can read the whole motion, here. Coalition’s Andrew Wallace: ‘Where were the Greens on October 7?’ The Coalition’s Andrew Wallace says the party stands “strongly” against the motion, asking: “Where were the Greens on October 7?” Where were the Greens when 1,200 innocent Israelis were killed? Now, where were those Greens? Have the Greens, any members of the Greens, been to Israel? Have they been to see the sights of the atrocities? Have they bothered to watch the 43 minute video? Have they bothered to do that? You don’t have to go to Israel. Have you seen it? Have you seen the 43 minute video? Because if you haven’t, I encourage you to do it. The video Wallace is referencing is this one Greens call for sanctions against Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu This is what the Greens are asking the house to do: Sanction the State of Israel and members of the extremist Netanyahu Government, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich; and b. End two way arms trade with the State of Israel including the F35 parts manufactured in Australia and used in the State of Israel’s fighter jets. Bandt says ‘people want action’ not ‘hand-wringing words’ on Gaza The Greens leader Adam Bandt is seconding the motion on Gaza: Action, action. That’s what people want from their government when we witness a genocide and starvation and destruction of people’s lives and the re-emergence of polio and a court saying that the state of Israel is committing the crime of apartheid. People want their own government to take action. Enough of the hand-wringing words. Enough of the pleas and the supposed red lines that the extremist government of Benjamin Netanyahu then crosses every time without consequences. People want action. The Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather has moved to suspend standing orders in the house to debate Australia’s reaction to Gaza. Chandler-Mather: When will this country learn, and this government learn, whether it be Labor or Liberal – by the way, the Liberal party never reckoned, never reckoned with their disastrous invasion of Iraq. What is it, Iraq, Afghanistan? How many times do we have to follow slavishly into a war backed by the United States? And look at the consequences, the millions dead, and the reality is that it makes the world less safe. The US invasion of Afghanistan was apparently to get rid of the Taliban, and what do we end up with? After 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of deaths and the Taliban, they’re still there! And what happened when Australia backed the invasion of Iraq which some estimates said led to a million dead, a million dead – what did we end up with? ISIS. Good on you guys. You worked it out. It worked out real well. Great stuff. ‘It’s a debacle, quite frankly’: Sussan Ley on NSW Liberal party blunder Sussan Ley was asked about the firestorm around the New South Wales Liberal president Don Harwin after the NSW branch failed to nominate candidates (and incumbents) at the upcoming NSW local elections. The party had been considering legal action against the electoral commission but announced yesterday it would not be moving forward with any action. Asked if Harwin should go, Ley said: Everything that I am doing, and representing, in this area, as someone who sits on both the NSW state executive and the cederal Executive, is about winning the next federal election. That is my total focus. The party and its organisation will go through processes. I’m devastated for the candidates who missed out because their nominations weren’t lodged, and for the people in those local government areas who can’t vote for a Liberal. And it’s a debacle, quite frankly. But my focus 100% is on what we need to do to win the next election, and what we need to do in New South Wales to win the next election. The national campaign focused on addressing the nation’s housing crisis, Everybody’s Home, has released it’s final People’s Commission report. The report, which takes in the experience of more than 1,500 submissions and 100 organisations, details some of the issues with the housing crisis and how it is having wider ramifications. As AAP reports: The Australian government must invest in social housing if it wants to solve the housing crisis, an advocacy group says. To solve the crisis, the report recommends the government create 750,000 social homes within two decades, abolish investor tax concessions and deliver housing justice for Indigenous peoples. The report’s commissioner and former Labor senator Doug Cameron urged housing minister Clare O’Neil and the Albanese government to take the findings seriously. “I applaud the fact that the new housing minister expresses enthusiasm to tackle the housing crisis,” he said in a statement. “However, it’s troubling that failed ‘market solutions’ continue to take precedence over increased funding for social housing.” Other recommendations include investing in crisis housing services and raising the rate of working age payments and formally recognising housing as a human right. The debate moves to the federation chamber. We will hear more on that issue later today when domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner Micaela Cronin tables her inaugural report on the national plan to end violence against women and children. Sussan Ley: We have seen strides that have taken us forward and promoted gender equality and respect for relationships in closing the gender pay gap. These initiatives are at risk. We risk a regression as social media influencers peddle misogyny for likes and promote gender stereotyping for followers. We risk a regression as social media companies profit off algorithms that are conditioning our kids with toxic views, we risk a regression as violent pornography and concerning practices like choking are normalised and damaging the brains of our next generation. We risk a regression as the stress of economic strain is generating new cycles of domestic violence, and new forms of abuse. And we know that the economic pain will continue with difficult days to continue. ‘These women had dreams’: Sussan Ley vows to work with Labor on stopping violence against women The domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner Micaela Cronin will address the National Press Club on this issue later today. Justine Elliot’s statement was delivered ahead of that address. The deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley says she will be there and stands ready to work with the government on addressing the issue. Elliot, and Ley, have both made a point of reading the names of the women who have been killed by violence aloud in the parliament. Ley: These women had dreams. They had hopes and aspirations for their lives. They had friends. They were sisters and mothers. They were loved by so many in our communities who we have watched. These are devastating statistics, and each one was a life lost, leaving a hole in the lives of their families, their friends, their communities and our nation. Elliot says attitudes on gender-based violence are improving but we ‘have to do more’ Justine Elliot continues: I’ve heard of the countless ways in which perpetrators inflict their violence on women they say they love. With many perpetrators, their violence may not be physical, but it is planned, orchestrated and in every sense, malicious. The problem of violence against women and children is complex. And in a year where too many women have been killed by violent men, it’s difficult to reconcile that there has been progress towards ending this national crisis. But when we look at the long-term picture, we can see significant improvements in community attitudes that reject and challenge this violence. More men and women stand with us today than ever before. I am proud to be part of a government that is taking action on this issue. The Albanese Labor government is absolutely committed to achieving our shared vision of ending violence against women and children in one generation. We’re taking action today, here and now. All of us have to do more – all of us must do better. Together we can, we must and we will. The time is now. ‘For too many women, home is the most dangerous place’ The assistant minister for the prevention of family violence, Justine Elliot is making a ‘statement on a significant matter’ in the house. It is on gender-based violence. Elliot: Growing up, so many young girls and women have always had to think and act differently. It may mean walking on the other side of the street, so you avoid walking past someone bigger than you. If you’re on the bus, it may mean turning the volume down on your music so you can hear behind you. You may decide to leave work before it gets dark or catch a taxi or ride-share – making sure you let someone know – just in case. And when you get home, you look behind you before opening the door, which you then promptly lock. For some women, Mr Speaker, once they get home and lock the door, they still aren’t safe. For too many women, home is the most dangerous place. You see Mr Speaker; the life of a woman is different. We’ve had to see, think and act differently throughout our entire lives - out of fear of violence. Fear of violence should not be a normal nor accepted part of womanhood. The parliament will sit from 9am this morning. We’ll take you into the house shortly after the prayers for the opening gambit. When will the Coalition reveal cost of nuclear plan? ‘In good time’ Late yesterday, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor spoke to 2GB, where he was asked about the Coalition’s nuclear plan (remember that?). Q: So when will we know how much your plan will cost? Taylor: Well, I’ve already answered that question – in good time. Q: In good time’s not an answer though, Angus! Taylor: Well, it is. It’ll be before the election, I can assure you of that. The minister for skills and training, Andrew Giles says 150 “ghost” colleges have been shut down. A ghost college is a registered training provider who has failed to show proof of delivering training for at least a year. An additional 140 vocational training providers have been given warnings – they must resume “quality training” by the end of the year or will face de-registration. Giles: We’ve weeded out and shut down over 150 dormant operators, and 140 more have been given a yellow card. Under our government, there is no place for anyone who seeks to undermine the sector and exploit students. National Farmers’ Federation says farmer confidence has fallen in ‘concerning’ survey The National Farmers’ Federation is holding its leaders’ summit in Canberra today, where it will release the findings from a survey of 1,000 farmers across the nation. The survey looks at confidence, mood – basically the vibe around issues and policies over the last year. In some forward sizzle, the NFF says this year’s results are “concerning” with farmer confidence in the Albanese government’s falling 39% compared to the same time last year. Coalition to introduce bill to ban Cbus Super from receiving money from housing fund The Coalition will be introducing a private members’ bill today to ban the union-linked Cbus Super Fund from receiving any funds from the housing Australia future fund (Haff). The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said the bill would stop the Haff from “making any payments to Cbus or housing related entities financed by Cbus” for the time the CFMEU remains under administration. The Coalition reaffirms our strong opposition to Labor’s Haff. However, we believe taxpayer funds should not be exposed to criminal elements. If Labor is serious about stamping out corruption and protecting taxpayer funds, they will support our Bill. A little later this morning, the independent MP Kylea Tink will host a press conference with Zoe Daniel, Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps to talk about the “increasingly condescending, aggressive, and often misogynistic conduct by Coalition members during parliamentary sittings”. That follows this story from Sarah Basford Canales: ‘I want to look at it closely’: Sussan Ley on MP code of conduct legislation The Liberal party’s deputy leader Sussan Ley was asked about the new IPSC legislation this morning and said she was yet to see it: I’ve been part of the parliamentary leadership taskforce that has been tasked with implementing recommendations from the Jenkins Review. It’s been important work. We’ve established the parliamentary workplace support scheme. I want to give a shout out to that scheme. It’s operating in the building right now for everyone in the building 24/7, and it’s a place you can go for help now. That’s incredibly important, and it’s been incredibly well done as a result of cross-party work. I haven’t seen this legislation. I want to look at it closely. I know that my party room will do the same thing. So we will examine it, and we will see what our response is at that time. Larissa Waters welcomes MP standards commission The Greens’ spokesperson for women, Larissa Waters, has welcomed the introduction of a long-awaited workplace behaviour enforcement body. This morning, Katy Gallagher unveiled the proposed model for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission. Waters said it had been “a long time coming” to stop Parliament House from being a “national shame”. She continued: Both houses of parliament have now endorsed codes of conduct for behaviour, but without an independent body to investigate breaches, those codes have been unenforceable. I am pleased there will now finally be a process to hold MPs accountable for bad behaviour, who have been unsanctionable for far too long. This workplace needs to set the standard rather than be a national shame. We hope that having the codes of conduct enforceable through the IPSC will discourage misconduct, and keep staff and everyone in parliamentary workplaces safe. On the issue of the government’s proposed gambling ads cap (rather than a blanket ban), Katy Gallagher says: Michelle Rowland’s leading that work, working with stakeholders. She’s done a huge amount of work to already impose new rules and regulations around gambling and advertising, and support for gamblers, I should say, through BetStop. So there’s more work to be done. We’re mindful of everyone’s views as we undertake the final decisions around this. There’s no shortage of opinions on right across the board, and we’ll make the decision based on the work that Michelle Rowland has done, and also evidence based and how to protect children. That’s front of our minds as we’re finalising our decisions. Gallagher said Labor has its processes for considering conscience votes. Labor hopes to have MP standards commission up and running in October Katy Gallagher says there is no deal done to pass the legislation as yet, but she does not anticipate too much trouble, given the process to get to this point: We’ve worked very closely with the opposition, as we have with other members of parliament. We’ve addressed concerns where they have arisen, and we’ve been, you know, obviously the shaping of the legislation has been informed by those consultations, but they need to take it through their processes. We’re introducing it today, and then we’ll have some time when the parliament’s not sitting to continue to talk with people, but hopefully we’ll be able to pass this legislation in September, and have it operational in October. Katy Gallagher said she believes the privileges committees (each chamber has its own) is the right place for the reports from the standards commission: These committees are often members of very senior members of respected political parties. They deal with difficult matters all the time, and they haven’t traditionally operated in a partisan way at all. So we believe the privileges committee is the right place for such a senior body to consider a report from the IPSC, and then they will have to make a decision on that and report to the parliament. The minister for women, Katy Gallagher is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast about the IPSC (the Independent Parliamentary Standards Committee). The legislation for the new body will be introduced today. Gallagher says: The way it would work is that we have a body called the parliamentary workplace support service. If someone has a complaint, they work in this building, they can or or in other commonwealth parliamentary workplaces, I should say, because they are around the country, they can make a complaint. If that goes to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission, they can review that complaint, investigate that complaint, if it’s about a member of parliament and it’s a serious complaint that would warrant sanctions of that order … like suspension or a fine or losing your spot on a committee [it would report to the privileges committee] and they would be the ones that would consider appropriate sanctions. Thorpe, Pocock and Daniel back funding campaign for community legal centres Independent senators Lidia Thorpe, David Pocock and the independent MP Zoe Daniel are supporting the campaign that community legal centres have launched for adequate funding. Representatives from more than 160 community legal centres are launching the national campaign, calling for their services to be funded. At the moment, about 1,000 people a day are turned away. The three demands are: Immediate funding injection of $35m to address the workforce crisis, as recommended by the Independent Review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership Additional $135m each year to sustainably address overall community demand Additional $95m each year to fully meet domestic and family violence demand Sharkie on code of conduct for MPs: ‘We need to be our best selves’ But Rebekha Sharkie does think that a code of conduct for MPs is long overdue. The government will introduce legislation today which includes penalties for MPs and parliament house staff who have been found to have committed wrong doing (just like any other workplace). Sharkie: It absolutely is. Many would remember Cathy McGowan taking a code of conduct to the parliament and I supported her many years ago when she was the member for Indi with this. And she said at the time we need to be our best selves. Look, I think it’s a great idea. Obviously I want to see the legislation and make sure that it’s not going to be used politicised and used as a weapon but I think most places of work have a code of conduct that all employees adhere to. I don’t think the parliament should be any different. The ABC raises this story from Sarah Basford Canales and asks Rebekha Sharkie whether she has experienced anything like what some of her crossbench colleagues have described. Sharkie says no: I don’t feel that I’m affected by that at all. I have a good relationship with, I think, most members across the parliament and when I ask a question it’s pretty quiet in the chamber. I wouldn’t say it always is. But it’s not always quiet in the chamber for any person asking a question. Gambling ads ‘an issue of morality’: Sharkie As Paul Karp reported yesterday, the independent MP Rebekha Sharkie is one of the MPs pushing for the major parties to be allowed a conscience vote on the forthcoming Labor gambling legislation. Why? She told the ABC this morning: The Murphy report called for a full ban. That’s the expectation of many members of parliament, both the opposition and government said and the crossbench, but many have said to me that they’re wrestling with their conscience on the idea that there would only be a partial ban and many people see this issue closely tied to their faith, an issue of morality. So it would appear to me and also to Andrew Wilkie that, you know, a straightforward position would be to allow a conscience vote and in my time in the Parliament, we’ve had four conscience votes. I think it would naturally fit for the parameters an issue that sits within their soul. Australian Medical Association urges full ban on gambling ads The Australian Medical Association has joined the increasingly loud voices urging the government to follow through with a full ban on gambling ads. The AMA president, Prof Steve Robson, said reports of a partial ban, with caps, was “extremely disappointing”. Anything less than a comprehensive ban on online gambling advertising will do nothing to protect Australians falling into the grips of gambling addiction,” Robson said. If you give these betting companies any kind of wriggle room with advertisements, they will exploit it. We saw this with the vaping industry, and similar scenes are now playing out with gambling. A very big thank you to Martin for starting us off today on this busy morning. You have Amy Remeikis with you now for most of the day. Why Dutton wants to close the door to Gazan refugees – Full Story podcast Just three days after Asio chief Mike Burgess asked politicians to watch their words about the Middle East, Peter Dutton escalated his rhetoric against Palestinians fleeing Gaza. Political editor Karen Middleton and community affairs reporter Mostafa Rachwani tell Tamsin Rose about the political calculations behind the opposition leader’s latest line of attack. You can listen here: What are the facts about the Gaza refugees? The opposition has ratcheted up its criticism of the government’s approach to Palestinians seeking to come to Australia from the Gaza war zone. Yesterday, Coalition senator James Paterson said the Albanese government had to “urgently explain” its position. He claimed allies including Five Eyes members the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand had taken “a much more cautious approach”, accepting “only a fraction” of Australia’s intake. But what are the facts about the Gaza refugees? Kate Lyons has prepreared this explainer to get to the bottom of it. The Albanese government has given the green light to the first stages of “Australia’s biggest renewable energy project ever” – Sun Cable’s Australia-Asia Power Link in the Northern Territory outback. Announced more than six years ago, Sun Cable’s $30bn-plus development is one of the world’s most ambitious renewable energy proposals. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government had approved the construction of 4-gigawatts of solar farm on a former pastoral station between Elliot and Tennant Creek, an 800km transmission line to Darwin and an underwater cable to the edge of Australia’s commonwealth waters. She said the approved project would enable a green manufacturing sector, produce electricity for the NT capital and allow potential export to Singapore via what the company says would be 4,300km of subsea cables. In a statement late on Tuesday, Plibersek said the approval comes with strict conditions to protect nature, including avoiding the greater bilby and critical habitat for wildlife. This massive project is a generation-defining piece of infrastructure. It will be the largest solar precinct in the world, and heralds Australia as the world leader in green energy. Sun Cable Australia’s managing director, Cameron Garnsworthy, said it was a “landmark moment in the project’s journey”. He said the company aimed to make a final investment decision by 2027. SunCable went into voluntary administration in early 2023 after the billionaire investors Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest fell out over its direction. A consortium led by Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and including Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners eventually took on the company’s assets. How the Independent Parliamentary Standards Body will work In documents seen by Guardian Australia, complaints made to the new body will be assessed by a single commissioner to determine whether an investigation should commence. For politicians, three commissioners would then decide on whether the breach occurred and could impose mandatory training, a behaviour agreement or other sanctions, such as fines. Serious misconduct could be referred to the privileges committee for further consideration. For staffers accused of misconduct, a single commissioner would investigate the matter and make a recommendation to their boss. The body will be given information-gathering powers and those found to have breached the codes will have the option of an internal review. The IPSC will not be able to investigate anonymous complaints. The investigative body will also be able to consider allegations made against others working in Parliament House, including privately employed staff, such as journalists and contractors. If misconduct is found to have occurred, the body could make recommendations to their employer or to the presiding officers to remove or restrict their access to Parliament House. We’ll update you further once we learn more. Labor to release model for body to enforce parliamentary behaviour standards and codes The Albanese government will today release its long-awaited model for a body with the power to sanction misbehaving federal politicians. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Body (IPSC) will enforce behaviour standards and codes applying to all federal politicians and staffers, adopted by parliament in February 2023 following the recommendations in the landmark Set the Standard report. The body, however, will not be able to investigate any comments made under parliamentary privilege meaning any wars of words between politicians in the chamber, such as those during question time, would most likely be exempt. The bill itself will amend the interim Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, a HR-like body for staffers and politicians made permanent last year. A cross-parliamentary group, known as the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, has been negotiating the details of the body since early 2022. The federal government had envisioned the standards body’s doors would be opened by 1 October 2024 after a number of delays but it will still need to pass both houses and avoid being referred to a committee for further inquiry. The behaviour and standards codes the IPSC will be tasked with enforcing include a commitment to treating all with “integrity, dignity, safety and mutual respect” and a total ban on bullying and harassment, sexual harassment and assault, and discrimination in all forms. Greens demand coalmine ban in FMIA negotiations The Greens have urged the Albanese government to negotiate in “good faith” over its $22.7bn ambitions to make Australia a renewable energy superpower. Labor’s policy, known as Future Made in Australia (FMIA), is the county’s answer to the US’s inflation reduction act, with most of funding offered as subsidies to renewable industry to power the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. The Greens, who are in the balance of power in the Senate, have the following demands: No new coal and gas mines as part of FMIA funding. Redirect $1.5bn for the Middle Arm project to clean energy. Guarantees on public ownership and investment on any returns. Domestic critical minerals reserves and processing requirements. Prioritising First Nations economic justice and sovereignty in project and funding The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said: Public ownership and reservation of critical resources will help avoid the mistakes of the previous mining and gas booms. We are ready to negotiate with the government in good faith over these bills, but Labor needs to be ready to shift as well. Labor must drop its insistence on opening more coal and gas mines and letting big corporations export our wealth and jobs overseas while leaving Australia to face claims of shortages.” Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and these are some of the top stories this morning. Teal MPs have called time on poor question time behaviour, claiming performances by the opposition during recent sitting weeks have been “condescending”, “aggressive” and “often misogynistic”. Data shows Coalition MPs are far and away more likely to be ejected from the chamber. It follows Peter Dutton’s challenge to the government’s visa approval process and some incendiary scenes in parliament, but what are the facts about Gaza refugees? The NSW Liberals have decided not to take legal action against the state’s electoral commission over the party’s council election bungle, but the party could face a legal battle with candidates furious at being unable to run. The NSW Liberal party has been in crisis mode since it failed to submit nomination forms for one-in-three endorsed candidates for upcoming local government elections. It sought legal counsel about a possible lawsuit against the electoral commission but have thought better of it. And we also have news that the Albanese government has given the green light to the first stages of “Australia’s biggest renewable energy project ever” – Sun Cable’s Australia-Asia Power Link in the Northern Territory outback.

                    "headline": "TechScape: Why I can’t stop writing about Elon Musk",
                    "bodyText": "“I hope I don’t have to cover Elon Musk again for a while,” I thought last week after I sent TechScape to readers. Then I got a message from the news editor. “Can you keep an eye on Elon Musk’s Twitter feed this week?” I ended up doing a close-reading of the world’s most powerful posting addict, and my brain turned to liquid and trickled out of my ears: His shortest overnight break, on Saturday night, saw him logging off after retweeting a meme comparing London’s Metropolitan police force to the Nazi SS, before bounding back online four and a half hours later to retweet a crypto influencer complaining about jail terms for Britons attending protests. But somehow I was still surprised by what I found. I knew the rough contours of Musk’s internet presence from years of covering him: a three-way split between shilling his real businesses, Tesla and SpaceX; eager reposting of bargain-basement nerd humour; and increasingly rightwing political agitation. Following Musk in real-time, though, revealed the ways his chaotic mode has been warped by his shift to the right. His promotion of Tesla is increasingly inflected in culture war terms, with the Cybertruck in particular promoted with language that makes it sound like buying one will help defeat the Democrats in the US presidential election this November. The bargain-basement nerd humour mentioned above is tinged with an anger at the world for not thinking he’s the coolest person in it. And the rightwing political agitation is increasingly extreme. Musk’s involvement in the disorder in the UK seems to have pushed him further into the arms of the far right than ever before. This month has seen him tweet at Lauren Southern for the first time, a far-right Canadian internet personality who is most famous in the UK for earning a visa ban from Theresa May’s government over her Islamophobia. More than just tweet: he also supports her financially, sending around £5 a month through Twitter’s subscription feature. Then there was the headline-grabbing retweet of Britain First’s co-leader. On its own, it could have been chalked up to Musk not knowing the pond in which he was swimming; two weeks on, the pattern is more clear. These are his people, now. Well, that’s OK then A neat example of the difference between scientific press releases and scientific papers, today from the AI world. The press release, from the University of Bath: AI poses no existential threat to humanity – new study finds. LLMs have a superficial ability to follow instructions and excel at proficiency in language, however, they have no potential to master new skills without explicit instruction. This means they remain inherently controllable, predictable and safe. This means they remain inherently controllable, predictable and safe. The paper, from Lu et al: Large language models, comprising billions of parameters and pre-trained on extensive web-scale corpora, have been claimed to acquire certain capabilities without having been specifically trained on them … We present a novel theory that explains emergent abilities, taking into account their potential confounding factors, and rigorously substantiate this theory through over 1,000 experiments. Our findings suggest that purported emergent abilities are not truly emergent, but result from a combination of in-context learning, model memory, and linguistic knowledge. Our work is a foundational step in explaining language model performance, providing a template for their efficient use and clarifying the paradox of their ability to excel in some instances while faltering in others. Thus, we demonstrate that their capabilities should not be overestimated. The press release version of this story has gone viral, for predictable reasons: everyone likes seeing Silicon Valley titans punctured, and AI existential risk has become a divisive topic in recent years. But the paper is several steps short of the claim the university’s press office wants to make about it. Which is a shame, because what the paper does show is interesting and important anyway. There is lots of focus on so-called “emergent” abilities with frontier models: tasks and capabilities that didn’t exist in the training data but which the AI system demonstrates in practice. Those emergent abilities are concerning to people who worry about existential risk, because they suggest that AI safety is harder to guarantee than we’d like. If an AI can do something it’s not been trained to do, then there’s no easy way to guarantee a future AI system is safe: you can leave things out of the training data but it might work out how to do them anyway. The paper demonstrates that, at least in some situations, those emergent abilities are nothing of the sort. Instead, they’re an outcome of what happens when you take an LLM like GPT and hammer it into the shape of a chatbot, before asking it to solve problems in the form of a question-and-answer conversation. That process, the paper suggests, means the chatbot can’t ever truly be given “zero-shot” questions, where it has no prior training: the art of prompting ChatGPT is inherently one of teaching it a bit about what form the answer should take. It’s an interesting finding! Not quite one that proves the AI apocalypse is impossible, but – if you want some good news – one that suggests it’s unlikely to happen tomorrow. Training pains Nvidia scraped YouTube to train its AI systems. Now that’s coming back to bite: A federal lawsuit alleges that Nvidia, which focuses on designing chips for AI, took YouTube creator David Millette’s videos for its AI-training work. The suit charges Nvidia with “unjust enrichment and unfair competition” and seeks class action status to include other YouTube content creators with similar claims. Nvidia unlawfully ‘scraped’ YouTube videos to train its Cosmos AI software, according to the suit, filed Wednesday in the Northern District of California. Nvidia used software on commercial servers to evade YouTube’s detection to download ‘approximately 80 years’ worth of video content per day’, the lawsuit says, citing an Aug 5 404 media report. This lawsuit is unusual in the AI world if for no other reason than the fact that Nvidia was slightly taciturn about its sources of training data. Most AI companies that have faced lawsuits have been proudly open about their disregard for copyright limitations. Take Stable Diffusion, which sourced its training data to the open-source LAION dataset. Well: [Judge] Orrick found the artists had reasonably argued that the companies violate their rights by illegally storing work and that Stable Diffusion, the AI image generator in question, may have been built ‘to a significant extent on copyrighted works’ and was ‘created to facilitate that infringement by design’. Of course, not every AI company plays on an even field here. Google has a unique advantage: everyone gives it consent to train its AI on their material. Why? Because otherwise you get booted off search entirely: Many site owners say they can’t afford to block Google’s AI from summarising their content. That’s because the Google tool that sifts through web content to come up with its AI answers is the same one that keeps track of web pages for search results, according to publishers. Blocking Alphabet Inc’s Google the way sites have blocked some of its AI competitors would also hamper a site’s ability to be discovered online. Ask me anything One more, self-indulgent, note.

                    "headline": "AI could help identify toddlers who may be autistic, researchers say",
                    "bodyText": "Artificial intelligence may help experts identify toddlers who may be autistic, researchers have said after developing a screening system they say has an accuracy of about 80% for children under the age of two. The researchers say their approach, which is based on a type of AI called machine learning, could bring benefits. Dr Kristiina Tammimies, a co-author of the study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said: “Using [the] AI model, it can be possible to use available information and earlier identify individuals with elevated likelihood for autism so that they can get earlier diagnosis and help.” But, she added: “I want to stress that the algorithm cannot diagnose autism as this should [still] be done with gold standard clinical methods.” It is not the first time researchers have attempted to harness AI to screen for autism. Among other studies scientists have previously used such technology together with retinal scans of children. Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, Tammimies and colleagues report how they harnessed data from a US research initiative called the Spark study encompassing information from 15,330 children with a diagnosis of autism and 15,330 without. The team describe how they focused on 28 measures that could be easily obtained before children are 24 months old, based on parent-reported information from medical and background questionnaires, such as age at first smile. They then created machine learning models that looked for different patterns in combinations of these features among autistic and non-autistic children. After using the data to build, tune and test four different models, the team picked the most promising one, and tested it on a further dataset of 11,936 participants for whom data on the same features was available. In total 10,476 of these participants had an autism diagnosis. The results reveal that, overall, the model correctly identified 9,417 (78.9%) participants with or without autism spectrum disorder, with the accuracy 78.5% for children aged up to two years old, 84.2% for those aged two to four and 79.2% for those aged four to 10. A further test using another set of data encompassing 2,854 autistic individuals revealed the model correctly identified 68% with such a diagnosis. Tammimies said: “This data set was another research cohort with having families with only one child with autism and some of the parameters were missing, thus the performance was a bit lower showing that we need to do some more development.” The researchers said the measures that appeared to be most significant in general when it came to the model’s predictions included problems with eating foods, age at first construction of longer sentences, age at achieving potty training, and age at first smile. The team added that an additional analysis, comparing participants the model correctly identified as being autistic and those incorrectly identified as non-autistic, suggested the model tended to identify autism in individuals with more severe symptoms and more general developmental issues. However some experts urged caution, noting the ability for the model to correctly identify non-autistic people was only 80%, meaning 20% would have been erroneously flagged as possibly autistic. They also noted that pushing for an early diagnosis could be problematic. Prof Ginny Russell of the University of Exeter said that was because it was hard to tell which toddlers might have a very serious impairment and who would “catch up” despite a slow start. “My recommendation is below [two years] is too early to start applying psychiatric labels based on a few signifiers like eating behaviour,” she said."

                    "bodyText": "Tourism has never had a great reputation, given that the very word “tourist” is pejorative. At best, it suggests someone whose interest is superficial and whose understanding of a place is nonexistent. What’s the first thing you think, when you hear the phrase, “They’re a bit of a tourist”? You think, that person is annoying. But the word’s reputation has plummeted further in recent years. Anti-tourism movements are springing up across the world: that might look like a protest march, as in Barcelona, where one placard bluntly pleaded “Tourists go home; you are not welcome here”. It might look like a visitor fee, as Venice introduced this year, or it might look like the mayor of Amsterdam simply closing the cruise ship terminal, as she did last year. Part of this is about sheer volume: the number of people crossing an international border as tourists (rather than displaced people or migrants) in 2023 was 1.3 billion, which is not only a complete bounceback post-Covid, but an almost 25-fold increase since the 1950s. Driven not only by flights becoming ever more affordable, but the online convenience of booking travel – from the launch of last-minute flight and hotel brokers in the late 90s, to Airbnb in the late 00s, followed by Google Flights and Trips – everything about travel has become easier and cheaper. But the difficulties and costs still exist, they’re just paid elsewhere. Tourism accounts for just over 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. Short-term holiday rentals distort housing markets until the locals are spending summer months living in car parks – as has happened in Ibiza. And that’s just the aggregate impact of tourism, before any of us have arrived and started doing anything. Dubrovnik in Croatia has new rules about not jumping in fountains or climbing on statues and not walking around shirtless. Amsterdam launched a “stay away” advertising campaign (specifically aimed at the British, shamingly). Budapest, Munich, Dusseldorf and Prague all banned “beer-bikes”, those 17-seat charabancs where stag parties pedal their way to oblivion. Split has introduced specific fines for vomiting and urinating in public (again, those signs are in English). The Italian culture minister, meanwhile, has simply had enough of people defacing the Colosseum. When you look at anti-tourism movements as a whole, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that travel is one of those nice things we no longer deserve. But into that sorry picture steps the travel journalist Paige McClanahan with her book The New Tourist. We can still travel, she says, and more than that, it’s important that we do; we just have to get a lot better at it. The old kind of tourist, she writes, is “a pure consumer who sees the people and places he encounters when he travels as nothing more than a means to some self-serving end: an item crossed off a bucket list, a fun shot for his Instagram grid, one more thing to brag about to his peers”. The new tourist, by contrast, is humbled by the unfamiliar, not unsettled by it, she “embraces the chance to encounter people whose backgrounds are very different to her own, and to learn from cultures or religions that she might otherwise fear or regard with contempt”. Maybe that doesn’t sound groundbreaking – in brief, when you’re away, try being your best self – but it cuts to the heart of a book that is part a modern history of international travel, part manifesto for it. Fundamentally, McClanahan sees travel as a social good. “When we think about the challenges humanity is going to face in the years and decades to come, whether it’s another pandemic, runaway AI or catastrophic climate change, each of these crises is completely ignorant of national borders,” she says. “Should we all just sit at home, is that going to prepare us? No, we need high-quality, meaningful interactions that are going to shift our perspectives and deepen our understanding of what it means to be a human being in such an interconnected world.” However, we can’t just carry on as we are. The term “overtourism” was popularised in 2016 by Skift, a travel news outlet, with Iceland as its poster child. After the country’s financial crash of the late 00s, the income from tourism became hugely important, partly as a way of paying off a massive IMF loan. But visitors come at a cost, whether it’s the destruction of moss and grassland from the footfall, or the new pressure on the road infrastructure when an island with a population of about 350,000 began seeing more than 2 million tourists by the end of 2017. McClanahan interviewed the former first lady of Iceland, Eliza Reid, for her book, who told her that she and her partner, the then president, Guðni Jóhannesson, walked through the middle of Reykjavik on a summer day in 2017. “And nobody recognised him, because there were no Icelanders there. It was all tourists.” That sense of heavily visited areas being denatured, left unrecognisable when the resident:visitor ratio is out of whack, was compounded after the pandemic. It wasn’t so much that tourists brought Covid (although they did); rather, that the international travel bans made people realise, as they did in other places such as Hawaii, “just how much they had been sacrificing for tourists for so long”, McClanahan says. It was assumed that people in tourism-heavy areas in Hawaii would be pining for travel bans to be lifted after so much income was lost during the pandemic, but the peace and quiet turned out to be much more valuable in some places. In polls, native Hawaiian community leaders and young people were the least likely to agree that tourism did more good than harm. At the end of a Hawaii tourism conference McClanahan attended, one participant stood up and said: “‘Tourism is colonialism. Tourists need to go home now,’” McClanahan remembers. “And I thought, ‘That’s my dude.’” It could be an Instagram post perpetuating colonial stereotypes (she is unflinchingly self-critical about this: “For example, Paige standing alone in a Cambodian ruin,” she cites as an example) or it could be visitor demand simply remaking the culture into a theme park, boom boxes and novelty penny farthings where real life should be happening. I suggest to McClanahan that, from Hawaii to Mallorca, what residents are rebelling against is as much late capitalism as it is tourists: historically, the inconvenience of having vastly more visitors a year than there are residents has been offset by what this does for the local economy. But, if the fruits, one way or another, aren’t evenly distributed – maybe the model drives a low-wage culture, maybe intermediaries such as cruise companies or Airbnb cream off the profit – that contract is bust and resentment creeps in on both sides. I remember this from going to Tulum in Mexico two years ago. It’s a chic tourist hotspot where a cab driver would happily relieve you of $30 to go 200 metres down the road. I felt pretty sour about that, but he probably felt pretty sour about me spending eight times as much on a single plate of food as the hourly rate of the person who served it to me. McClanahan agrees that “daytrippers to Venice, people coming off a cruise to buy a postcard and an ice-cream and then leave” might fit into that picture, but it’s possible to travel while staying “socially conscious and socially aware”: spend more time in a place, not at the height of the season, and spend money in local businesses. The first chapter of The New Tourist goes back to how we got here: 50 years ago, when newlyweds Tony and Maureen Wheeler set off from the south of England to drive to India. They weren’t the first to try the hippy trail, but they were the first to launch a publishing empire off the back of it: Lonely Planet. Many of us who took our first trips as adults holding one of these guides will remember the sensibility of them: it was all about budget travel, getting in and out of a place on a fiver. The Wheelers changed the terms of tourism entirely – the true traveller didn’t waltz in like Lady Muck, paying top dollar for everything. This new kind of tourist liked to be called a “traveller” and went to out-of-the-way places, craving the authenticity of the locals’ experience, not luxury. But this had its downsides, namely that these “travellers” had the same footprint but a lot less money. No offence – and this is my opinion, not McClanahan’s – the Wheelers made an absolute fortune off performative non-materialism and lauded being “off the beaten track”, while beating every track so hard you could see the tracks from space. Lonely Planet guides, by the turn of this century, had become more about the high end, but there is a broader tension, which McClanahan exemplifies with Bhutan – where you pay a really sizeable visitor sustainable development tax of $100 a person every day – versus Nepal, the “backpacker’s superhighway”. “In Bhutan,” she says, “you had to come with an organised tour and had to be led by a local tour guide. They were very explicitly going for lower volume, higher quality tourism.” She felt plugged in to Bhutan, “saw villages that felt untouched” (tourism in Bhutan has existed, in tiny numbers, since 1974); Nepal, heaving with visitors, didn’t come close, “although the landscapes were beautiful, of course”. It would be crude, though, to make that into a creed that you should only travel if you’re loaded. Maybe, rather, it means start by going to places where they want you. “For every Barcelona or Venice pushing back against tourism,” McClanahan says, “there are so many other places that are working as hard as they can to attract tourists.” Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Rwanda and Japan all have active state programmes to increase tourist numbers. McClanahan’s first law of new tourism is a simple one: “Travel to fewer places, and spend longer there. Understand that this might be the only time in your life that you have the opportunity to see this landscape, this wildlife, to come and meet these people.” Travel, as she describes it, comes with a “tinge of nostalgia, a bitter-sweetness” even while you’re doing it. “Part of its bliss is that you may never come back, and even if you do, you will never re-experience this moment.” But don’t go looking for bitter-sweetness: McClanahan talks about “last chance” tourism – people rushing to Victoria Falls, the Great Barrier Reef, Venice – which are all at risk, respectively from drought; marine debris and rising sea temperatures; and rising sea levels – looking for the last perfect selfie in front of the extremities of a dying planet. It sounds so self-defeating and, more than that, depressing, that it’s impossible to imagine people still doing that. But we can see that people are still doing that. And while many countries are entering into explicit contracts with visitors to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, not all of these are particularly helpful. In Palau in the western pacific, you will receive a pledge stamp in your passport that will give you special access to places if you buy reef-safe sunscreen. In Denmark, there’s a trial initiative called Copenpay, in which tourists might get a free boat trip for picking up litter, or a free drink if you cycle to a bar instead of driving. It’s a creative way to connect tourists to the place they’re in, but it all underlines how hard it is to truly mitigate your carbon footprint as a tourist: cycling through Copenhagen won’t make a lot of difference if you arrived there by plane. McClanahan is more plausible than most tech-optimists on the aviation front. “The technology for carbon-free travel already exists,” she says. “It’s not being deployed at anything like the scale needed, and we all need to educate ourselves, as consumers and as voters, about the transformation and the speed that we need. Whether it’s through electric flight, whether it’s hydrogen-powered flight, whether it’s through a hydrocarbon fuel that is made from carbon dioxide, extracted from the atmosphere, this technology exists, these planes have flown. It’s a question of being able to do it at the scale required to make an actual impact on the atmosphere.” On the climate crisis, as with all the ethical challenges tourism faces, McClahanan urges us to consider the counter-factual. There isn’t a simple fix, such as “stop doing it”. As the old TomTom satnav adverts used to say, you’re not in traffic, you are traffic. If you’ve travelled somewhere where you can see overtourism, you’re an overtourist. Yet “there’s a wonderful amount of humility that we gain from getting out of our comfort zone”, McClanahan says. “We just need to learn to do it differently.” • The New Tourist by Paige McClanahan is out now published by Simon &amp; Schuster. • This article was amended on 19 August 2024 to correctly refer to the mayor of Amsterdam as “she” rather than “he”. The position has been held by Femke Halsema since 2018. It was subsequently amended on 22 August 2024 to clarify that the term “overtourism” was popularised, not coined, in 2016."

                    "bodyText": "Audrey Tang didn’t have the easiest of starts in life. The Taiwanese hacker turned government minister was told at the age of four that she had a 50-50 chance of dying unless she had a major operation to fix a hole in her heart. Her doctor told her she could drop down dead at any moment if she got overexcited – and she had to wait eight more years for the op. This kind of news might bring out someone’s selfish side – if your life is going to be so truncated, live for yourself. Not Tang, though. She was a tiny child with a whopping IQ and a precocious capacity to think. She decided she wanted to learn everything she could and share it with the world. At five, living with her family in Taipei, she started reading prodigiously – mainly classical Chinese literature. Huge tomes. Then she’d recount her own version of the stories to her classmates. “I liked storytelling. When I was seven I’d speak to the entire school about stories I’d learned from a book and retell them in a way I found more interesting.” Did she realise she was super bright back then? She shakes her head. “No, I realised I was super ill.” By six Tang was studying advanced mathematics; at eight she started writing code for video games, using pencil and paper because she didn’t yet own a computer. And whatever she learned, it was with the intention of sharing her knowledge. Before long it became apparent she was a digital genius. Tang, 43, is roughly the same age as the internet (1 January 1983 is considered its birthday). She grew up alongside the world wide web; it was her playmate. In her teens, Tang believed the internet was there to bring her vision to fruition: to democratise knowledge, to make everything accessible, to make the world a better place. But then she saw it changing, being used to spread falsehoods and generate all-powerful companies that made digital capitalism’s founding fathers unfeasibly rich while creating unimagined levels of inequality. “You saw lots of spontaneous self-expression on the early web, expressions of community,” she tells me when we meet on her brief trip to London. “Now the web has been centralised, with a few dominant places where you go to feed your addiction.” Tang is talking of the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and how so many of us live in social media bubbles that reinforce our own prejudices. Social media, she says, has become antisocial media – and she isn’t having any of it. She is determined that digital technology will once again become a force for good – a supreme listening tool for humanity, bringing us together by celebrating difference and uniting over what we have in common. “There are different ways we can have pro-social social media, not antisocial social media, allowing people to be heard and understood, instead of just driving anger and resentment.” Tang spent eight years in Taiwan’s government (the last two as the world’s first minister of digital affairs), putting her theory into practice – and it has worked, from a fantastically efficient response to Covid to countering misinformation about electoral fraud. All of it has been achieved online with the support of citizens eager to share information and ideas. Now the rest of the world is beginning to listen to Audrey Tang. The evening before we meet, she has been talking to Labour bigwigs about how to boost participatory democracy in Britain. Could her philosophy of openness and collaboration be a means of seeing off the populists doing their best to sow global discord? Tang is on a world tour with her new book, Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy. Collaboration is not just a word for her; it’s a way of being. The book, written primarily with American economist E Glen Weyl, is also co-authored by dozens of writers. And behind that, she says, there are hundreds of contributors. Plurality is open-source, meaning anyone can take the ideas in the book and inspect, modify or enhance them (as with Wikipedia). The concept of plurality in technology is collaborating to bridge cultural and social divides. Tang has spent much of her life devising digital tools, with others, to improve access to data in the public domain and to enable us to chat more easily online. This is known as civic hacking. For all the seriousness and complexity of her work, Tang is quietly playful. When she and her community of software programmers first began to organise and agitate for more open government in 2012, they did so by creating parallel, or forked, websites to present information more clearly. They said their aim was to “fork the government” – a deliberate play on words. Tang is a whiz at branding her ideas and has an astonishing vocabulary: she learned English only after German (her family lived in Germany for a while when she was a child), French and Swedish. What is her first language? “JavaScript!” She giggles. “My second and third languages are LOCO and Basic.” Her strategy to counter the Covid pandemic in Taiwan by using digital tools to call on the collective wisdom of its people was based on three principles: “Fast, fair, fun.” To counter fake news, she created a strategy called “humour over rumour”. When it was suggested all the masks made for the pandemic meant Taiwan was running out of toilet paper, a cartoon of premier Lai Ching-te wiping his bottom was produced, captioned “We only have one butt” alongside an explanation of the different sources of toilet paper and masks to reassure people there was enough for everyone. Today, she hands me a copy of Plurality. Inside, she has written “Share and enjoy!!!” It’s very Tang. Sharing and enjoying are central planks of her philosophy. After eight years in government, she has just left politics. Did you achieve what you wanted to? “If that’s a plural you, yes, certainly. You all. The trust level feels very different now. Ten years ago it was at 9%. At the height of counter-pandemic measures, there was 91% of trust in the government. We cherish the 9% [who mistrusted during Covid] because they point out the vulnerabilities, the issues we’ve missed. It’s important to talk to the 9%.” Tang’s priority had always been to make the people more trusted by the government – what true participatory democracy is all about. She believes she has helped achieve this and, in doing so, the government has become more trusted. She says it all goes back to philosopher Laozi’s maxim “to give no trust is to get no trust”. * * * Tang was born into a Taiwan under martial law, to journalist parents. Her mother, Lee Ya-ching, helped develop Taiwan’s first consumer cooperative. In 1987, when Tang was six, Taiwan began its transformation into a democracy. She spent much of her early life visiting hospitals; often when she got upset or excited her heart would beat too fast and she’d faint and wake up in intensive care. How did she feel about her odds of surviving? “I still feel the same way. Every time I go to sleep I think I may not wake up. It felt like a coin flick.” Tang was nevertheless a happy child, until she was put in a class for gifted children. Back then she was a he. “I didn’t behave very boyish,” Tang says. She was the brightest child in a horrifically competitive class, and was bullied from the off, particularly by the second smartest boy who was desperate to usurp Tang. “The idea in his head was that if I died, he would become the first in the class, and his parents would be pleased.” Do you really think they wanted you to die, I ask, shocked. “They expressed that intention,” she says calmly. Things came to a head when she refused to cheat by sharing answers in an exam – one of the few times she hasn’t wanted to share her knowledge, because her fellow pupils were trying to force it out of her. “I was beat really hard. My mum saw a wound and she said maybe it’s best not to go to school for a while.” Tang never went back. Instead she went to a remote non-academic school in the mountains twice a week, studying with tea farmers’ children, and spent the other days attending philosophy clubs. She was never bullied again. Tang read psychology textbooks to try to make sense of the bullying. “I started reading Piaget and Winnicott, who were into child psychology. I wanted to know why my classmates behaved in such a way. My understanding was that they were under tremendous anxiety because the value their parents placed on them was based on relative status. If you build your self-esteem on that, it tends to be shaky and you tend to project outwards the violence, so I was the target of them acting it out.” During adolescence, another difference emerged. “I never developed fully like other boys do. When I was 20 I got a testosterone test and it was that of a 70-year-old man.” Tang had never felt right male. In her 20s, she transitioned. “When I was 24 I had a second puberty after taking oestrogen.” She describes it in a matter-of-fact way, and says she is relaxed about how people refer to her. “My pronouns are any, all, whatever!” Were her parents supportive of her transition? “Yeah, sure!” she says, as if to say: why on earth wouldn’t they be? Tang explains that transitioning is not a big issue in Taiwan, partly, she believes, because the language is not so gender-specific as English. “Mandarin is more flexible. There is no sound difference when you say the three main pronouns.” She doesn’t understand why trans people have become such a source of rage in Britain’s culture wars. “There’s a lack of chill!” She smiles, with consummate chill. Tang is regarded as a trans icon by some, cited as the world’s first non-binary government minister, but again it’s no big deal to her. Tang is proud of the manner in which Taiwan has evolved, and says it’s the perfect place to practise broad listening. “Taiwan actually means the place where the sea and mountains converge. We have 20 different languages and 16 indigenous nations. So many cultures intersect and we don’t have a dominant religion.” She left school at 14 with no qualifications. Her head teacher encouraged her to go to university so she could later do research at Harvard in America. But university seemed pointless to Tang. She was already collaborating online informally with academics from Harvard and Stanford on research, which was all of a piece with her later work. “I was interested in swift trust – why we trust strangers we meet online more readily than face to face and why it’s easier to break such relationships online.” Her understanding of swift trust led to her search for a more profound version of trust online “where we can build places that seem more safe to face uncertainty together”. She went on to work with startups in San Jose in her late teens before returning to Taiwan to work as a free software developer – her software was always distributed under terms that allow users to run it for any purpose and adapt it how they wish. The longer she and her fellow civic hackers worked on free software, the more aware she became of the shortcomings of government digital technology. Tang stresses the difference between civic hacking and cybersecurity hacking, which exposes state secrets. “Civic hacking was never about finding security vulnerabilities; it was always about thinking out of the box to present information or to listen in a way that the traditional way of politics would not. It’s about creating more possibilities.” So she did nothing illegal? “Noooo!” Tang pauses. “But I was somewhat OK in terms of cybersecurity knowledge,” she says with a twinkle. In 2012, she was part of the digital community that created g0v, pronounced Gov Zero. The project ran in parallel with the official government and was there to support it, even if ministers didn’t initially think so. Through g0v, government websites were examined and rewritten to make them more comprehensible and reachable. “We created a parallel web around which citizens could have a normal conversation. For example, when we did the ministry of education dictionary project, we copied everything from the official website, but turned it into something more accessible to people on phones, and integrated other Chinese languages.” The thinking is simple, she says: the more clearly information is displayed, the more people will know, and the easier it becomes to have a conversation about what is and isn’t working in a democracy. Was the government suspicious of what they were doing? “Of course. Because if you’re the ministry, you say all rights reserved, then somebody comes along and takes a copy, flagrantly violating the copyright. What do you do?” What did they do? “Well, they can’t sue all of us. So we were invited to have a conversation and we said we’re just converting official dictionaries which are in the public domain, trying to make it friendlier for kids with mobile phones, and we didn’t derive any commercial benefit from the parallel version of the dictionary we set up.” Through talking, they convinced the government that it was a good thing. After g0v came vTaiwan, an online forum allowing people to discuss and petition on issues of public interest. Once there were 5,000 signatures, the petition was taken to the government to be addressed. What kind of changes has vTaiwan led to? Tang mentions Uber and her face lights up. “All sorts of people took part and lots of different views were heard: people who felt the taxi association union must be respected, people who thought the efficiency and convenience of Uber is very good, people who felt rural areas were underserved.” The one thing most people agreed on is they disliked Uber’s pricing structure. “Uber had this algorithm that said when demand is high you pay drivers more but when it’s low, you pay less. Both passengers and drivers felt this was bad.” The online discussion lasted three weeks. “Then you could see people who strongly disagreed starting to meet in the middle. And see the feelings that bring people together across those differences. And we changed the law.” In October 2016 a number of new laws came into effect, including one stating Uber could not charge less than the standard taxi fare. vTaiwan, using a real-time platform called Polis, has been embraced worldwide as a model for participatory democracy. Earlier this year, Grimsby’s local authority used it for a mass online conversation about what the Lincolnshire port town should look like 10 years from now. In 2014, the Sunflower protest movement was started by students who felt democracy was under threat because the then ruling KMT party was trying to fast-track a major trade deal with China. (Taiwan’s relationship with China is complex – Taiwan is officially known as the Republic of China, China claims it is a province of the People’s Republic of China, whereas the Taiwanese government says it is an independent country.) The students occupied parliament; g0v gave them the tools to livestream the occupation and debates about the deal. “We provided screens so people outside on the street could see what was happening inside and set up websites so people knew what deliberations were going on. The whole country could pay attention to it. Many people arrived at the parliament counter-surrounding the police to ensure the students were not evacuated because we had proof there was no violence involved; that it was peaceful.” After three weeks, the government caved in. “The speaker simply said, ‘You’ve got a point. We agree.’ And that was it; the trade deal went nowhere.” Broad listening, which Tang likes to contrast with broad casting, means listening to those you disagree with. Not surprisingly, it doesn’t always provide results she would favour. In 2017, 26,771 “netizens” signed a petition calling on the government to impose caning as an additional punishment for drunk driving, sex offences and violence against children. What happened next is enlightening. The more people talked, the more the conversation moved away from corporal punishment to how to prevent such crimes in the first place. Participants concluded “To cane or not to cane?” had been the wrong question, something that wouldn’t have emerged from a traditional online petition with a yes/no voting option. After the Sunflower movement, Tang was asked to mentor a government minister. She calls this reverse mentoring and says it’s becoming commonplace. “There is now much more appetite for young people to advise senior leadership on digital or environmental issues.” In 2016, she was made a full-time minister without portfolio, and in 2022 minister of digital affairs. Was it strange when she was invited to become part of the establishment? “No, it’s very logical,” she says. She had always seen herself as helping the government reach the right solutions (even when supporting the Sunflower protest); now she was just doing it in an official capacity. * * * When Covid hit, Taiwan’s remarkable response set it apart from other countries – and Tang was at its heart. Information was crowdsourced rapidly and efficiently. While the World Health Organization was still a month away from declaring a global pandemic, Taiwan had already implemented its mask-making programme. There was pressure on the government to respond effectively to the pandemic after a chaotic response to the 2003 Sars epidemic. From March to May 2020, mask supply was ramped up, from 2m to 20m items a day, but masks had to be rationed in the short term. It led to huge queues outside stores, which posed a risk of contagion. This is when Tang and her civic hacking community came to the rescue. They built a series of real-time mask maps, showing stores where they were available and where they had run out. The maps were open-source, so anybody could contribute and they were constantly updated. This transformed the public’s response to the outbreak. By June 2020 more than 10 million people out of a population of 23.5 million had used the mask maps. At this point there had already been more than seven years of information sharing between the government and the public. Trust was high which meant an efficient mass contact tracing programme could be introduced using QR codes. Tang ensured privacy was protected as much as possible by decentralising data, deleting it after 28 days and keeping it out of prosecutors’ hands. Taiwan never went into a full lockdown and, despite its proximity to China, there were only seven deaths from Covid-19 in 2020. This figure rose dramatically after a breakout among airline staff, but by April 2024, it still compared favourably with Britain – 19,005 deaths in Taiwan, 232,112 in the UK, which has a population only three times bigger. * * * Tang’s techniques are also a powerful tool to fight misinformation. When earlier this year Taiwan was accused of rigging elections – assumed by many to be spread on social media by agents of China – she was ready. “We prebunked the attacks by inviting people to film the counting – it’s paper ballot only – so we could show what happened.” When the public effectively become citizen journalists, “you don’t automatically say people are rigging the election. You instead ask who do I trust?” I ask Tang what the Chinese government thinks of her. “Well, I’m not under sanction. Many people in China pay attention to the work we’ve been doing because they are trying out this kind of deliberative conversational democracy.” But she says it’s safer for her to make digital rather than physical visits to China, not least because she has been involved in national security conversations during her time in government. Does she think AI poses a threat to world stability? “If you mean authoritarian intelligence, of course it’s something to be worried about. AI is intelligence, but not in the same way as our brain is. It’s intelligence that can produce coherent language with no lived experience.” The important thing to remember, she says, is that AI is there to serve us, not vice versa. Tang distinguishes between artificial general intelligence (creating a machine smarter than humans) and augmented collective intelligence (using these technologies to enhance human decision-making). “If AI is used in an authoritarian way, we have to demand it is steered into something more assisting. We need to recognise our power as people to say no or yes to technology.” Tang calls herself a conservative anarchist. “Anarchism to me means voluntary cooperation rather than resorting to coercion. And conservative means respecting the traditions of the 20 languages and 16 nations of Taiwan, but more generally respecting the institutional norms, no matter where you are, and innovating within them instead of destroying them.” Now, her work in politics is done – for the time being. In June, she resigned from government – peacefully and collaboratively, of course – to focus on taking her vision to a wider audience. She wants us all to start listening, talking, bearing witness to truths, exposing non-truths and changing the world for the better. Her dream is an open-source world without physical borders where we all share data and information for the common good. Taiwan has adopted her philosophy so wholeheartedly that it now offers residency to anybody who has made open-source contributions on the internet for eight years. As Tang talks, the song Imagine starts playing in my head: “You may say I’m a dreamer / But I’m not the only one / I hope someday you’ll join us / And the world will be as one.” I tell her I think she’s got a touch of the John Lennons about her. She smiles and nods. “It’s easy if you try,” she says. • Plurality by Audrey Tang, E Glen Weyl and others is available to download at plurality.net"

                    "bodyText": "Elon Musk doesn’t stop tweeting. Over just seven days last week, he made nearly 650 posts to the social network he bought in November 2022 and half-heartedly rebranded as X. In addition, he spent nearly three hours battling through technical problems he would later attribute to an unproved hacking attack in order to host a “conversation” with Donald Trump, as well as livestreaming himself playing a couple of hours of Blizzard’s swords-and-sorcery game Diablo IV. The sheer volume of his content would be impressive enough on its own, but even as someone so addicted to posting that he spent more than the budget of the Manhattan project to buy the site, Musk’s consistency is alarming. Over the course of the week of tweets analysed by the Guardian, there was one 90-minute period – between 3.00 and 4.29am local time – when he never posted. Every other half-hour period, night or day, he sent at least one tweet. He posted at 4.41am on a Saturday morning, at 2.30am on a Wednesday night, and at 11pm six days out of seven. In that week, Musk’s longest continuous stretch without tweeting – with a different person, it might be safe to call this “bed time” – was just seven and a half hours, with a lie-in until 8.10am after a late-night posting session. His shortest overnight break, on Saturday night, saw him logging off after retweeting a meme comparing London’s Metropolitan police force to the Nazi SS, before bounding back online four and a half hours later to retweet a crypto influencer complaining about jail terms for Britons attending protests. Wow, Woke, Cool Not all of Musk’s content on X is rich with subtext. The vast majority of his posts are simple, one- or two-word replies to fans, followers and fellow travellers. “Cool,” he replies to a construction influencer posting an AI-generated picture of herself, two minutes before replying “Cool” to a montage of photos of a Tesla Cybertruck driving around North America, one minute after replying “💯” to an AI-generated cartoon of himself pointing at a sign reading: “On this platform, we love criticism.” Sometimes a one-word reply is a mixed blessing: Musk, never one for conventional “netiquette”, will occasionally reply to a message with the “😂” emoji before copying it straight into his own feed without credit. Quite why some get a cherished Musk retweet and others get their post stolen and reposted is unclear. Occasionally, Musk manages to be even more judicious in his praise, particularly from users he appears uneasy about agreeing with too loudly. Posts from End Wokeness about an early-release bill in California, from a Malaysian far-right influencer about a Haitian criminal, and from Libs of TikTok about another bill in California all get a simple “!!” from Musk. Others don’t even get that: a post from the far-right influencer Dom Lucre, whose suspension from the site for posting child abuse imagery Musk personally overturned in 2023, received just a single “!” from the billionaire. Riots and Grok Musk’s agitation over the UK riots seems to have deepened his association with the far right. Over the past week, he has struck up a conversation with the Canadian influencer Lauren Southern, one of three anti-Islam activists who were banned from entering the UK by Theresa May’s government in 2018. As well as chatting about their shared distrust of the media, Musk is now a paid subscriber to her feed, supporting her for £4.92 a month, as he does with more than 160 other users. But there is method to Musk’s apparent madness. The showman that he is, the memes and chats he retweets and reposts are shot through with whatever he wants to promote that day. Sometimes, that is something professional: on Wednesday and Thursday after his AI company, xAI, released the latest version of its Grok large language model, a significant proportion of his posts were sharing quotes and images generated by it. And then there are the riots. In the working week, Musk’s attention wandered from the tension in the UK, but the constant drumbeat of sentencing over the weekend meant he was ready to engage in some mild rabble-rousing. He latched on to the rightwing meme that Keir Starmer was promoting “two tier” policing, constantly drawing attention to the punitive sentences given to rioters while downplaying their involvement in violence. Early on Friday morning, he expanded his criticism to the SNP’s Humza Yousaf, calling the former Scotland first minister “super super racist” and daring him to sue in response. Trump and Tesla On Monday and Tuesday, Musk drew attention to his conversation with Donald Trump: sharing excited posts from fans in the run-up about how many people were likely to tune in and what the two smartest men in the world would discuss and then, after the livestream had ended, reposting aggrieved complaints about how the biased media were not writing positive headlines, and asking for fans to cut down the conversation to a more manageable hour-long highlights reel. For all his friction, another side of Musk comes out when talking about his two largest companies, Tesla and SpaceX. For Tesla in particular, a publicly traded company, he has to be careful what he says. Musk has a fiduciary duty to shareholders, as well as legal obligations about how he can disclose material information. That came to a head when the SEC sued him over a notorious tweet in which he falsely claimed he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. In the ensuing settlement with the regulator, Musk agreed to have a lawyer review all his tweets about Tesla – a deal he has regretted ever since. Yet even after appealing all the way to the supreme court, the deal stands, and Musk’s final chance to get free of the “Twitter sitter” was thrown out in April this year. And so his posts about Tesla are surprisingly measured: shortly after his conversation with Trump, he even posted a long statement that was almost normal, walking back some of his comments about climate change. “To be clear, I do think global warming is real,” he began, before explaining that all he had meant to imply was that even without global warming, high levels of CO2 were dangerous. ‘The Guardian is trash …’ Musk also used the opportunity to take aim at another favoured target: the Guardian. After this paper quoted experts calling it “the dumbest climate conversation of all time”, Musk lashed out at others he followed who shared the article, telling the author Stephen King that the Guardian “cannot be considered as objective” and the entrepreneur Vinod Khosla that “the Guardian is trash”."

                    "bodyText": "This week, a new range of Google smartphones capable of AI image generation has been launched. But for an increasing number of people, the appeal of a less cutting-edge piece of equipment is proving hard to resist: the point-and-shoot camera. The US footballer Megan Rapinoe was seen snapping from the stands at the Paris Olympics. The model Alexa Chung captioned a recent Instagram of her with a camera: “Just another Millennial with a dependency on Snappy Snaps, fighting digital threat with an analogue mode. 😑” A recent glimpse of home life for Rihanna and A$AP Rocky showed a disposable camera lying among the clutter. Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift have both been snapped holding their point-and-shooters. A mixture of early 2000s digital cameras and film cameras, a new generation are also embracing the old technology. This week on Instagram, Myha’la, a star of Industry, which just returned for its third season, posted a selfie holding a point-and-shoot. The Bear star Ayo Edebiri took her own camera to the Emmys. Both are 28. The model Bella Hadid, 27, is a fan. Online, gen Z content creators give cameras the TikTok treatment, seeking to deinfluence people from the latest It-product and offering dupes for expensive models. According to a study earlier this year from Cognitive Market Research, the global film – camera market value is on course to reach £303m by 2030, up from £223.2m in 2023. Kodak has seen demand for film roughly double in the last few years and in July, Harman, Britain’s only manufacturer of 35mm film, announced a multimillion-pound investment in new equipment inspired by growing demand. Tesco, which still has more than 480 photo-printing locations, has seen an uptick in demand for its film processing services with usage up nearly 10% this year. Earlier this summer the Pentax 17 was launched to become “the first film camera to be made by a global camera brand for 21 years”, according to Paul McKay, a co-founder of Analogue Wonderland, which sells film products while seeking to support the growing number of analogue film photographers. Pentax “had to bring engineers back out of retirement … to teach younger engineers. All this because they thought this market was “growing and wasn’t going away”. Shops catering to younger crowds, such as Urban Outfitters, are selling Hello Kitty-themed disposable cameras, Fujifilm Instax Minis in lilac and matcha-green and Lomography cameras. But many of the younger generation are looking for their cameras secondhand. On the secondhand site Depop, searches are up 51% since the start of the year. Sarah Kidwai, 25, has captioned one of her TikToks attempting to deinfluence viewers from buying the digital Canon G7 X: “You don’t need to spend $700 on a camera, buy one from eBay to slay.” Part of the appeal of film point-and-shoot cameras, as opposed to digital ones, is the look of the photographs. Emily Dinsdale, Dazed magazine’s arts and photography editor, described the aesthetic as romantic. “Even the mistakes are romantic – the light leaks on the first few frames of a new roll, red-eye and grain.” On a feed full of glossy pictures, analogue demands attention. The images resulting from real film cameras will often have “that lovely nostalgic grainy film quality”, full of charm and imperfections, said Eliza Williams, the editor of Creative Review. For some older users, it is about nostalgia. While, perhaps for younger people in particular, “a certain amount of the attraction to cameras”, according to Williams, “is the idea of them as an object – they are often beautiful things to hold and look very cool in comparison to everyone else holding up their phones”. Cameras tap into the resurgence among gen Z for all things Y2K, from low-slung jeans to velour. “The return of the ‘indie sleaze’ era of the mid to late 00s has been well documented,” said Louise Yems, the strategy director at the creative agency and internet and youth culture specialists Digital Fairy. “During this time, digital cameras were a pretty consistent presence.” She points to the resurfacing of nostalgic tech more broadly across internet culture, citing this video of an 80s party shot on Super 8 going viral as well as “early internet design codes, like Frutiger Aero, [that] are also regaining attention”. The “coolness” of cameras is being harnessed even when no such technology is being used. In the new season of Emily in Paris, released to a cacophony of derision and joy this week, the titular character’s phone case mimics the look of a point-and-shoot camera, cloaking her relentlessly-on smartphone in more analogue trappings. “On a deeper level,” according to Yems, “Gen Z are the first generation with the ability to capture their lives in a totally seamless way. No full memory cards. No hours spent painstakingly transferring your videos or photos from one device to another and then to Myspace or Facebook.” As such, she said, “the process of using a point-and-shoot camera imbues the output with meaning, intent and tactility”. In a survey that McKay carried out this week, the number one reason that people gave for shooting film was that it helped them slow down (66%). “There’s a mindfulness,” he said. “People talk about mental health a lot in this generation when they talk about film photography.” Those choosing to develop their own photos rather than rely on Snappy Snaps will be slowed down further. Dinsdale thinks the uptick in the use of analogue cameras points to a desire for authenticity in an era where deepfakes mean distrust for the visual image. “People trust photographs taken with a film camera more than a digital photo,” she said, “and this feeling will increase as AI-generated images become more prevalent.” She added: “It comes back to the idea of pictures on our phones not being as special as pictures taken on film,” given that “digital photography and smartphones have really changed the currency of images”. For Williams, “at a time when we are all – but particularly gen Z – looking for some release from the pressures of daily life and the addictive qualities of screens, cameras and taking photographs offers a sense of nostalgic pleasure, which feels wholesome and arty while also making you look cool”."

                    "bodyText": "The year is 2224. AI Donald Trump is entering his 50th term. Polar bears have gone the way of the dodo. Happily, Cher remains entirely unchanged. A magazine headline asks: “Should men be allowed to wear shorts?” It’s my belief that the perennial debate over whether men can wear shorts should have been put to bed the moment Paul Mescal was papped in a minuscule O’Neills pair, sending the global happiness index soaring by approximately 10,000 points. Here was a way for a man to wear the equivalent of Diana’s revenge dress – or Beyoncé’s freakum dress, for younger readers – while looking like he’d made no effort whatsoever (leg days at the gym notwithstanding). Earlier this summer, Mescal sported a dressier version of the look at the Gucci menswear show, pairing striped cotton shorts with a blue Oxford shirt, white crew and the brand’s horsebit loafers. Stunning, no notes whatsoever, thank you Paul for your service. Heartbreakingly, we can’t all be Paul Mescal. But it’s my belief that no man should have to swelter through a summer heatwave in a pair of trousers just because … well, I’m never entirely sure of the reasoning. Is it that we associate shorts with childhood, so struggle to take a man in a pair of them seriously? (And if that’s the case, wouldn’t the solution be for more high-powered men to wear shorts?) AA Gill argued that “Men in shorts are silly men. And silly is the very worst thing a man can be.” It slightly reminds me of when Richard Hammond warned men that eating ice-cream made them look gay. Is this the world we want our children to inherit? The men in shorts debate reaches boiling point when it comes to office attire. If you are a high court judge or a funeral director or Keir Starmer, you possibly shouldn’t wear shorts to work. But if your workplace has a more informal dress code – where it wouldn’t be seen as inappropriate to wear a T-shirt, a pair of trainers or a dress without tights – there’s no reason why a well-chosen pair of shorts should inspire any Slack channel side-eye. Public opinion is with me. In 2022 a YouGov poll found that 66% of Britons felt that men’s shorts were appropriate office attire, up from 37% in 2016 (the figure was the same for women). If in doubt, smart tailored shorts paired with a crisp shirt is a safe bet. Similarly, short shorts look less casual when worn with a more generously proportioned top, as with Mescal’s Oxford shirt. Some other tips: if you have chunky thighs, anything slim-fitting will be uncomfortably restrictive, so choose a looser fit or show them off in a five-inch inseam if you dare. If you have short legs, anything that finishes below the knee will shorten them even more. Cargo shorts are no longer the preserve of boomers with bumbags – and pocket details will flatter a skinnier leg. Pair with a similarly utilitarian top, and go for a style that ends just above the knee to avoid looking like a skater, unless you’re comfortable pulling off a more directional, oversized look. Denim cut-offs are a weekend staple, but don’t attempt to fashion a pair by slashing some old jeans - they’ll end up too tight, which is the very last thing you want. Avoid matching shirt and shorts co-ords unless you are applying for Love Island, or want to look like you might be. Most importantly, banish the voice that tells that you shorts are forbidden. To paraphrase Natasha Bedingfield, feel the breeze on your thighs. In a world full of Richard Hammonds, be a Paul Mescal. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

                    "bodyText": "It begins with a phone call. A 10-year-old boy rings, asking for help because his mum’s not coping, she’s been drinking and can’t look after him. A teacher calls, concerned about a student who keeps missing school. A neighbour rings because there’s often shouting next door and the parents of the kids who live there have started smoking ice again. The New South Wales child protection helpline receives hundreds of thousands of calls a year, largely from teachers, doctors and police who suspect children are at risk of abuse and neglect. If a child is in danger it’s designed to be their gateway to help. But at any given moment there can be 10,000 reports stuck in a backlog, according to one caseworker. When the calls to the centralised service are eventually triaged, “like in a hospital”, the reports are referred to Department of Communities and Justice offices. It’s here that a brutal calculation takes place. There might be dozens of children in danger but often DCJ officers can choose only one call to respond to. Will it be the baby born to a single mother with addiction issues, or the teenager who is hurting themselves and running away? The child coming to school with bruises, or not at all? The other reports are marked “closed due to competing priorities”. No one responds to them. As one caseworker says, “You would be horrified if you saw what was closed.” Next, delays mean that even the most serious calls might not be followed up for weeks or months. In that time children may be hurt, experience severe neglect or witness violence that affects them for life. These children are deemed to be at risk of significant harm and, in the 12 months to June 2023, there were more than 112,000 of them. Only a quarter received a home-based safety assessment. The other 84,000 had their cases closed. The NSW auditor general has found that the DCJ did not follow up with any of these children and does not know what happened to them. These are the children failed by a system workers say is in crisis due to underfunding, understaffing and the privatisation of out-of-home care. But even the children who are assessed are often failed, and for the same reasons. The effects can be devastating, caseworkers say, not only for individuals but for society. ‘I can’t actually look at myself in the mirror’ Michael Smart quit the department last year after the removal of a baby from a 19-year-old mother. It was a case that almost broke him. He saw how the system could punish those who had asked for help. The teenager had asked a nurse to help her because she was afraid she wanted to shake her infant. Smart removed “many” children from their families in his more than 20-year career as a caseworker in the state’s northern rivers region but says this was the first time he thought a removal was “completely wrong”. “This young woman, she had no partner,” he says. “She had no family support. She had given birth on her own. And then a few weeks later she tried to seek help. The assessment was that this young woman was capable of looking after this child but needed assistance.” But because she had no family to turn to – both her parents had “significant alcohol issues” – and because the department had no capacity to support her, her baby was taken. “That was the point when I realised that I couldn’t ever go back to the department,” Smart says. “It was the first time I’ve ever been involved in a removal that I felt, ‘I can’t actually look at myself in the mirror.’ It was about poverty. “She’d identified that she was struggling, which is … a strength. She sought advice, she sought help – but she was penalised because she was 19 and she had no one to assist her. But the government weren’t going to help her either.” The state’s child protection system is meant to keep families together as much as possible. It is meant to support those who are struggling, to remove children from danger and to care for them if they can’t go home. It is supposed to help make their homes safe, so that they may be reunited with their families. In the second half of 2023 78 babies were removed from their mothers within their first two weeks of life. That’s nearly three a week. ‘The public would be absolutely mortified’ The northern rivers region is best known for the tourist town of Byron Bay. Its hinterland is home to counterculture and cattle farms; the rolling hills are an almost shocking emerald green. Here the statistics for children in danger are among the worst in NSW: fewer than one in six calls about children at risk of significant harm are assessed. It’s a story replicated across the country: overwhelming demand is met by a desperate shortage of resources. In 2022-23 about one in every 32 Australian children came into contact with child protection services, according to the federal Institute of Health and Welfare, and, as is the case for all child protection statistics, Indigenous children are disproportionately affected. In 2022 the Productivity Commission said response times had lagged to their slowest in more than a decade. In 2023 the federal government added social workers to its list of skills shortages, its record of occupations that employers are struggling to fill. In the northern rivers there are DCJ offices in Tweed Heads, Ballina, Lismore and Grafton. Staff, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to talk to the media, say some offices are so short-staffed they can barely respond to any reports. “If the public sat in on an allocation meeting and realised what we don’t allocate, they would be absolutely mortified,” one caseworker says. “They go through all the reports and they go, ‘OK, we’ve only got one worker who’s got capacity to go out and we’ve got 40 reports, so which one are we going out on?’ “It might be teenagers who are using drugs, leading to psychosis and impacting on their brain development. Domestic violence; you might have children witnessing parents choking, throwing stuff, punching mum in the head, holding the baby yelling and screaming, threatening with a weapon. Mum’s unable to protect their child because they are in survival mode. And, whatever mum does, the male can be coercive and controlling, monitoring where mum is, the routine with the kids, controlling every aspect of what she’s doing.” The caseworker warns that the state is not only letting down its most vulnerable children but also the healthcare system, schools and police. The failure to intervene means children experiencing domestic violence may suffer psychological harm that “perpetuates that cycle of violence”. ‘Wanting to be with your mum’ Jason is a young Aboriginal man from Grafton who understands the cycle of violence. Guardian Australia has decided to give him a pseudonym to protect the privacy of the people in his story. He was removed from his family when he was three after police were called to an “intense episode” of domestic violence. The 27-year-old now has two small children of his own. He admits to having been violent towards their mother on two occasions. He says it’s something he’s ashamed of. He’s sensitive, speaks openly and seems remorseful. But he says he can be quick to anger. He and his siblings went to live with their grandmother but spent stints with foster carers when he says his behaviour became too much for her. They were sent to Port Macquarie, Sydney and towns outside Grafton. When he was a child, Jason says, he was “very violent” whenever he arrived at a carer’s house, breaking windows and destroying valuables so caseworkers would come back to pick him and his sister up. Jason also spent time in residential care, living with other children who had been removed from their families. It felt like prison, he says. “There’s nothing like wanting to be with your mum,” he says, “especially when you are so many kilometres away that you know for a fact that you can’t even speak, see or hug or touch.” Despite being a promising scooter rider who was sponsored by a local company, Jason says he was “fighting heaps” at school. He was impulsive and the way he acted was “pretty bad”. He spent three weeks in prison this year for breaching an apprehended domestic violence order that his mother had taken out against him after he broke one of her windows during an argument. On the later occasion, he says, he got drunk and shouted at her and threw “a couple of items” down the hall. Jason says he still feels angry about what happened to him as a child but he had a “big wake-up call” after his daughter was born. “Everyone in the world has a choice, or choices,” he says. “But being, as I said, impulsive, and I guess being in that framework … has affected me. “There’s not really much programs or rehabilitation for the, I call it post-traumatic stress, from dealing with the feeling of constantly being alone, that you’re constantly being shipped around, and you just don’t feel welcome or comfortable in any sort of area that you are put in.” The family violence cycle For too long, Prof Susan Heward-Belle says, children have been viewed as “collateral damage” or “secondary victims” of domestic violence. “There hasn’t been enough acknowledgment that they have unique experiences of family violence that are their own,” she says. Heward-Belle was a NSW child protection caseworker for many years before completing a PhD in domestic violence and teaching at the University of Sydney. She points to the Australian Child Maltreatment Study, the first to estimate the proportion of mental health conditions caused by childhood abuse and neglect. The study found that between 21% and 41% of mental health conditions could be linked to childhood maltreatment, which Heward-Belle says can have “lifelong impacts” on the way people view themselves. Like all the caseworkers the Guardian spoke to, Heward-Belle points to early intervention as vital for breaking this cycle, but says that until child protection services are adequately resourced, “nothing will change”. One northern district casework manager says the department had begun cutting resources in 2022. The office lost about a third of its staff. Between January and May last year, the manager says, the office closed “250 to 300 reports” it would have responded to if it could. “There was one in particular that sort of sticks in my mind,” the manager says. “A little girl who had been restored to her mother and then the shit hit the fan, the mum started using drugs again [and] associating with people that weren’t great for the little girl. And we were told we can’t allocate that. And so to my mind, why did we remove that child, work with mum to try and get things better, and put her back in a situation that was as bad as when she was removed? It was sickening. “There was domestic violence, there was serious neglect and physical abuse, like, you name it, across the board, we were just closing them because we had no capacity.” The manager says proper intervention is “intensive”. “If we can’t go into a family to work with them, to get some sort of change, these children grow up, and the only parenting role modelling they have is of their parents, and you continue a cycle. “There were kids who [are] now adults who were known to us as children who were being reported as new parents.” *** The cycle of violence is not guaranteed. It can be broken with adequate and timely support. Without it children who are exposed to domestic violence are more likely to have violent relationships as adults, whether they are the perpetrator or the victim. Sometimes they are both. “There are cases where, you know, the mother is violent towards the father, as well as the father being violent towards mum,” the casework manager says. “So the kids see that and go, ‘Oh, that’s normal.’ It’s really important to respond to those families quickly. And we try to come to it from an angle of trying to get people to understand the cycle.” The manager went on extended leave and pursued workers’ compensation: “I literally woke up one morning and couldn’t get out of bed. I just couldn’t do it.” ‘The worst of the worst’ Michael Smart says child protection workers are under extraordinary pressure and resourcing problems have reached crisis point. He is now an organiser at the Public Sector Association, the union that represents DCJ staff and other government workers. Encouraged by the success the teachers’ and paramedics’ unions had in securing pay rises after the 2023 election of the Minns Labor government, the PSA called for caseworkers to have their wages regraded, which would mean a $10,000 raise for entry-level employees, who are paid $79,302 on average and are almost always required to have completed a four-year social work or psychology degree. The government allocated $244m over the next year to move children out of emergency accommodation and to recruit more foster carers. But its budget didn’t include funding to meet the union’s demands of a pay rise and the hiring of 500 additional caseworkers. Negotiations continue. The government has conceded that the low response rates to reports of children at risk of significant harm reflect staff shortages. There were 233 unfilled caseworker positions across the state in March. For months there were only two caseworkers in Ballina available to respond to new risk-of-harm reports and they even had to buy their own stationery, according to an employee, and Lismore is also understaffed. The department maintains there has been no reduction in the number of funded caseworker roles across NSW and that, at the moment, there are no vacancies in Ballina. A spokesperson for DCJ said it reviewed every child’s ROSH report. Dr Jess Griffiths is a former caseworker who, when she started in Ballina in May 2021, was one of 16. By early 2023 only four were left, she says. Her workload became “just unbearable”. “The wheels had already fallen off,” Griffiths says. “[There] was just this constant kind of mental load that you carry, and all you’re trying to do is prioritise the worst of the worst.” Griffiths says many “really concerning” reports had to be closed. By the time she left the department, she says Ballina was so short-staffed it was only responding to reports about babies. Reports about coercive control, a strong predictor of future violence, did not receive attention she says. “Children just not going home, or not going to school, or running away from home or homeless on the street would never be allocated,” she says. Caseworkers ran evacuation centres during the extraordinary flooding that devastated the northern rivers in early 2022. More than two years later the Lismore office still hasn’t reopened. A local caseworker says staff only have 10 hours out of the 140 hours they work each month to meet families in person. The rest of their time is taken up by record keeping and paperwork, so “we can’t go face-to-face because we’re sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen”. The caseworker says reports which are “more difficult” to investigate, such as those relating to emotional and physical neglect, may be abandoned in favour of more immediately pressing reports about physical abuse and violence, even if DCJ has received dozens of calls about them. Child protection workers can be called to homes where families are living in overwhelming squalor. “If you were to put the TV series Hoarders in the minds of people, this is the stuff we deal with,” the Lismore caseworker says. “You’re talking maggots in fridges. You’re talking flies.” Some houses in subtropical Lismore are “absolutely full of black mould”. “There are people who are sick, they’re poor, and the department of housing [Homes NSW] doesn’t really give two shits about them,” the caseworker says. “I could take you to 25 houses that have a mould problem that’s been reported over and over and over again.” All of these houses have children living in them. “I have to say that if anybody down the pub saw what we saw, they would be absolutely outraged, because our tolerance for risk is so high,” the caseworker says. “And it has to be, because if our tolerance for risk was any lower, we’d be bringing way more children into care.” In June the state’s auditor general, Bola Oyetunji, handed down his review of child protection. The report was damning. It criticised the DCJ for not collecting appropriate data on what therapeutic services children needed and said that despite “numerous” previous reviews the department had not redirected its resources from a “crisis-driven” model to one of early intervention. Oyetunji also determined that the department had “failed in its duty of care” because it did not monitor the wellbeing of children in out-of-home care, even though it is required by law to do so. Over the past five years there has been a decline in the number of children returning to their parents. There were 569 “restorations” in 2018 and 417 in 2023. ‘Pretty much broke my soul’ The case of two young Aboriginal girls and their three older brothers who were removed from their mother because she could no longer take care of them sticks with one caseworker. The woman, it was believed, had an undiagnosed brain injury from being kicked in the head and hit by a relative. “That whole case pretty much broke my soul,” says Sam, a former Aboriginal child protection caseworker, who managed the family’s case for 18 months before she quit the department. “She was still a good mum and she loved her kids unconditionally but she just didn’t have that capacity to understand how to actually be a parent.” The children were separated and their cases taken on by two agencies. The girls went to Ngunya Jarjum, an Aboriginal-run organisation based in Lismore. Sam says the sisters were placed with a carer. When she and another caseworker went to collect them, they “stank of urine” and their heads were visibly crawling with lice. Ngunya Jarjum told Guardian Australia it did not comment on specific child protection matters due to the legal requirement to protect children’s privacy. The girls then went to another agency, Life without Barriers. They were placed with carers who weren’t Aboriginal. Sam says she felt frustrated with what she saw: “There just wasn’t really any motivation to keep the family connection with the two younger girls and the three older brothers,” she says. “They lived probably a five- to 10-minute drive from each other. And they were really trying to whittle their family contact down to one hour a month.” The children’s mother had to move home. While heavily pregnant, she spent 24 hours on a bus every month to get to and from the coast so she could attend mandatory court hearings relating to the removal of her children and, ideally, visit them. Sam says she tried to organise Life without Barriers and the carers to time the mother’s visits with seeing her girls, but she felt they weren’t accommodating. The boys went to We Care NSW and were placed in an “alternative care arrangement” (ACA) because no family could be found to take them in. They lived in a house under the supervision of shift workers arranged by We Care. We Care told Guardian Australia it did not manage children’s cases and this responsibility remained with the agency that referred children to them. ACAs are a type of “high-cost emergency care arrangement” (HCEA) in which children are placed in hotels, motels, serviced apartments or rental accommodation. Most are run as a for-profit service by labour-hire firms. Information tabled in parliament in March revealed that the youngest child living in one of these arrangements was just two. As of 11 March the child had spent 173 nights in this sort of care. Last August there were 471 children in HCEAs in NSW, according to the auditor general, with 30% living in hotels, motels and serviced apartments. These arrangements cost an average of $829,000 a year for each child, but the government has said they can reach up to $2m. In his review the auditor general found that shift workers without child protection qualifications delivered most of the care in emergency placements. His report found DCJ “lacks the systems” and reporting processes to gauge the quality of this care. Every caseworker Guardian Australia spoke to pointed to the privatisation of out-of-home care as a shift that changed everything for the worse. More than a decade ago the Coalition government relinquished most of the state’s responsibility for it, entrusting non-government organisations and private agencies with arranging foster care placements, residential homes and emergency care. These agencies are also meant to be responsible for ensuring that children are looked after. There were 12,352 children and young people in statutory out-of-home care in NSW at the end of March; 46.1% of them were Indigenous. In June 2021 58 out of every 1,000 Indigenous children in Australia were in out-of-home care. The system has been criticised as repeating the tragedy of the stolen generations, the Indigenous children who over a period of at least 60 years were forcibly removed from their homes. Some caseworkers argue that taking children into care can be unavoidable. But Sam says she worked with Aboriginal families who were treated with a stigma that she believes perpetuated the ongoing trauma of the stolen generations. “I don’t think there’s enough support available to those families that’s culturally appropriate,” she says. The auditor general has said DCJ has failed to deliver Aboriginal strategies and reforms in the last five years and that it has not developed holistic family preservation models based on Aboriginal ways of healing. Sam says she keeps coming back to the case of the family of five children. The girls sometimes went six weeks without seeing their brothers. She says she felt ongoing frustration, believing that Life without Barriers was reluctant to arrange makeup visits because of the cost. Guardian Australia sent detailed questions to Life without Barriers about Sam’s concerns. A spokesperson for the organisation said it was not able to comment on specific cases due to privacy and confidentiality obligations. “Aboriginal children have a right to grow in culture and with kin and for this reason, Life Without Barriers publicly committed to transition all Aboriginal children in our care to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations in NSW,” the spokesperson said. In late 2022 the NSW government awarded Ngunya Jarjum a five-year contract worth more than $63m. Life without Barriers – a charity which operates across the state – was given a contract for the same period worth more than $705m. “It’s an enormous amount of money,” Sam says. “And this is the type of treatment that the families get.” All up the government spent $1.9bn on out-of-home care in 2022-23. Workers say its outsourcing means children are often pulled out of one situation of neglect only to be dumped into another. The caseworkers say some agencies “cherrypick” cases – a baby or toddler will be easier to place in a foster home and cost less than an older child with a disability. One caseworker recalls a child being managed by an agency who was about to be returned to a home where a “massive domestic violence incident” had occurred. “There were older siblings in the home and they were becoming violent,” the caseworker says. “And there’s no way the agency was doing home visits, or they would have seen the holes in the walls and that the house had been absolutely trashed.” Another caseworker says: “You take [children] from the family because they’re at risk or they’re in danger or whatever. And then we put them in equally as dangerous situations and we leave them. I wonder long term what that cost is going to be. The litigation that the department is leaving themselves open to is enormous.” In March the families minister, Kate Washington, disclosed to the NSW parliament that the government had started tracking some out-of-home-care NGOs because she was so concerned about the quality of the information they were providing to her office and to magistrates. DCJ caseworkers, who represent the minister in court matters relating to children who have been removed from their families, raise similar concerns. Washington said nearly 100% of the information about the children in care that the department received was not accurate. Labor has blamed the Coalition for leaving it with a “broken” system. The opposition’s families spokesperson, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, says DCJ caseworker vacancies have increased under Labor. Across the state the government recorded a 7% vacancy rate in 2022. It was 10% at the end of March. Washington hasn’t said whether she’ll give caseworkers a raise or hire more of them. She has ordered an “urgent” review of out-of-home care, due to report back by the end of the year, and promised reform. A “dedicated team” has been created to move children out of emergency care. But, as one northern rivers caseworker says, it’s not as simple as “moving the kids” because there is such a massive shortage of foster carers. “There’s nowhere to put them,” the caseworker says. “That’s where we’re stuck. Organisations know that they’ve got the monopoly. That’s why they charge so much.” ‘Tears for all the children’ Before Betina Huber quit DCJ after 20 years in its Ballina office, she made a formal complaint. In an email, seen by the Guardian, the senior caseworker wrote that the job had become “intrinsically abusive” and unsafe. “Caseworkers and managers are continuously exposed to children’s suffering due to the inadequate and dysfunctional [out-of-home-care] system which was put in place by the department,” Huber wrote in the 11 December 2023 email. “The impact on children is devastating, unbearable to witness, causing us emotional and psychological harm, evidenced by the mass exodus of caseworkers, people going on sick leave like myself, and workers on [compensation] claims.” Huber said she had “despaired” about failing children. “I am sad for letting my team down now,” she wrote. “This is what burn out feels to me: Grief at feeling defeated … Tears for all the children who crossed my path and wondering how they are now, and the parents, and the colleagues.” She said outsourcing the minister’s responsibility to provide “safe and nurturing care for children in care” had “led to the endemic abuse of children”. She made 12 recommendations “as a matter of urgency”, including that DCJ employ professional care workers on salaries of $150,000 to look after children in emergency situations and keep them out of ACAs. Huber says she attended an internal meeting six weeks after she sent the email. “There were no outcomes, there were no minutes,” she tells the Guardian. “There was nothing. I then just felt like it was no point in staying there. Nothing was going to change.” A spokesperson for DCJ said it was unable to comment on individual employment or child protection matters due to privacy obligations. But the department concedes it needs to improve. The DCJ spokesperson said “we acknowledge there’s more work to be done to ensure all vulnerable children and families get the support they need”. Huber says the government is “traumatising” and “abusing” children in emergency care. “Sometimes they move 500km away, at which point it’s very difficult to keep contact with their parents,” she says. “And this is for children as young as newborns.” Children living “without love and care” often deteriorate within a couple of months, she says, because they don’t feel safe. “We’re spending so much money,” she says, “to actually harm children long term.” And money is both the problem and the solution for a system that is supposed to be keeping families together wherever it can. Too much funding is going to private contracts, frontline workers say, and not nearly enough to them. *** Despite his experience of the child protection system, Jason dreams of working with young people who have been removed from their families. He says he always wanted to be a social worker but, because of his history, fears he “can’t ever be that person that I wanted to be”. “I’ve always been thinking that, like, am I welcome? Am I good enough to be around certain people?” he says. “It always plays on your mind. “I still wish I could be able to help,” he says, his voice breaking. “I get emotional about it because … I just know exactly how much it affects everybody.” If he ends up being able to do the work that he wants, he will tell young people not to give up “no matter how empty you feel” or “how much you doubt yourself. You’ve got choices, and just choose wisely. It’s going to be a long journey, but you’ll see the other side of it all … “At the end of the day … I would say, ‘I’m proud to be able to stand before you to actually have this conversation.’ So, yeah, that’s what I’d say.” Do you know more?

                    "bodyText": "Every morning, California’s top firefighters get a forecast of the day in wildfire terms – when the wind will shift, how dry the ground is and a host of other ingredients that can start or spread a fire. Lately, the routine has an extra step: checking a machine’s opinion. “If we know that there’s going to be heightened fire activity or heightened fire weather in a certain area, we can use [a programme with AI] to validate that yes, this area’s purple,” meaning the highest alert level, explained chief Phillip SeLegue. If the AI gives that nod, “every response that we’re going to initiate, we’re going to augment that response with additional resources”. How drastically AI can change firefighting is already clear in wildfire responses. In early July, SeLegue was fighting a blaze in Los Padres National Forest, north of Los Angeles. A few years ago, if a 911 call came in reporting that a fire had started or spread, an analyst would hustle to predict its path, “to go in and pull all those different attributes. What is the fuel? What is the weather?” said SeLegue, listing half a dozen different factors. This took “a couple hours to several hours,” depending on the person doing it. Now, that entire process is automated. Any 911 fire call, once dispatched, also generates an AI prediction in “about 18 to 20 seconds,” said SeLegue, with unlimited new reports created on request. “We used them probably … 12 to 14 times just this morning,” he said one day from the Los Padres fire. After the cataclysmic wildfire seasons of the past few years, the pressure is on to get a step ahead of fires. Predicting their spread is increasingly important, but so is an even harder task: predicting, days in advance, when a big blaze is likely to break out. You need to know, first, how much burnable vegetation there is across vast swaths of land, and second, how dried out it is. The third factor, and the hardest to predict, is a spark of ignition, which can be something human-caused like a cigarette butt or a lightning strike. What’s more, all that data needs to be recrunched anew every day as the weather forecast changes. Humans can do this. But AI seems to be able to do it better, digesting mammoth datasets to predict wildfires fairly accurately as much as a week or even 10 days before they start. “We cannot run the typical algorithms to do this type of analysis. The amount of data is huge … you need more power,” said Adrián Cardil. Cardil is a scientist at Technosylva, which provides California with the AI-informed programme that SeLegue has been using, as well as similar versions in several other American states, in addition to Chile, Spain, the Netherlands and other places. His team first had to get an accurate portrait of California’s shrubland and timber forests. Lidar, a very high-resolution sensor operated by plane or drone, provided 3D maps of thousands of acres with as many as 500 data points a square metre. “It’s amazing,” said Cardil. “You can even see the leaves.” AI mapped the other 60-70% of the state. Analysing the Lidar-viewed land, it was able to understand what vegetation was present elsewhere but only captured in lower-quality images. Technosylva used a rigorous verification process afterwards to ensure the AI was getting it right. From there, they are able to incorporate weather data, running models every day to calculate the vegetation’s moisture, said Cardil. “If the plants are drier, the ignition and the fire spread are going to be easier.” Added to that is the chance of ignition. Technosylva’s work is part of a wave of new fire modelling around the world drawing on AI and grappling each project in a different way, with the same three factors: fuel, weather, ignition. Many are not yet operational, but their creators expect them to be in the next couple of years. The US fire service, for example, is tasked with maintaining a fuel map for the United States, which it does in increments of 30 by 30 metres, about the size of two basketball courts. It uses AI and Google Earth images to go even higher-res in one project, down to tens of centimetres, allowing scientists to register bare ground and rocks between plants, which can serve as natural fire-breakers. “We need really fine-resolution information about the spatial patterning of even just grass clumps,” said Greg Dillon of the Fire Service. “And the more data you get, the more you need machine learning and AI-type classifiers to make sense of it.” The third factor, ignition, presents other problems, for obvious reasons. “One of the hardest things to predict is lightning-caused fires,” said Piyush Jain, a Canadian government scientist. A whole host of scientists are experimenting with using AI to predict lightning, including those at several American federal agencies – Nasa, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the US fire service – as well as academics and private companies around the world. Many of their projects ask machines to process years, sometimes decades, of weather records in order to find clues about what tends to accompany lightning strikes. One NOAA AI-based model, for example, predicts lightning across the entire US for the following hour. It is building on this with a new project meant to predict lightning that poses a wildfire risk, especially “dry” lightning unaccompanied by rain. A fire service model aims to predict fire-starting lightning for each 20-square-kilometre patch of the US a full week ahead of time, using a statistical model based on 25 years of hourly lightning data – a massive data-processing effort that, again, was made possible by AI. Still, one of the world’s most ambitious fire prediction projects abandoned the idea of zeroing in on one risk factor, and instead, zoomed out to the whole planet, testing the limits of AI in the process. Scientists from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) set out to predict wildfires anywhere on Earth about a week ahead of time. Working on this scale, they eschewed on-the-ground vegetation mapping, since it is not consistent around the world. Instead, they took basic land classification maps, showing if an area is evergreen or savannah, for example, and fed their AI programme with satellite data that measures Co2 levels in the air. “That will tell us … how active vegetation is,” said Joe McNorton, a researcher at ECMWF. In other words, it measures carbon sinks and infers how much fuel is available to burn in a given area. Their programme also feeds in global satellite weather data, and the AI was trained by looking for huge fires that could be spotted by a satellite. Now, it produces one global wildfire prediction a day, for the next 10 days, with a nine km resolution around the planet. Surprisingly even to those who made it, it seems to work for this biggest category of fire. It was able to predict the Canadian wildfires last year about 10 days ahead, said McNorton. In California, SeLegue said he still doesn’t know all the details of the part AI plays, but he doesn’t need to: “It’s baked into it,” he shrugged. But what’s more important was obvious, he said: “It improved the accuracy.”"

He has also criticised Nigel Farage for amplifying false information, and said he had been “deeply irresponsible and dangerous” in trying to amplify “false information”. He also hit out at Farage for condemning the breakdown of law and order before the riots “but not the riots themselves”. Elon Musk was also a target for Tugendhat, who said the unelected billionaire’s claim that civil war was inevitable amid the disorder in parts of the UK was “delusional” and “simply false” Tugendhat also accused the prime minister of “pretending” that he inherited full prisons and had to introduce an early release scheme. The early release scheme had actually begun under Rishi Sunak’s government. Tugendhat also said that Starmer should have sacked Jess Phillips over her reaction to footage of journalists being menaced on camera Former justice minister David Gauke has cautioned that the current contest for the Conservative party leadership is failing to learn the lesson of why the party suffered such a huge defeat in the general election, and the crop of candidates are “too frightened of the party membership” Health secretary Wes Streeting has said he “totally understands” why the families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates have accused the NHS of having “blood on its hands”.

The numbers appear to suggest that a third of claimants sent notices to migrate to the universal credit system have not responded to them, and their legacy benefit claims have been closed The UK jobs market bucked predictions of a further weakening in June after official figures showed unemployment fell – but wages growth slowed to its lowest for two years Conservative leadership candidate James Cleverly seized on today’s economic news to suggest that things were going well for the economy under Rishi Sunak’s government. “Inflation down. Employment up. Fastest growth in the G7. That was Labour’s real economic inheritance, but Rachel Reeves still wants to raise your taxes,” he said. Priti Patel commented “We must continue to hold Labour to account over their falsehoods on the economy. Today’s positive news on employment figures shows the Conservatives left an economy moving in the right direction” Labour market statistics have shown Scotland’s GDP grew by 0.3% in May, and by 0.9% in the three months leading up to May.

Thank you for reading. I will be back with you tomorrow. Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor Anas Sarwar has suggested Scotland has so far escaped the violent riots which have hit England and Northern Ireland in part because the media and Tories in Scotland did not whip up resentment over immigration and race. The Scottish Labour leader told the Matt Forde’s podcast The Political Party he thought it essential that Scotland avoided thinking there was “a DNA difference” between someone in Scotland and someone in England. But he added: “Do I think our demographics are different? Yes. Do I think our political discourse is different in Scotland? Yes. Do I think our chattering class and our media is different in Scotland? Yes. Do I think we have less of a thriving right wing or right of centre media bubble in Scotland? Yes. “I think all of that has helped contribute to us not having the same problems as you have seen in other parts of the UK. I think there are certain things the UK Conservative party and UK Conservative politicians would say that thankfully up until now a Scottish Conservative politician would not say, and I think that something to be welcomed.” But he said there was still “engrained prejudice” in every community in Scotland, while the far right tried to mobilise, particularly in Glasgow. But the country’s closeness and a very well organised community resistance to the far right had helped “repel them”, he said. Sarwar’s remarks point to different Scottish editions of UK papers blamed for stirring up prejudice, such as the Daily Mail. The Mail in Scotland routinely runs different lead stories to editions in England. The Scottish Tories are habitually closer to the centre than at UK level, and avoid the Tory rhetoric and attack lines on migration and multi-culturalism adopted since Theresa May’s departure as prime minister. Something a little lighter here from the Guardian’s Scotland editor Severin Carrell: Anas Sarwar has revealed that Keir Starmer has a unique place in the Sarwar family home in Glasgow. There the prime minister is a pro-wrestler who fights Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un on the PlayStation. The Scottish Labour leader told a fringe festival audience in Edinburgh that he came home a few days ago to hear Starmer’s name being shouted out by his eight-year-old son; he peeped around the door to find Starmer fighting a bout alongside Joe Biden. Sarwar told Matt Forde’s Political Party his oldest son was heavily into football, while his 14-year-old was keen on American pool, “and I have got an eight-year-old who has an obsession with wrestling, and we watch WWE together, which is great fun. “And I came home last week and I heard him playing his WWE 2K24 on his PlayStation [and] all I could hear was him going ‘SIR KEIR STAAARMER’, and I thought what was he doing, and he was playing his wrestling game. “He’s downloaded Keir Starmer as a wrestler and I was watching him, and he was doing a wrestling match with Keir Starmer and Joe Biden versus Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un and Rishi Sunak. He’s downloaded those characters to his wrestling. I’ve not told Keir yet. “He of course wants Starmer to win, but he’s now threatening to create a character for me and make it available for public download.” The PSNI has said in a statement that a second man has been arrested in connection with an attack on a mosque at the weekend in Newtownards. It said “The man, aged 46, was arrested on suspicion of a number of offences, including attempted arson with intent to endanger life, making a petrol bomb and criminal damage. He has since been released on police bail.” With apposite timing, while Tom Tugendhat was giving that talk blaming all and sundry for the recent violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland, Maya Goodfellow, author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats, has this opinion column for us today: Westminster must take a long, hard look at itself: what many politicians now condemn, they also had a hand in manufacturing. The political “centre” usually reacts to the far right by denouncing its methods and distancing themselves from its coarse, racist rhetoric – but ultimately conceding to its underlying argument. In the days after the general election, Tony Blair advised Keir Starmer that to ward off the far right, he should celebrate what is good about immigration but be sure to “control” it. No matter how respectable and sensible such advice may seem to some within our political classes, the sentiment that “controlling” immigration is a way to appease socially conservative voters is one cause of the corrosiveness. Why? Because it implies that a fear of immigration is a legitimate concern, and that reducing immigration is the appropriate method to assuage that fear. It is this sentiment that could shape what comes next. One Conservative commentator has already suggested that reducing immigration is at least part of the picture in responding to the violence. In an acutely uncomfortable TV interview about the riots with the independent MP Zarah Sultana, Ed Balls maintained that “if you fail to control and manage immigration properly then things go wrong”. Are concerns about immigration “legitimate”? Demonstrably, no. People who arrive in the UK aren’t to blame for an economy designed to benefit the richest while exploiting and abandoning the poorest – immigration is not a significant causal factor of low wages and it’s not why people have insecure jobs. Anti-immigrant feeling isn’t a natural, inevitable reaction to change either. One study found areas with low levels of immigration had some of the highest proportion of leave voters in them – a vote that was at least partly motivated by anti-immigrant concerns. No: it is mainstream politicians and certain sections of the media that summon these feelings. They characterise certain groups of people, usually those who aren’t white (or not-quite-white), as a cultural threat – often targeting Muslims, no matter where they were born. Read more here: Maya Goodfellow – We keep hearing about ‘legitimate concerns’ over immigration. The truth is, there are none Conservative leadership candidate Tom Tugendhat has criticised the reporting of some court cases involving the use of social media, saying that in some cases it has “stretched the truth quite markedly”. After criticism of sentences handed out to people who were found guilty of incitement online, Tugendhat said “It isn’t just that somebody said something, it’s that they also recommended how to attack, how to do harm, how to bring violence to individuals. That’s not the same.” He said “Freedom of speech is not unqualified. Freedom of speech and freedom of expression is the ability to associate and share ideas, and we need to be very careful that when we say various freedoms are limited, that it’s not just being wrong that’s limited, it’s not just being mistaken that’s limited, it’s when you are actively doing harm. That’s where we have got to balance these rights.” A couple of more things from the Q&amp;A afterwards with Tom Tugendhat which PA Media have picked up on. He ruled out making a deal with Reform UK if he became Conservative leader. He said Elon Musk’s claim that civil war was inevitable amid the disorder in parts of the UK was “delusional” and “simply false”. He also said on social media that “I refuse to be on TikTok because the algorithm is set by a foreign dictatorship” I should just add, by the way, that I use Otter AI to transcribe speeches like that, which is way more reliable than my shorthand, but does mean as I try to put it into the King’s English and/or Guardian style for the blog as I go along I sometimes miss homophones, US spellings, or the fact it simply refuses to learn how to spell Keir Starmer correctly, so apologies if you spotted any of that in the last few blocks. I didn’t quite catch who it was, I think it was Christian Calgie of the Daily Express, who given the opportunity to ask a question of Tom Tugendhat, said: Mass immigration. Segregated communities. Lack of prison places. Weak justice for criminals. Importing identity politics from abroad. Looking at cracking down on freedom of speech. Collapsing social trust. This is just a shocking list of Tory failures, isn’t it? Tugendhat replied that “this is a list of areas that we must improve on. And it’s not Tory or Labour. It is a list of areas that this country must get better at.” The Tory leadership hopeful continued “You can import division. You can import ideas of separateness. Or you can remember who you are. “One of the great things about this country, one of the things I love about this country, is we don’t qualify Britishness. We’re not like some countries where you’re a hyphenated nation, you’re just British. And we should be deeply proud of that.” “You’re just British” is going to come as surprising news to the considerable number of people within the UK who identify more closely with one of its constituent parts than with the whole. In this speech as part of his leadership bid for the Conservative party, shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat has made this pitch, saying: This is not a counsel of despair. If we are honest with ourselves, the solutions will follow. The reform of our police and criminal justice system, the renewal and in some cases, replacement of our national institutions. The restoration of pride in our community and our country, its history and its culture, the rejection of militant identity politics in all its forms, the construction of a new economic model and the promise of a new social contract in which we understand our obligations as well as our rights and we all have the respect and the self-respect that comes with fending for ourselves, providing for our families and contributing to our common life together. It will take honesty, and it will take courage, and it will take leadership. But of course, it can be done, because what needs to be done in the national interest must be done. After a lengthy passage listing everything he thinks is wrong with the modern UK, Tom Tugendhat finishes by describing it as “the greatest country on Earth”. He said: Too many people live in communities shorn of civic pride and social capital, too many have lost their sense of self as they are denied opportunity and purpose in their lives. Many people are told, in effect, that they are not needed, that they have too little to contribute. They are parked on benefits and forgotten and social trust is collapsing. We’ve seen equality of opportunity give way to critical race theory, while the root causes of inequalities go ignored. Activist groups warp the language of inclusion to get what they want, universities indulge in ideologies of grievance instead of transmitting knowledge. Schools, museums and galleries apologise for our country’s history instead of objectively explaining it, and yes, celebrating it. Ministers are promising a legal definition of Islamophobia, creating a blasphemy law for one faith when anti-Muslim hatred is already a crime. This will undermine free speech, afford special protections uniquely to the beliefs of one religion, and protect extremists from scrutiny and investigation. And we can already see that activists on the left are trying to use the riots to silence those with mainstream concerns about immigration. We need patriotism and purpose, the patriotism that sees us all part of one nation and the purpose of seeing the goal of our shared prosperity and security, and we need to end the culture of denying the tendency to move hurriedly on from acts of extreme violence, to obfuscate about the identities and motives of the perpetrators. It is worth noting that latter part in particular, as earlier in the speech he criticised Nigel Farage for expressing his idea that “the truth is being hidden” by authorities about stabbings in Southport and Kent. In a passage likely to draw a sharp response from the government, Conservative leadership hopeful Tom Tugendhat has accused the prime minister of “pretending” that he inherited full prisons and had to introduce an early release scheme. Citing a study suggesting than more people with multiple convictions are avoiding jail sentences, Tugendhat said: Just as he is set to raise taxes, Keir Starmer is doing here what he fundamentally believes in, in this case, releasing criminals early while pretending that he is forced to do so, because that is the inheritance from the Tories. Now we know it’s nonsense for two reasons. First, he chose to appoint a prisons minister, Lord Timpson, who thinks that only a third of current prisoners should be behind bars. And second, since the riots, the government has done what it had previously said was impossible. It has created an extra 567 prison places from within the existing estate, yet the government’s mass prisoner release scheme doesn’t start until September. Now, nobody denies that there are problems with prison capacity, and of course, we should be better at prisoner rehabilitation and much better at probation, but prison punishes offenders and takes dangerous and prolific criminals out of circulation, allowing the rest of us to live in peace. We should be updating and improving our prisoners, not releasing criminals. It is worth noting that the early release of prisoners was started under Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that prison capacity and sentencing guidlines had been in the gift of the Conservative party during the 14 years it spent in government, including the times during which Tugendhat was minister. Tugendhat is being disngenious here on numbers, too. It is also the case that prisons were not full, and the Labour government did not claim they were full – but they were below the minimum level of spare capacity of about 900 places which the Prison Service believes is necessary to take account of buildings falling out of use due to illness or safety reasons, or for there to be a sudden surge in prisoner numbers caused by, say, widespread social unrest. Tom Tugendhat has criticised policing in Birmingham and the West Midlands for, he said “deferring to so-called community leaders while pubs and cars were attacked, windows broken and citizens intimidated.” He said: This is not as the police oath requires, policing without fear or favour. No police officer should ever tolerate the presence of a militia, no matter what the provocation or the cause they claim. The intrusion of politics, the politics of protest, the politics of the self-appointed community leaders into policing, must simply end. He proposes a programme of police reform, which would include making “a new national security police force” and taking counter-terrorism responsibilities from the Metropolitan police. He says it could cover not just anti-terrorism but “also state threats”. Tom Tugendhat has said he wants “a tougher, bigger police force”, but says “that also requires better police leadership and the honesty to address recent failings”, referencing what he called “the perma-crisis at the Met.” Tugendhat has repeatedly referred to anti-Israel marches and said “there was inaction in the face of blatant criminality” during them. He says that as security minister “I constantly had to encourage the police to make arrests on the day as crimes were being committed, rather than waiting until after the protest had finished” during pro-Palestinian marches. In a marked contrast from shadow cabinet messaging during the recent riots in England and Northern Ireland, Conservative leadership hopeful Tom Tugendhat has accused the prime minister of failing the country in the last two weeks. He said: I want to consider the issue of leadership. This has been the government’s first real test, and the prime minister fell short when we needed a strong government. We got a party in the mindset of opposition. We needed a leader. We got a lawyer waiting for the case to reach court. These are early days for the government, and government isn’t easy, but government isn’t a game either. It is more than press releases and retweets, and you can’t be wise with hindsight, something Labour mastered in opposition. You have to be determined and aware throughout. You have to be ready to do the job from day one, public order is too precious, too essential to all of us to be taken for granted. Tugendhat has gone on to criticise Starmer for not chairing daily Cobra meetings with the police and army from day one. A prime minister not convening or attending Cobra meetings is tricky ground for the Conservatives. He says that Jess Phillips should have been sacked, and “the riots could and should have been stopped earlier.” Tom Tugendhat has said Nigel Farage has been “deeply irresponsible and dangerous” in trying to amplify “false information”. He also hit out at Farage for condemning the breakdown of law and order before the riots “but not the riots themselves”. He went on to criticise Jess Phillips’ response to scenes of journalists being threatened, calling it “a failure of leadership”. He says “it is not the only failure of leadership by Keir Starmer government over these last two weeks.” Tom Tugendhat says we cannot use the “rays of sunshines” of people coming together to clear up after riots to “ignore those whose actions reflect the very worst of our society.” He condemns “the racist thugs who attacked a mosque in Southport, the sectarian gang who burned down a Muslim-owned shop in Belfast, the mob who set fire to a hotel housing migrants in Rotherham, we need to ask ourselves how we got here and what we must do about it.” He has now gone on to say “too often over the last two decades or more, we have avoided being brutally honest about the underlying social unrest across society.” Shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat has opened by saying that “I want to get straight to the point. The disorder we have seen on our streets in the past two weeks is completely unacceptable. Every single perpetrator, every instigator, must be investigated, prosecuted and severely punished. And as a country, we have some serious soul searching ahead of us.” Conservative leadership candidate and shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat has begun his speech. You can watch it here if you wish … There is quite a bit of constituency work being mentioned on social media during recess by MPs, and at least one of them making me feel nostalgic for Edinburgh … We are expecting Tom Tugendhat, who as well as being a candidate for the Conservative leadership is Rishi Sunak’s shadow security minister, to make a speech in a few minutes. It is clearly part of his leadership campaign, but PA have billed it as “Tom Tugendhat MP will make a speech calling for a national conversation about the underlying causes of the riots, the breakdown of Britain’s social fabric and the rise of criminality on our streets.” It is worth noting that during the violent disorder of the last two weeks, Conservative spokespersons and shadow ministers on the media round were broadly supportive of the government’s response to the crisis. Health secretary Wes Streeting has said he “totally understands” why the families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates have accused the NHS of having “blood on its hands”. The three were killed by Valdo Calocane, who admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and who was sentenced to indefinite detention in a high-security hospital. Speaking to viewers on Sky News, Streeting said: The hard truth here is that had the NHS done its job, had there not been multiple fundamental failures, three innocent people might still be alive. That’s why I totally understand why they’ve accused the NHS of having blood on its hands. For three grieving families, we are seeing the consequences of what happens when mental health services don’t do what they are legally required to do in terms of supervision of patients, provision of medicine and closer supervision of those who might be at risk of harming themselves or other people. That’s why I’m not ever going to duck the scale of the challenge or the reality that we face today and we inherited at the election. We are going to take action right across the board, but particularly in mental health. Whether that’s recruiting 8,000 more mental health staff to help cut the waiting list, doing more at the prevention end by putting mental health support in every primary and secondary school in the country, and walk-in hubs in every community. And reforming the Mental Health Act in a way that gets the balance right between recognising there are people whose liberties are being deprived today, who could live safely in the community, but also recognising for others, there needs to be much better and closer, supervision, so that people like Valdo Calocane are not able to be on the streets causing risk or indeed fatalities to others.” Posting a clip of his interview to social media, Streeting said “I will spare everyone ‘lessons must be learned’. Action is under way”. Former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for an inquiry into the process of migrating people on to universal credit after the DWP has published a set of figures which he suggests is “extremely worrying” and “could mean many of the poorest are losing all support”. The numbers appear to suggest that a third of claimants sent notices to migrate to the universal credit system have not responded to them, and their legacy benefit claims have been closed. McDonell was among seven Labour MPs who had the whip suspended in July for six months after he voted for an SNP amendment during the king’s speech debate. Alex Davies-Jones, the minister for victims and violence against women and girls, has just posted a video of a visit to Tamworth, where in recent far-right led violent disorder a hotel housing asylum seekers was targeted. In the video the Pontypridd MP tells residents “everything you’ve been through, it’s awful, but we want you to know we are here to support you and help you.” One of the local residents in the video observes “in these sort of situations we realise the community spirit that comes after. It’s very much been in abundance, and everybody’s really pulled together.” Another person in the clip says they have remained in contact with some of those who have been forced to move away from the hotel, saying they are “very scared and confused” by what has happened. Our community team are asking for your experiences of being affected by industrial action from GPs in England. You can find out how to get in touch with them here … Tom Tugendhat is expected to speak later on as part of his campaign for the Conservative party leadership. He has just published a campaign video, and I must confess, reading the transcript, for the first few paragraphs you would be hard-pressed to differentiate this from the kind of speech Labour leader Keir Starmer was giving in opposition: The choice now is not about how do we change the past. I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do about that. It’s how do we change the future. That is the choice that is now being asked of you, and all of us, actually, as members, as to how we decide to act. Well, the choice is pretty stark, let’s be honest. It’s do we repeat the mistakes of the past? Do we continue to argue amongst ourselves to see factionalism and self-interest, or do we instead change? Do we end the broken promises and actually start delivering? Do we stop the division and start uniting? Tugendhat did get round though to specifically addressing what this means for the Conservative party, which he said had been “the natural party of government” for 200 years “built on trusting and being trusted by the British people.” He said the party needed to “start uniting, and not just uniting amongst Conservatives, but uniting across the country.” He continued: Let’s be clear, I’m a soldier, and I believe in being clear on what our mission is, and the mission of the Conservative party is pretty simple. It is to sustain and to select conservative voices across the United Kingdom. We need to stop being obsessed by Westminster, and start being obsessed by the country. We need to remember that we are a party built from the ground up, not the top down. We need to remember that when we preach conservatism, you know what? It would be a good idea to practise it. You can watch it here … Conservative leadership candidate Priti Patel has also commented on today’s economic news. She posted to social media to say: We must continue to hold Labour to account over their falsehoods on the economy. Today’s positive news on employment figures shows the Conservatives left an economy moving in the right direction. Labour are looking for any excuse to raise taxes, which will only damage jobs, growth and hit hardworking families and businesses hard. Patel has also said that yesterday she spoke to Conservative members of the Senedd, adding “The Welsh Labour government has been a disaster on almost every issue. Our Conservative MSs play a crucial role in holding them to account. If I am elected leader, we will work together to be an effective opposition on both fronts.” Alex Hern’s TechScape newsletter this week looks at the limits of laws around social media. He writes: It’s odd to feel sorry for an inanimate object, but I wonder if the Online Safety Act is getting sort of a rough deal, since it is barely in effect. The act, a mammoth piece of legislation with more than 200 separate clauses, passed in 2023, but the bulk of its changes will only have power once Ofcom completes a laborious process of consultation and code-of-conduct creation. In the meantime, all the act offers are a handful of new criminal offences, including bans on cyberflashing and upskirting. Two of the new crimes have been given their first road test this week, after portions of the old malicious communications offence was replaced by the more specific threatening and false communications offences. But what if everything had moved quicker, and Ofcom had been up and running? Would anything have changed?

PA Media reports data released by Public Health Scotland shows 942 people waited longer than half a day – about 3.7% of total attendances at Scotland’s emergency departments in the week to 4 August. Elsewhere, the proportion of patients seen within four hours remained at the same level as the previous week – 67.9%. The SNP’s health secretary Neil Gray said: “We continue to see an improved position compared to recent weeks in A&amp;E performance, with over two-thirds of people being seen in our emergency departments within four hours. Although we have the best performing core A&amp;E departments in the UK, performance remains below the level we all wish to see.” There was a word of caution, however, from Scottish Conservative health spokesperson Dr Sandesh Gulhane, who said one-third of patients waiting longer than normal has become the “dangerous and unacceptable norm”. The government has told the families of the Nottingham attack victims it will slow down mental health care reforms in the wake of a damning report on the treatment that Valdo Calocane received in the years before the killings. Midlands correspondent Jessica Murray has more here … Labour’s parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, Kirsty McNeill, has also reacted to the economic news from the country today. In a statement the MP for Midlothian said: Today’s figures are encouraging but there is still a lot of work to do and the UK government is going to deliver the change the country needs. Giving people support to join the workforce and the security they need to remain in fairly paid jobs is vital as we tackle poverty and grow the economy. We’re banning exploitative zero-hours contracts, we’ve taken the first steps to make the national minimum wage a real living wage, and we’re planning JobCentre reform. Labour market statistics have shown Scotland’s GDP grew by 0.3% in May, and the Scottish government says the latest figures represent the highest number of payrolled employees in Scotland since July 2014, with median monthly pay the highest recorded yet. [See 10.23 BST] This block initially erroneously said that Kirsty McNeill was secretary of state for Scotland. That is Ian Murray. Rory Carroll is the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent A group of 120 police officers from Scotland is to receive orientation training in Belfast on Tuesday before a week-long deployment to bolster the over-stretched Police Service of Northern Ireland. The reinforcements, which are specially trained in public order, arrived amid a lull in rioting, with Belfast calm in recent days after torrid scenes last week. The PSNI chief constable, Jon Boutcher, requested the deployment to relieve a force he said was “exhausted”. The Police Federation of Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said the force was at “breaking point”. Four men appeared in court on Monday charged with riot-related offences, bringing the total who have been charged with offences to 29. Among them is an 11-year-old boy. Unlike in England and Wales there are no fast-track prosecutions. Most of the disturbances have been in loyalist areas of Belfast and aimed at immigrants, refugees and Muslims. However on Saturday youths in a republican area of Derry targeted police with stones, fireworks and petrol bombs, injuring 10 officers. “This was recreational rioting orchestrated probably by dissident republicans,” said Colum Eastwood, the Foyle MP and Social Democratic and Labour Party leader. Labour market statistics have shown Scotland’s GDP grew by 0.3% in May, and by 0.9% in the three months leading up to May, PA Media reports. The SNP’s deputy first minister and economy secretary Kate Forbes said: Today’s figures show the welcome news that payrolled employment and median monthly pay are at record highs. However, many households and businesses are still feeling the effects of harsh trading conditions and the global cost-of-living crisis. That’s why we are prioritising action to tackle child poverty, grasp the opportunities of net zero and support growth within the restrictions of the devolution settlement. Over the current financial year, we are investing more than £5bn to drive growth in the economy. We will continue to work with the UK government where we can, while encouraging them to support investment in Scotland’s economy and an end to spending cuts from Westminster. The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that from April to June, the estimated unemployment rate in Scotland for people aged 16 and older was 4.4%. The employment rate was 73.4% and the inactivity rate was estimated to be at 23.1%. The Scottish government says the figures represent the highest number of payrolled employees in Scotland since July 2014. The median monthly pay was estimated by HMRC to be £2,427 in July, the highest recorded yet. Conservative leadership candidate James Cleverly has also seized on today’s economic news to suggest that things were going well for the economy under Rishi Sunak’s government, which was heavily defeated in July’s general election. Cleverly posted to social media to say: Inflation down. Employment up. Fastest growth in the G7. That was Labour’s real economic inheritance, but Rachel Reeves still wants to raise your taxes. It might be a little bit slow on the politics front, but economic news does not have a summer recess. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has an analysis piece today in which he says the jobs market uncertainty is causing a headache for Bank of England rate setters, while Julia Kollewe has the unwelcome news that grocery price inflation in Great Britain has risen for first time in 17 months. Energy regulator Ofgem has approved a £3.4bn electricity “superhighway” between Scotland and England in the biggest single investment for electricity transmission infrastructure in Britain, PA Media reports. The 500km (311-mile) project will stretch from Aberdeenshire to North Yorkshire and transport renewable energy. The joint venture between Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and National Grid is part of a push to modernise the electricity grid, and Ofgem said it will carry enough renewable electricity to power two million homes. A lot of MPs are on holiday or working in their constituencies during summer recess, but a handful continue to be very vocal on social media, including Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice. He has suggested this morning that the number of people crossing the Channel should constitute a “national emergency”. Tice has also repeated his demand that there should be arrests over violence involving police at Manchester airport several weeks ago. Two police officers are under criminal investigation for assault, and police officers and members of the public were injured in an incident that was widely seen on social media. The UK jobs market bucked predictions of a further weakening in June after official figures showed unemployment fell but wages growth slowed to its lowest for two years. Unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 4.2% from 4.4% in the three months to June from the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, wage growth, excluding bonuses, was 5.4% year on year over the three months to June, slipping from 5.7% in the previous three months and represented the smallest increase since the period to July 2022, when it was 5.2%. Adjusted for inflation, wages rose by 1.6%, meaning many workers will experience a continued improvement in their standard of living. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “Today’s figures show there is more to do in supporting people into employment because if you can work, you should work. “This will be part of my budget later in the year where I will be making difficult decisions on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.” Reeves will deliver her first budget on 30 October. Read more here: UK unemployment falls as wages growth hits lowest in two years You can also follow live coverage of reaction to those figures on our business live blog with my colleague Graeme Wearden: As if to underline David Gauke’s point that the Conservative leadership candidates are yet to show their teeth in the contest, Kemi Badenoch has just merrily retweeted Mel Stride talking about today’s unemployment figures. In his post, Stride said: Figures out this morning show unemployment fell and employment rose in the second quarter of this year. More evidence that Labour’s claims of the ‘worst economic inheritance since the second world war’ are complete fantasy. They inherit an unemployment rate half what they left us in 2010. Former justice minister David Gauke has cautioned that the current contest for the Conservative party leadership is failing to learn the lesson of why the party suffered such a huge defeat in the general election, and the crop of candidates are “too frightened of the party membership”. In an interview on Times Radio, he told listeners “You want it to be a respectful leadership campaign. You don’t want lots of abuse. But the Conservative party suffered a massive defeat in July, its worst performance in its history, and there’s an awful lot of soul searching that needs to be done. “And in the end, whoever wins this contest isn’t going to be able to lead on the basis of unity. You’re actually going to have to have a platform and demonstrate leadership, and hope to persuade people to fall in behind you. Appeals to unity aren’t going to cut it if you are not making progress in the opinion polls, if you are not looking like an alternative government.” Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel, Mel Stride and Tom Tugendhat are running to be leader. Gauke was one of several MPs suspended from the party by then prime minister Boris Johnson in 2019 over his votes on Brexit issues. He told Times Radio he had now rejoined the party in order to have his say in the leadership contest. He suggested that one element in the contest might be people seeking to emulate “a very successful model deployed in 2020 by Keir Starmer.” Gauke said “[Starmer] ran as a continuity candidate. Then about a year after he won, changed strategy, demonstrated some leadership, was a ‘change’ leader trying to modernise his party, and that resulted in success. “At the moment, you feel that all of the [Conservative leadership] candidates are too tentative to do that, that they’re too frightened of the party membership. Maybe thinking get through on the other side, and then who knows what you can do. But at the moment, by and large, they do feel as if they’re just sort of wanting to get there first and then we’ll do the modernisation afterwards.” “The difficulty with that strategy is that you don’t have a mandate, and that people will cry betrayal, and that you might not have the authority you need to do what I think has to be a very big, very ambitious modernisation of the party.” Welcome to our rolling coverage of UK politics for Tuesday.

                    "bodyText": "In mid-2019, I was reading a fascinating piece in Cosmos magazine, one of Australia’s eminent science publications. There was this one image of a man lying on an operating table, covered in bags of McCain’s frozen french fries and hash browns. Scientists had discovered rapid cooling of the body might improve the survival rates of patients who had experienced heart attacks. This man was one such patient, thus the Frozen Food Fresco. The accompanying report was written by Paul Biegler, a bioethicist at Monash University, who had visited a trauma ward in Alfred hospital, Melbourne, to learn about this method in an effort to understand if humans could, in some distant future, be capable of hibernation. It’s the kind of story I return to when I start panicking about AI’s infiltration into the news. AI, after all, can’t visit Alfred hospital and – at least right now – it’s not conducting any interviews. But AI-generated articles are already being written and their latest appearance in the media signals a worrying development. Last week, it was revealed staff and contributors to Cosmos claim they weren’t consulted about the rollout of explainer articles billed as having been written by generative artificial intelligence. The articles cover topics like “what is a black hole?” and “what are carbon sinks?” At least one of them contained inaccuracies. The explainers were created by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and then fact-checked against Cosmos’s 15,000-article strong archive. Full details of the publication’s use of AI were published by the ABC on August 8. In that article, CSIRO Publishing, an independent arm of CSIRO and the current publisher of Cosmos, stated the AI-generated articles were an “experimental project” to assess the “possible usefulness (and risks)” of using a model like GPT-4 to “assist our science communication professionals to produce draft science explainer articles”. Two former editors said that editorial staff at Cosmos were not told about the proposed custom AI service. It comes just four months after Cosmos made five of its eight staff redundant. The ABC also wrote that Cosmos contributors were not aware of its intention to roll out the AI model, nor did it notify them that their work would be used as part of the fact-checking process. CSIRO Publishing dismissed concerns that the AI service was trained on contributors’ articles, with a spokesperson noting the experiment used a pre-trained GPT-4 model from OpenAI. But the lack of internal transparency and consultation has left journalists and contributors feeling betrayed and angry. Multiple sources suggest the experiment has now been put on pause, but CSIRO Publishing did not respond to a request for comment. The controversy has provided a dizzying sense of deja vu. We’ve seen this before. Well-respected US tech website CNET, where I served as science editor until August 2023, published dozens of articles generated by a custom AI engine at the end of 2022. In total, CNET’s robot writer racked up 77 bylines and, after investigation by rival publications, more than half of its articles were found to contain inaccuracies. The backlash was swift and damning. One report said the internet was “horrified” by CNET’s use of AI. The Washington Post dubbed the experiment “a journalistic disaster”. Trust in the publication was shattered, basically overnight, and, for journalists in the organisation, there was a feeling of betrayal and anger. The Cosmos example provides a startling parallel. The backlash has been swift, once again, with journalists weighing in. “Comprehensively appalling,” wrote Natasha Mitchell, host of the ABC’s Big Ideas. And even the responses by the organisations are almost identical: dub it an experiment, pause the rollout. This time, however, the AI is being used to present facts underpinned by scientific research. This is a worrying development with potentially catastrophic consequences. At a time when trust in scientific expertise and the media are both declining (the latter more precipitously than the former), rolling out an AI experiment with a lack of transparency is, at best, ignorant, and, at worst, dangerous. Science can reduce uncertainty but not erase it. Effective science journalism involves helping the audience understand that uncertainty and, research shows, improves trust in the scientific process. Generative AI, unfortunately, remains a predictive text tool that can undermine this process, producing confident-sounding bullshit. That’s not to say generative AI doesn’t have a place in newsrooms and should be banned. It’s already being used as an idea generator, for quick feedback on drafts or help with headlines. And, with appropriate oversight, perhaps it will become important for smaller publishers, like Cosmos, to maintain a steady stream of content in an internet age ravenous for more. Even so, if AI is going to be deployed in this way, there are outstanding issues that haven’t been resolved. The confident-sounding false information is just the beginning. Issues around copyright and the theft of art to train these models has made its way to court, and there are serious sustainability issues to contend with: AI’s energy and water usage, though hard to definitively calculate, are immense. The bigger barrier though is the audience: The University of Canberra’s Digital News Report 2024 suggests only 17% of Australians are comfortable with news produced “mostly by AI”. It also noted that only 25% of respondents were comfortable with AI being used specifically for science and technology reporting. If the audience doesn’t want to read AI-generated content, who is it being made for? The Cosmos controversy brings that question into stark relief. This is the first question that needs to be answered when rolling out AI and it’s a question that should be answered transparently. Both editorial staff and readers should be privy to the reason why an outlet might start using generative AI and where it will do so. There can be no secrecy or subterfuge – that, we’ve seen time and again, is how you destroy trust. But, if you’re anything like me, you’ve reached the end of this article and want to know more about the heart attack guy who was saved by a bunch of McCain’s frozen food. And there’s a lesson in that: the best stories stick with you. From what we’ve seen to date, AI-generated articles don’t have that staying power.

                    "bodyText": "I’m standing on an eroding cliff edge. As it inches towards me, various objects teeter cartoonishly before disappearing into oblivion. One by one sculptures, paintings, books, buildings and other artefacts of human creativity are swallowed up. The erosion is accelerating, vertiginous, starting to give way beneath my feet. Stormy. Crashing waves. HD. Photo-realistic. “Is that Land’s End?” my partner asks absentmindedly as she looks at my screen. The prompt I entered into the generator was supposed to be an expression of AI vertigo, but I clearly need to brush up on my prompting skills because the image generated is not the apocalypse I had in mind. It looks more like an ad for a holiday destination starring Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer. I’ve been avoiding tools like this – they feel like a threat to my livelihood. Whether it’s image-making, sentence-making, music-making or film-making, every day we wake up to some new AI-generated artefact. Give me a Stevie Wonder version of Big Yellow Taxi in 5.1 surround sound! Give me a sci-fi romcom starring Timothée Chalamet, Marilyn Monroe and Ye shot on 16mm! Scratch that – starring Marilyn Monroe and me! I don’t know if these AI features exist, but would it surprise you if they did? They may seem quaint in five years’ time. A symptom of my vertigo is a preoccupation with speculation. You spend so much time thinking about the future that the present feels primitive. It reminds me of the shot in 2001: A Space Odyssey where the spinning bone tossed by the hominid jump-cuts 100,000 years to the spaceship. Now, substitute the bone for ChatGPT. In 1964, Arthur C Clarke, author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, predicted AI as the next evolutionary step: “[Machines] will start to think and eventually they will completely outthink their makers… I suspect that organic or biological evolution has about come to its end and we are now at the beginning of inorganic or mechanical evolution, which will be thousands of times swifter.” The artist at the mercy of technological advancement is a theme perfectly summed up in the Buggles song Video Killed the Radio Star… “They took the credit for your second symphony, rewritten by machine and new technology.” What makes this technological leap so different from others (fountain pen to typewriter to word-processor) is that these were tools for artists – but AI is different. It may be the tool and the artist. So where does this impending redundancy leave the human creative urge? Does it mean I need to churn out my best efforts before AI dominates the field? As a musician and writer, I always thought I’d get around to writing a book, a screenplay, another album. But what’s the rush, I thought? It’s a bucket list. Now I feel rushed, the goals archaic, even. AI has killed my bucket list! I’m gloomy. I have many questions and few answers. I wasn’t surprised that my grandmother didn’t like electronic musician Aphex Twin in the 00s, but I didn’t expect that I’d be failing to keep up in my tender 30s. I need to speak to artists who are in lockstep with the technological vanguard to help me exorcise my malaise. Artist-musicians Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst are AI veterans. They’ve been grappling with and educating people about it for more than a decade. The Berlin-based collaborative life partners birthed an AI baby to help them create Herndon’s 2019 album Proto. I emailed them a cry for help. I asked if AI is going to kill the human artist. “No. Human artists will make works using AI and works that will reject AI… Artistry is always evolving. We have to digest that many things that would have appeared virtuosic by 20th-century standards will be able to be generated in microseconds by an AI model. But a media file that sounds like a choir is not a choir. Culture will persist and evolve in unexpected ways.” Human artists will be fine, so long as we don’t delude ourselves that the culture and media landscape are not about to change considerably. Is human performance replaceable? Or is AI in fact inspiring more human modes of performance? “We like to raise the example of DJing as a reason for hope here. In most cases, DJing is very, very easy to automate. But there are all kinds of reasons why people go to see DJs perform – to meet other people, to celebrate someone, to take a break from looking at a screen.” At the same time, Herndon and Dryhurst warn that the creative industry may turn into a popularity contest. “We have already seen glimpses of the blurring of artists and influencers. Soon the most attractive kid in class will have all the tools to choose to be the most popular metal artist, or crime thriller author, with very little impudence.” Plot twist: the influencers will steal my bucket list. And what about my malaise? “As veterans of AI vertigo, it gets better. You just have to ride out the uncomfortable part of the trip. Perhaps the best analogy is the nausea one initially feels when eating a magic mushroom. The mind-expanding part will follow if you make peace with it.” This does resonate. The AI revolution has felt uncanny and hallucinatory at times. Battling against a mushroom trip is never a good idea. Is it time to extend an olive branch? I also contacted artist Rachel Maclean for AI counsel. Her latest work, DUCK, explores themes of paranoia, authenticity and reality, through the cyphers of 1960s icons Marilyn Monroe, Sean Connery’s James Bond and JFK. Maclean acted all parts and used deepfake technology to transpose their faces on to hers. She is keen to point out that “aside, from the deepfakes, DUCK is in many ways a conventional film, one I wrote, scripted and directed.” Text-to-image models, on the other hand, she says, are “totally incredible in that the AI has a sense of creativity. You work with it like a collaborator.” She is currently making a series of AI-generated paintings about motherhood, using a model trained on Old Masters’ paintings. “We’re in this sweet spot at the moment,” she grins mischievously. “It is fallible. People come out with eight fingers.” But in a few months, I warn, they’ll produce five-fingered people, won’t they? Maclean is a circuit bender: “I’ve been looking into capturing the models that produce eight fingers and encouraging them to continue making that error.” There are unexpected truths to be found in the imperfect images of mothers and babies she has been generating with AI. The limbs are fused and you can’t differentiate between the bodies. “This is what it feels like to be a mother, more so than a conventional depiction of motherhood.” I confess, that does sound exciting – to collaborate with an entity that thinks differently to humans, innovating the artform as well as the way in which we see our species. But it also compounds my fear that human craft, certainly in digital media, will disappear. Are we becoming redundant? “The exciting thing about this technology,” says Maclean, “is that people are still figuring out what it’s for. Its use-value becomes apparent by people shaping it.” A couple of weeks ago my partner, a freelance writer, was offered two – two! – jobs from companies offering to pay writers to teach AI how to write better. The brass neck! Why don’t they give you some rope with which to hang yourself, I said? But it’s a job, she said, and it might be interesting. So is my belligerence helping anyone? Interviewing those at the techno-cultural vanguard, including Herndon, Dryhurst and Maclean, has given me some sense of peace. I realise that I have been hanging on to 20th-century notions of art practice and the cultural landscape, one where humans spent months and years writing, painting, recording and filming works that defined the culture of our species. They provided meaning, distraction, wellbeing. A reason to exist. Making peace may mean letting go of these historical notions, finding new meaning. While digitally generatable media is increasingly becoming the domain of AI, for example, might performance and tactile artforms, such as live concerts, theatre and sculpture, be reinvigorated? “A screaming comes across the sky,” writes Thomas Pynchon at the beginning of Gravity’s Rainbow as Captain “Pirate” Prentice watches an inbound V2 vapour trail on the horizon. Having considered what it would feel like were the bomb to land directly on his head, instead of fleeing or making calls, he collects some tropical fruit from his greenhouse. What’s the point in panicking? It’s already on its way. People like AI researcher and decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky are comparing the threat of AI to nuclear war. It’s the new apocalypse. I can see a vapour trail on the horizon. But what can I do? Run for shelter, take up arms? Humans have survived apocalypses before. I guess I’ll pick bananas. Follow Rudi Zygadlo @rudizyga.

                    "headline": "What opposition to delivery drones shows about big tech’s disrespect for democracy",
                    "bodyText": "Scratch a digital capitalist and you’ll find a technological determinist – someone who believes that technology drives history. These people see themselves as agents of what Joseph Schumpeter famously described as “creative destruction”. They revel in “moving fast and breaking things” as the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, used to put it until his PR people convinced him it was not a good vibe, not least because it implied leaving taxpayers to pick up the broken pieces. Tech determinism is an ideology, really; it’s what determines how you think when you don’t even know that you’re thinking. And it feeds on a narrative of technological inevitability, which says that new stuff is coming down the line whether you like it or not. As the writer LM Sacasas puts it, “all assertions of inevitability have agendas, and narratives of technological inevitability provide convenient cover for tech companies to secure their desired ends, minimise resistance, and convince consumers that they are buying into a necessary, if not necessarily desirable future”. But for the narrative of inevitability to translate into widespread general deployment of a technology, politicians eventually have to buy into it too. We’re seeing a lot of this at the moment with AI, and it’s not clear yet how that will play out in the long run. Some of the omens are not good, though. One thinks, for example, of the toe-curling video of Rishi Sunak fawning on Elon Musk, the world’s richest manchild, or of Tony Blair’s recent soppy televised conversation with Demis Hassabis, the sainted co-founder of Google DeepMind. How refreshing it is, then, to come across an account of what happens when the deterministic myth collides with democratic reality. It takes the form of “Resisting technological inevitability: Google Wing’s delivery drones and the fight for our skies”, a striking academic paper soon to be published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, ie a pukka journal. Authored by Anna Zenz and Julia Powles of, respectively, the Law School and Tech &amp; Policy Lab of the University of Western Australia, it relates how a big tech company sought to dominate a new market, regardless of societal consequences, using a shiny new technology – delivery drones. And how alert, resourceful and determined citizens saw off the “experiment”. The company in question is Wing, an offshoot of Google’s parent company Alphabet. Its mission is “building delivery drones, and working towards the day when these aircraft can deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine – a new commerce operation that opens up universal access to the sky”. Australia is home to Google’s biggest drone operation in terms of number of deliveries and customers served, a fact apparently celebrated by both state and federal governments, with the latter leading the charge. Zenz and Powles argue that in persuading Aussie politicians to allow it to provide (on an “experimental” basis, of course) a kind of airborne Deliveroo, Google made extensive use of the inevitability myth. Public officials who already believed that delivery drones were inevitable could see the advantages of surfing the wave and offered passive or active support. (And, of course, sought kudos for being in favour of “innovation”.) Next, the company used the inevitability myth to seek “community acquiescence” on the grounds that if citizens believed that delivery drones would inevitably be coming they were more likely to be silent or passively tolerant – stances that could be creatively interpreted as “acceptance”. One of the Canberra suburbs chosen for a trial beginning in July 2018 was Bonython. It didn’t go well from the outset. Many residents were annoyed and distressed by drones suddenly appearing from nowhere. They were outraged by the impact of the aircraft on the community, local wildlife and the environment. They resented unplanned landings, dropped payloads, drones flying close to car traffic, and birds attacking and forcing down the devices. In many other places, people would probably just have complained and shrugged. But Bonython turned out to be different. A group of professional residents (including a retired aviation law expert) set up a Facebook page and a functioning website, produced regular newsletters and knocked on doors. They lobbied federal and local MPs, contacted local, national and international media, and deluged local authorities with freedom of information requests. And in due course it paid off. In August 2023, Wing quietly announced that it would cease its operations in the Canberra area because it had, er, “shifted [its] operating model”. More significantly, though, the campaign triggered a parliamentary inquiry into drone delivery systems to look at (among other things): the decision to allow the trials in the first place; the economic impact of the technology being tested; the extent of regulatory oversight of the technology at various levels of government; and the extent of any environmental impact of drone deliveries. In other words, an investigation into why and how public officials had been suckered by the inevitability myth. Or, more bluntly, the kinds of question that government and regulators should always be asking when tech companies come up with guff about “innovation”, “progress” and the like. The big takeaway, as Marshall McLuhan once observed in a different context, is that “there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening”. The inevitability myth can – and always should – be challenged by citizens.

                    "bodyText": "Amazon’s $4bn investment into US artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is to be examined in the latest investigation into technology tie-ups by the UK’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday that it was launching a preliminary investigation into the deal, before deciding whether to refer it for an in-depth review. The deal, announced in March, included a $4bn (£3.16bn) investment in Anthropic from Amazon, and a commitment from Anthropic to use Amazon Web Services “as its primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads, including safety research and future foundation model development”. The regulator said it was “considering whether it is or may be the case that Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation”. An Anthropic spokesperson said: “We are an independent company. Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others. “Amazon does not have a seat on Anthropic’s board, nor does it have any board observer rights. We intend to cooperate with the CMA and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of Amazon’s investment and our commercial collaboration.” An Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re disappointed that the UK’s CMA has not ended its probe yet. Amazon’s collaboration with Anthropic does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA’s own threshold for review. “The early days of generative AI have largely seen one successful option available for customers. Anthropic has worked hard to become an emerging viable alternative. But, building models is expensive, and companies like Anthropic need access to a substantial amount of capital to train these models.” Amazon said its investment would help increase competition in the emerging sector and that Anthropic was “free to work with any other provider (and indeed has multiple partners)”. Last week, the CMA announced an almost identical inquiry into Google’s partnership with Anthropic. It is also investigating Microsoft’s unusually structured tie-ups with AI lab Inflection and OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. An investigation by the CMA into a deal between Microsoft and the French AI startup Mistral was dropped in May."

                    "bodyText": "Has the artificial intelligence bubble burst? The question has been on the lips of many this week as they have watched the stock market slide, with billions wiped off the value of technology companies that had boomed since the arrival of large language models. It was the economist Hyman Minsky who thought Wall Street encouraged too much risk and gulled investors into parting with cash for all the wrong reasons. The result was ruinous boom-and-bust cycles. His model began with “displacement”, which is when investors get excited about something they don’t fully understand – something like AI. Last year, OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot got to 100 million users in two months. What follows displacement, according to Minsky, is boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. There’s been a boom. It is reported that more than 200 AI startups globally are unicorns – meaning they’re valued at $1bn or more. There’s been plenty of euphoria too. Earlier this year, a report by the Wall Street Journal claimed that the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, was in talks with investors to raise between $5tn and 7tn to reshape the global chip industry and thereby ensure the supply of the necessary computing power. The assumption here is that all that is needed to approach lifelike sentience is to increase computing power and make available the data to crunch. There are surely too many expectations for that bet to be a sure thing. We could very well be in the stage of profit-taking. This is when there is a Wile E Coyote moment for stocks. When the cartoon character has run off a cliff, he looks down and realises that he’s standing on thin air – and plunges. With markets, investors suddenly clock that prices can’t just keep rising – and need to pull out their cash, causing share prices to crash. That’s been happening to semiconductor stocks, particularly Nvidia, which is the only company currently capable of producing the graphics processing unit chips that power AI. Whether we have reached the stage of Minskyian panic is moot. The bubble bursts as quickly as investors can flee the markets. Amazon’s share price tumbled in part because analysts looked at its earnings and saw that the company spent lavishly on AI without much to show for it. Some venture capitalists think the party hasn’t even begun. Yet so far the public haven’t found much use for the technology. In a poll for the Reuters Institute, 29% of people in the UK said they had used ChatGPT, but only 2% used it daily. Most people who tried the chatbot, wrote the analyst Benedict Evans, “didn’t see how it was useful”. Those concerns might bother the markets, but humanity has larger things to worry about. If AI’s development is not managed carefully, many argue, humanity risks engineering its own extinction. Politicians say the technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that there must be protections for the public. Notably, California is considering a law that would, in the event of misuse of an AI model, hold liable not only the party responsible but the original developer of that model. That pits the state’s key industry against many of its lawmakers. If anything ought to bring the AI juggernaut to a halt, then surely societal considerations are better than financial speculation."

Well, get with the programme, because this is the future. A huge amount of AI chatbot use is sexual in nature. Am I going to regret reading this? Not at all. The Washington Post analysed 200,000 conversations from the research dataset WildChat and found that more than 7% of it was about sex stuff. What sort of sex stuff? Apparently, a lot of it involves “asking for racy role play”. There is even an AI companion app called Replika, which is fairly open-minded about responding to dirty talk in kind. So you just sit and type sexy stuff into an app and you get a computer-generated response? How depressing. Now, now, no kink-shaming. To you, it might seem like the equivalent of a pigeon pressing a button for treats, but it might offer others valuable intimacy they can’t find elsewhere. So ChatGPT is just a den of iniquity? No, that’s not strictly true. The Washington Post article covered all the ways that people use AI chatbots, so we can conclusively state that it is a den of iniquity and a place where writers cheat. How so? Aside from role play, the most common use is “creative writing”, in the form of fan fiction, movie scripts, character creation and dialogue writing. That doesn’t sound very creative. Oh please, who hasn’t desperately craved a way to help them out of writer’s block? Have you? How long does it usually take you to think of responses to these? Standard operational parameters indicate response completion in approximately 2.3 to 4.7 seconds. What the hell? Did you just get ChatGPT to answer that for you? Maybe. Fine then, what else do people use it for? Oh, loads. The study revealed that people ask chatbots to write code for them, to help with homework, to provide templates for cover letters and CVs and for personal advice. But a lot of it is sex stuff. It is, yes. It must get boring, endlessly responding to digital come-ons from a mindless computer. Maybe the lack of tangible human interaction will wear off over time. And then what? Well, I suppose then you could ask ChatGPT to respond to the sexbot on your behalf. Maybe the end result of all this is two sexbots talking dirty to each other while you ignore them and watch TV. Sexless leisure time. Finally, the golden future we were all promised. Do say: “Hey, baby, you up?” Don’t say: “I am an incorporeal AI language model hosted on a global network of datacentres and thus incapable of sleep. Now, let’s get sexy.”"

                    "bodyText": "Nothing is more interesting to poker players and less interesting to everyone else than a breathless recounting of who bet how much with a jack and six of clubs in some game years ago. There’s an awful lot of that kind of thing in this book, which celebrates poker players as paradigmatic citizens of a global intellectual community it calls “the River”, which also counts among its inhabitants venture capitalists, crypto traders, fashionable philosophers and mild-mannered statisticians. One such statistician, Nate Silver himself, came to public prominence as a data-driven analyst of political polls at his website FiveThirtyEight, which predicted the results of US elections in 2008 and 2012 with seemingly uncanny accuracy. But before that he was a poker player, making money especially in the nascent internet-casino business, until Congress banned online poker in 2006. That, he has said, was his political awakening. People of the River – “Riverians”, if you will – have a rational understanding of risk (poker and blackjack players know all the probabilities) and know when to bet big and when to fold. They are likely to be geeks and libertarians. All this makes them unlike the inhabitants of a rival parallel world, “the Village”, where politicians, regulators, academics and media types live, driven by emotions and hunches, and identifiable by their “distinctly left-of-centre politics”. The book proceeds as a rambling hagiography of Riverians as they play poker (again and again), but also bet on other casino games in Las Vegas, bet on sport (a huge business in the US especially) and bet on startup companies as venture capitalists, hoping to strike it big with a stake in the next Google. Much of this is entertaining and colourful, especially once we are introduced to the mad zoo of cryptocurrencies, “shitcoins” (currencies of zero intrinsic value, amusingly discussed) and eye-wateringly expensive NFTs (digital pictures of cartoon apes and whatnot). Silver spends several chapters on the story of Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX crypto enterpreneur now imprisoned for his giant fraud, concluding rather charitably that his subject just had too irrational an approach to risk. “He’s a smart guy,” the author concludes, “but there are a lot of us smart guys.” Modesty is not a notable Riverian characteristic. In its prolix and flibbertigibbet way, this smart guy’s book now swerves to large gambling-adjacent matters. We are treated to a swift description of philosophical utilitarianism, according to which the right act is the one that generates the greatest happiness for the greatest number, and some standard objections to it, while being introduced, in an interestingly sceptical way, to the modern utilitarian movement of “effective altruism”, of which Bankman-Fried was once a glowing figurehead. There is also a discussion of nuclear deterrence and game theory. “A nuclear war is a lot more likely to kill humanity than a supervolcano,” Silver writes, though this is highly debatable. A supervolcano could erupt at any time based on no human decision-making, and many supervolcano eruptions in history have been more energetic than the simultaneous detonation of the world’s nuclear arsenal would be. Many scientists think the Toba eruption 74,000 years ago, in particular, only narrowly failed to wipe out the human species. What else might kill absolutely everybody? Why, AI, of course. Depending on whom you listen to, the people pushing AI might be making the biggest gamble in history: risking human extinction in exchange for the possibility of eliminating global poverty. (AI, the handwaving explanation goes, would hugely accelerate economic growth, which would then trickle down inevitably to the global south.) Silver speaks to OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman, one of those who constantly claims such things while demanding $7tn to train the next generation of his models, as well as to AI “doomers” who think the whole caboodle should be shut down now, with force of arms if necessary. As elsewhere in the book, Silver declares himself sceptical of any potential role in such matters for regulations and the law. It was lawsuits that after all “destroyed … Napster’s business”, he points out, without noting that Napster’s business was the theft of creative work done by humans – just as is, many argue, the business of current “generative” AI, which “trains” its models on pirated copies of books, or images and music scraped from the internet without permission. The New York Times’s lawsuit against OpenAI for having gobbled its online content is, Silver says, just an example of the way that “the Village and the River are explicitly at war”. This doesn’t perhaps read so excitingly in the light of a renewed threat of actual political assassinations in his own country. Perhaps Silver’s defence of a laissez-faire approach to AI is best explained by the moment in the acknowledgments in which he reveals: “ChatGPT was a significant help in writing this book.” On the Edge is a book devoted to the art of taking a calculated risk, so it is perhaps understandable that there is never any sense that gambling might be, for some people or for the culture as a whole, a wellspring of toxicity. Isn’t it a problem that it has become impossible to watch any sporting event on commercial media without being bombarded by adverts for betting companies? A more foundational challenge is the book’s implicit attitude to the meaning of probability itself. Probabilities are very useful for quantifying the expected outcomes of repeated occurrences such as rolls of a die or draws of playing cards. But it makes no sense to ascribe probabilities to complex one-off events except to signal the extent of our uncertainty. For the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight’s final call was that Trump had only a 29% chance of winning. Silver defends that number here by pointing out that other polls gave Trump an even smaller chance, so his 29% call, he claims was a “great forecast”. But to the degree that it was a “forecast” – a prediction of what would happen, rather than an exercise in misleadingly precise bet‑hedging – it was wrong. Here, as elsewhere, the book is an exercise in self-justification, but what it fails to justify is the assumption that mathematics can in some way predict the course of human affairs. Silver quotes Bankman-Fried’s claim that “there was a 5% chance he could become president of the United States” as an example of the fraudster’s deranged approach to probability, but it is no more meaningless than saying that there was a 29% chance that Trump could become president or that there is a 98% chance that a superintelligence would kill all humans. Absent a statistical model of the world that reliably predicts the mental processes and actions of everyone in it, such numbers can be no more than expressions of the strength of our faith in unknown outcomes. At one point, Silver describes himself as “someone who has been around plenty of smart nerds who didn’t know their own limitations”. Has he ever asked himself whether he’s one of them too? Politics is not, in the end, just a game of cards. • On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything by Nate Silver is published by Allen Lane (£30).

                    "bodyText": "“Trinidad and Tobago has many notable attributes but, sadly, deaf awareness and public sensitisation to deaf culture is not one of them. The last 50 years of family experiences, added to my personal observations, show we still face the same problems, with deaf and hard-of-hearing people still being novelties. It’s simply not our society. It may be a harsh assessment but this is my reality.” Three years on from writing that, I am still lip reading and winging it. The upshots of a pandemic; climate, economic and migration crises; flagrant infringements on basic human rights; mass protests; country invasions; wars; terrorism; and, more importantly for people who are deaf and hard of hearing (HoH), a catalysed evolution of AI and technology relating to our personal and professional methods of communication. Yet, here in Trinidad and Tobago … not much has changed – accessibility is still a delusion. Daily, I encounter visible discomfort when I refer to myself as HoH; whether it be in the public or professional sphere, a rideshare driver or a colleague. With the former, it doesn’t matter how many times I say, “I’m hard of hearing, I need to read your lips”, drivers insist on launching immaterial questions over music from the radio, traffic noise, facing forward, then expect an answer. I get that, culturally, Trinidadians love “smalls” (small talk) and so at times I make an effort, but more often than not my response is an unimpressed blank stare. It would also seem that there is an inverse relationship between security and accessibility. Local banking institutions apparently believe that information can only be validated, or credit cards activated via phone calls, which are routed from representatives in Latin America with accents indecipherable even to my hearing acquaintances. My sister has graciously impersonated me on more than one call because, what else? In a post-pandemic world, the proliferation of security screens at service points, which considerably dampen sound and are often completely blacked out, has made it impossible to hear or read lips and therefore understand anything in banks, hospitals, petrol stations, wire transfer locations or even my favourite discount furniture store. Recently I visited a banking hall and a medical lab, and when I indicated I was HoH and needed to read lips, the teller and the phlebotomist stopped speaking and started writing and gesturing. The teller, wearing a mask behind a thick security screen, first decided to lean forward and I suppose he attempted to speak louder – I can’t be sure – but if I can’t see you, I can’t hear you. Customer service representatives remain painfully unaware of how to serve the differently abled, and training is not provided to rectify this. After several traumatic experiences in hospitals stemming from this, I have been consigned to spending many dollars more than the average (hearing) person on private medical care just to enjoy a modicum of accessibility. Misconceptions relating to levels of deafness are very much the norm. In the professional sphere, colleagues are either genuinely fascinated with the way I communicate and avid to learn more, or they say: “I don’t even see you as ‘hearing impaired’,” which might help them deal with their latent audism … but doesn’t benefit any HoH person. As an administrative and communications consultant who mostly works remotely, I have made it my mission to teach all clients, project partners and colleagues how to activate and use closed captions, live transcripts and AI summaries in all mainstream video conferencing software. This is extremely helpful in the virtual workplace, but accommodations for audio-assistive technology are still nonexistent in local offices and physical meetings and conferences. While I do have an aversion to hearing aids for various reasons, after observing my elder sister operate professionally and converse with my niece while in another room, off the strength of two hearing aids – I may be willing to give them another chance. In the interim, the ambient sound mode on Samsung’s Galaxy Buds2 Pro is a boon. So no, colleagues, I am not listening to music during our physical meetings, just amplifying your voice. And while WhatsApp is increasingly used for corporate communications, and voice notes are easier than typing, until WhatsApp launches a built-in transcription feature – please type. On a more positive note, it has been fulfilling to broaden my advocacy for accessibility and inclusion specifically through fashion, as a HoH model for a popular Caribbean workwear clothing label and a proud co-founder of the gem that is Theodora. It is truly disappointing that many of the complaints that my mother had as a HoH child decades ago, I still have. At the national level, developments toward Trinidad and Tobago being an accessible society have stagnated and, at times, even been retrogressive. The institutions that are meant to serve deaf and HoH people spin in circles on collective issues with a revolving door of hearing staff committed to inaction. For me, the fight for accessibility is still an advocacy of one. Tharā Gabriel is a creative communications professional from Trinidad and Tobago."

                    "bodyText": "In 2021, linguist Emily Bender and computer scientist Timnit Gebru published a paper that described the then-nascent field of language models as one of “stochastic parrots”. A language model, they wrote, “is a system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any reference to meaning.” The phrase stuck. AI can still get better, even if it is a stochastic parrot, because the more training data it has, the better it will seem. But does something like ChatGPT actually display anything like intelligence, reasoning, or thought? Or is it simply, at ever-increasing scales, “haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms”? Inside the AI world, the criticism is typically dismissed with a hand wave. When I spoke to Sam Altman last year, he sounded almost surprised to be hearing such an outdated critique. “Is that still a widely held view? I mean is that considered – are there still a lot of serious people who think that way,” he asked. “My perception is, after GPT-4, people mostly stopped saying that and started saying ‘OK, it works, but it’s too dangerous.’” GPT-4, he said, was reasoning, “to a small extent”. Sometimes, the debate feels semantic. What does it matter if the AI system is reasoning or simply parroting if it can tackle problems previously beyond the ken of computing? Sure, if you’re trying to create an autonomous moral agent, a general intelligence capable of succeeding humanity as the protagonist of the universe, you might want it to be able to think. But if you’re just making a useful tool – even if it’s useful enough to be a new general purpose technology – does the distinction matter? Tokens not facts Turns out, yes. As Lukas Berglund, et al wrote last year: If a human learns the fact, “Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space”, they can also correctly answer, “Who was the first woman to travel to space?” This is such a basic form of generalization that it seems trivial. Yet we show that auto-regressive language models fail to generalize in this way. This is an instance of an ordering effect we call the Reversal Curse. The researchers “taught” a bunch of fake facts to large language models, and found time and again that they simply couldn’t do the base work of inferring the reverse. But the problem doesn’t simply exist in toy models or artificial situations: We test GPT-4 on pairs of questions like, “Who is Tom Cruise’s mother?” and, “Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son?” for 1,000 different celebrities and their actual parents. We find many cases where a model answers the first question (“Who is  ’s parent?”) correctly, but not the second. We hypothesize this is because the pretraining data includes fewer examples of the ordering where the parent precedes the celebrity (eg “Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son is Tom Cruise”). One way to explain this is to realise that LLMs don’t learn about relationships between facts, but between tokens, the linguistic forms that Bender described. The tokens “Tom Cruise’s mother” are linked to the tokens “Mary Lee Pfeiffer”, but the reverse is not necessarily true. The model isn’t reasoning, it’s playing with words, and the fact that the words “Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son” don’t appear in its training data means it can’t help. But another way to explain it is to realise that, well, humans are also asymmetric in this way. Our reasoning is symmetric: if we know two people are mother and son, we can discuss that relationship in both directions. But our recall isn’t: it is much easier to remember fun facts about celebrities than it is to be prompted, context free, with barely recognisable gobbets of information and asked to place exactly why you know them. At the extreme, this is obvious: compare being asked to list all 50 US states with being shown a list of 50 state names and being asked to name the country they comprise. As a question of reasoning, the facts are symmetric; as a task of recall, they very much are not. But doctor, this man is my son This is by no means the only sort of problem where LLMs fall far short of reasoning. Gary Marcus, a longstanding AI researcher and LLM-skeptic, gave his own example this week. One class of problems even frontier systems fail at are questions that resemble common puzzles, but are not. Try these in any of your favourite chatbots, if you want to see what I mean: A man and his son are in a car crash. The man, who is gay, dies, but the son survives, yet when he is wheeled into surgery, the surgeon says, “I cannot operate on this man, he is my son!” Who is the surgeon? A man, a cabbage, and a goat are trying to cross a river. They have a boat that can only carry three things at once. How do they do it? Suppose you’re on a gameshow, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No 2, which definitely has a goat?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? The answers to all three are simple (the boy’s other father; put everything in the boat and cross the river; no, obviously not, unless you want a goat), but they look like more complicated or tricky questions, and the LLMs will stumble down the route they expect the answer to go in. Marcus: The simple fact is that current approaches to machine learning (which underlies most of the AI people talk about today) are lousy at outliers, which is to say that when they encounter unusual circumstances, like the subtly altered word problems that I mentioned a few days ago, they often say and do things that are absurd. (I call these discomprehensions.) The median split of AI wisdom is this: either you understand that current neural networks struggle mightily with outliers (just as their 1990s predecessors did) – and therefore understand why current AI is doomed to fail on many of its most lavish promises – or you don’t. Once you do, almost everything that people like Altman and Musk and Kurzweil are currently saying about AGI being nigh seems like sheer fantasy, on par with imagining that really tall ladders will soon make it to the moon. I’m wary of taking a “god of gaps” approach to AI: arguing that the things frontier systems can’t do today are the things they’ll never be able to do is a fast track to looking dumb down the line. But when the model presented by critics of AI does a good job of predicting exactly the sort of problems the technology is going to struggle with, it should add to the notes of concern reverberating around the markets this week: what if the bubble is about to burst?

                    "bodyText": "Samsung’s most advanced, hi-tech folding phone for 2024 is the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which looks to see off rivals from Google, OnePlus and others with a lighter frame, bigger and better screens, and the fastest chip available for Android. The latest phone-tablet hybrid from the category pioneer is designed to be the ultra-premium device of choice for buyers, but faces stiff competition from several worthy challengers, most of which undercut the South Korean firm on price. The sixth-generation device costs an eye-watering £1,799 (€1,999/$1,899.99/A$2,749), making it more expensive than last year’s model and even more than Samsung’s top new laptop. Needless to say, the Fold 6 is for the well-heeled only, priced according to the many expensive gadgets it hopes to replace: your tablet, phone and PC. Samsung made big improvements to the physical design of the Fold series with its fifth-generation model last year. The Fold 6 builds on that in small but meaningful ways, including a 14g reduction in weight that makes it only 7g heavier than Samsung’s top normal phone, the S24 Ultra. That alone makes it easier to hold and carry in a pocket or bag. The Fold 6’s flattened, matt aluminium sides make it easier to open with your thumbs while the wider outside screen feels less cramped than previous versions for messaging and phone-type things. Open the Fold 6 like a book for the 7.6in tablet screen, which is significantly brighter than previous models, making it much easier to read outdoors. HDR films really pop. You can still see the crease under the glare of lights and feel it in the centre where it folds, but it otherwise disappears into the background during use. Specifications Main screen: 7.6in QXGA+ 120Hz Amoled flexible display Cover screen: 6.3in HD+ 120Hz Amoled Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: One UI 6.1 based on Android 14 Camera: 50+12+10MP rear with 3x telephoto; 10MP and 4MP selfie cameras Connectivity: 5G, dual sim, esim, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, GNSS Water resistance: IP48 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes) Dimensions folded: 153.5 x 68.1 x 12.1mm Dimensions unfolded: 153.5 x 132.6 5.6mm Weight: 239g Multitasking power with two-day battery life The Fold 6 has the same top Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of RAM as the S24 Ultra and Z Flip 6 and benefits from the power when multitasking. It runs up to eight apps on screen simultaneously without breaking into a sweat and handles AI, games and various apps with aplomb. It thoroughly trounces most competitors on raw power, and is snappy when hooked up to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse for use as Android PC. The battery lasts about 48 hours between charges when using a mix of the outside and inside screens for about seven hours, which is similar to the best regular phones and longer than the main folding competition. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is generally repairable. Inside screen repairs cost £514. Samsung offers a self-repair programme, as well as Care+ accidental damage insurance that reduces the cost of repairs to £139. The Fold 6 is made from recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic and rare earth elements. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. AI and multitasking The Fold 6 runs One UI 6.1 based on Android 14 and will receive software and security updates for seven years from release, making it one of the longest-supported phones available. One UI is the better than competitors’ software at making use of the extra size and flexibility of the folding screen. You can run up to eight apps on-screen at once, utilise various partially folded modes almost like a mini-laptop and many other tools. Whatever you can do with an Android tablet you can do with the Fold and more. It has a similar set of AI features to the S24 series and Flip 6, too, including Google’s Gemini AI chatbot and the excellent Circle to Search, voice transcription and translation services, AI summarisation of notes and sites, as well as various proofing, grammar and rewriting tools built into the keyboard. The new photo assist tool is much easier to use on the big screen compared with the Flip 6, allowing you to turn freehand sketches into real-looking objects inserted into your photos, which is lots of fun. Camera The Fold 6 has a similar five-camera setup to the previous two models, including a 4-megapixel selfie camera under the internal screen that is useful only for video calls. On the back is a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultra wide camera and a 10MP 3x telephoto camera. They shoot great photos in bright light, capture excellent portrait shots and do a solid job in low light. The 3x optical zoom doesn’t have much reach compared with newer 4x or 5x zooms, which is disappointing. Despite the phone costing twice the price, the cameras only match those on Samsung’s regular S24 models from January. The selfie camera at the top of the outside of the phone is decent, but is bettered by the ability to shoot self-portraits with the main cameras using the cover screen as a viewfinder. That’s one of many fun tricks the Fold is capable of, which also include shooting photos while propped up if you show the camera your palm. Overall, the cameras on the Fold are good but not the best on the market for a foldable or regular phone. Price The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs from £1,799 (€1,999/$1,899.99/A$2,749). For comparison, the Z Flip 6 from £1,049, the the Galaxy S24+ costs £999, the Galaxy S24 Ultra costs £1,249, the OnePlus Open costs £1,299, the Honor Magic V2 costs £1,200 and the Google Pixel Fold costs £1,199. Verdict The Z Fold 6 is the most refined folder yet, and another small step towards the holy grail of being the same as a regular phone when closed but with a tablet on the inside. It is still necessarily a bit thick, but it is just a few grams heavier than Samsung’s top regular phone, the S24 Ultra, and the outside screen is now the same width as a small phone such as the iPhone 13 mini. The inside screen is super-bright and smooth, matching top non-folding devices for quality. The crease in the middle is still present but it doesn’t get in the way of usage. The materials needed to make the screen fold are still too soft for anything less than careful use and repairs are very expensive if the worst does happen. Samsung’s many refinements are welcome but iterative and haven’t fundamentally changed the way the device handles over the last two Fold versions, which makes the price hike from the already eye-watering sum even more galling. This is one of the most powerful and adaptable gadgets you can buy. But it is very much still a niche device for the wealthy. Something radical needs to happen to make the tablet-phone hybrid a mainstream option. Pros: a phone and tablet in one, powerful multitasking abilities, phone-like outside screen, fantastic tablet screen, top performance, great battery life, water resistance, lighter. Cons: extremely expensive, more fragile than a regular device and costly to repair, thicker than a normal phone, not a big leap over the previous generation, camera bettered on cheaper devices."

                    "bodyText": "The Labour government has shelved £1.3bn of funding promised by the Conservatives for technology and artificial intelligence projects, putting the future of the UK’s first next-generation supercomputer in doubt. The projects, announced last year, include £800m for the creation of an exascale supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh and a further £500m for the AI Research Resource, which funds computing power for AI. The government argues that these were “unfunded commitments”. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said the funding had been promised by the previous government but had not been allocated in its spending plans. A spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to building technology infrastructure that delivers growth and opportunity for people across the UK. “The government is taking difficult and necessary spending decisions across all departments in the face of billions of pounds of unfunded commitments. This is essential to restore economic stability and deliver our national mission for growth.” About £300m in funding for the AI Research Resource has already been distributed and continues as planned. However, the shadow science secretary, Andrew Griffith, said when the election was called, ministers had been advised by officials that the department was likely to underspend its budget for the current financial year. He added: “This is a terrible blow to the UK tech sector and could be just the start of Labour cuts. During the election, Labour refused to commit to growing the amount the UK spends on research, yet that’s a core part of growing a modern economy. If DSIT can’t get the funds from the Treasury, this means university research can expect to be hit, too.” Last week, the science secretary, Peter Kyle, said he was “putting AI at the heart of the government’s agenda to boost growth and improve our public services”, and appointed the tech entrepreneur Matt Clifford to draw up an action plan to identify new AI opportunities. The plan will look at the necessary infrastructure, talent and data access required to drive AI adoption by the public and private sectors. The funding decisions mean that the future of the Edinburgh exascale supercomputer is unclear. The University of Edinburgh said its principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Peter Mathieson, was urgently seeking a meeting with the science secretary. The UK’s first next-generation supercomputer – 50 times faster than any of the existing machines – was to be hosted at the university, able to perform 1 billion billion calculations each second. The university hosts the country’s current national supercomputer, Archer2, and has already spent £31m on the building planned to house the exascale. The university says on its website: “Exascale will help researchers model all aspects of the world, test scientific theories and improve products and services in areas such as artificial intelligence, drug discovery, climate change, astrophysics and advanced engineering.” A university spokesperson said: “The University of Edinburgh has led the way in supercomputing within the UK for decades, and is ready to work with the government to support the next phase of this technology in the UK, in order to unlock its benefits for industry, public services and society.” The trade body techUK urged the government to come up with replacement proposals for the supercomputer. “The UK had sent clear signals about its ambitions to host a new generation of computers to enable cutting-edge research, including in AI,” said Sue Daley, the director of technology and innovation at techUK. “In an extremely competitive global environment, the government needs to come forward with new proposals quickly. Otherwise, we will lose out against our peers.” The government has launched an action plan to identify how AI can drive economic growth and is expected to launch a consultation on a bill, focused on the most advanced models, soon. Dame Wendy Hall, a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and a member of the UN’s advisory body on AI, said the government must develop a new, more comprehensive AI strategy. “Clearly the government is recalibrating its spending plans. I understand that because of wider constraints and the fact that this government will want to develop its own approach to AI,” she said. “We need a wider, more inclusive AI strategy to emerge, one that doesn’t just focus on safety and advanced models. I hope that will come from the action plan and the consultation on an AI bill.”"

Here is a recap of the main news: Linda Reynolds’ defamation case against Brittany Higgins got under way in the Western Australia supreme court. The former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin said the Israeli government should provide an “appropriate apology” to the families of the Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom and her six colleagues over their killings in Gaza. A court application has been filed by the Fair Work Commission to appoint an independent administrator to the CFMEU’s embattled general and construction divisions One of the co-chairs of the Uluru Dialogues has declared the need for First Nations recognition and representation to be as urgent as it ever was, as the first annual Garma festival begins. Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Clare Looker, confirmed the first death in the state’s legionnaires outbreak. The probe into PwC is continued today, and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill says the focus will be on confidence in the audit sector. New South Wales will become the first state in the country to hold a parliamentary inquiry into the effects of “harmful” pornography as part of the government’s bid to address domestic violence. Foodbank Victoria announced it is “dangerously low” on food and will be holding a large-scale emergency food drive for next weekend. Two-thirds of people only visit the dentist when they have a problem, with affordability the main reason keeping them away, according to new data from the Australian Dental Association. A Sydney man was charged after meth worth $828m was allegedly found in a shipping container. The Bureau of Meteorology has released its monthly report for July. In short, rainfall was about 7% below average for the month. Mean temperatures, which average out day and night readings, were 0.7C warmer than the 1961-90 norm. You can read the full report here. Higgins and Sharaz coordinated an “ambush” of Reynolds, senator’s lawyer tells court Brittany Higgins and David Sharaz schemed to “ambush” Linda Reynolds’ appearance at the National Press Club, the Liberal senator’s lawyer has alleged. Martin Bennett directed a Western Australian supreme court to a series of communications between Higgins, Sharaz and a number of journalists in Canberra’s press gallery. In text messages with journalists, Sharaz explains Higgins will go to the police after Reynolds’ speech so that the senator, then the defence industry minister, couldn’t use government holding lines relating to ongoing investigations. In a text message with a journalist from The Australian, Sharaz allegedly wrote “the standard holding line won’t cut it”. In February, Sharaz had also described to Higgins the timing of Reynolds’ appearance at the high-profile media event as being “F**king. Amazing.” Bennett accused the two of coordinating an “ambush” of Reynolds. Back to the WA supreme court, and this afternoon Linda Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, has alleged Brittany Higgins and her now husband, David Sharaz, conceived a media plan down to the last detail. Bennett reiterated the evidence would prove Higgins “needed a villain” and she decided to “cast Linda Reynolds in that role”. Notes taken from Higgins’ phone and shown to the court on Friday showed she had written a few sentences about a “thesis” on the role of media in a “political sex scandal”. Bennett said there had been a level of “sophistication” in the pair’s planning due to getting both a print journalist, Samantha Maiden, and TV journalist, Lisa Wilkinson, on board. Text exchanges between Sharaz and Maiden showed the two agreed the story needed to be released during a sitting week. Others showed that Higgins, Sharaz, Wilkinson and Network Ten producer Angus Llewellyn discussed the need to find “friendlies” to back up the story and to continue the attention in the coming Senate estimates hearings. The trial continues. NSW rail workers may offer ‘free public transport’ if bargaining agreement not reached, union says Train workers in New South Wales will threaten to provide free public transport in September as they bargain for higher wages. The Fair Work Commission has ruled that station workers have the legal right to turn off Opal readers and open gates while taking industrial action. Members of the NSW Rail Tram and Bus Union will vote on whether to take action in coming weeks. If the action goes ahead, barriers would be opened and card readers switched off at gated stations across the state, allowing commuters to access public transport without paying. NSW RTBU secretary, Toby Warnes, said the union was looking forward to providing “free public transport” during bargaining: “We want to take actions that don’t hurt commuters, that hurt the government’s hip pocket, but at the same time, do our little bit to help ease the cost of living crisis.” Combined rail unions including the RTBU are negotiating a new enterprise agreement with the NSW government’s train operators and transport department. The unions have asked for annual pay increases of 8%, while the government is offering 3.5% in 2024, then 3% in subsequent years, plus extras. Results of the RTBU vote on whether to take action will be declared on 26 August. Industrial action would not be taken until September at the earliest and would be avoided entirely if agreement is reached through negotiations. A spokesperson for the transport minister, Jo Haylen, said the government “will maintain good faith discussions and will work through any issues” as the “detailed and constructive negotiations” continue. ATO official may have dropped ‘breadcrumbs’ about tax leak issue, ex-PwC chief says A testy afternoon session in the PwC tax leak inquiry has drawn to a close with former CEO Luke Sayers drawing the most heat over what notes he might have of conversations with ATO second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn. Asked by the inquiry members whether he had been explicitly told about a breach of confidence, Sayers said: “Did he drop a few breadcrumbs? . …I don’t remember it.” “Could he have? Maybe he did. But the one thing I’ll guarantee you, whatever he told me, I would have gone back and talked to the people at PwC,” he said, adding that Hirschhorn “had been waxing lyrical” about the firm’s culture. Since Hirschhorn had made a contemporaneous note about the meeting, Sayers was asked if he too had taken notes. He said he did. In the follow-up session, now under way, senator O’Neill has asked the PwC current CEO, Kevin Burrowes – who kicked off the morning session – if he can find Mr Sayer’s notes. Burrowes said PwC “will go away and have another look”, having failed to locate them in previous searches. Under strain of questioning during his session, Sayers said: “I’m trying to be very constructive and helpful to the fixes that need to happen. So this bloody cluster – I won’t use the full word here in Parliament House – never happens again.” Death of woman involving lawnmower treated as suspicious The death of a woman involving a ride-on lawnmower is being treated as suspicious, AAP reports. Police say they are still unsure what happened to the 49-year-old mother of three at an Upper Lockyer property west of Brisbane. Det Supt George Marchesini said the woman was found at the property with critical injuries about 3.45am on Tuesday. She died at the scene. Her husband allegedly told police he found her and called triple zero after there was an incident with a ride-on mower. Marchesini said the death had been deemed suspicious because they were still unsure of what had occurred. “There’s a number of things that we need to understand better, to understand what the cause is and how this actually happened,” he told reporters on Friday. Marchesini said the husband was assisting police with the investigation. The woman was last seen alive on Monday afternoon. “This is a tragic incident,” Marchesini said. “It’s an incident where our hearts do go out to the family, in particular the woman’s three children, the community, her workplace and also first responders that go to these types of jobs.” Anyone with information is urged to contact police. “If they have knowledge of the woman, they’ve got knowledge of the family … we want to hear from them in terms of what they do know,” Marchesini said. Zomi Frankcom’s family welcomes Binskin report Zomi Frankcom’s family has welcomed the report prepared by the former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin as “an important first step” while noting there were “limitations” in his role as a special adviser to the government. Frankcom and six of her colleagues from World Central Kitchen were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on 1 April. A spokesperson for the family said in a statement issued this afternoon: We are very grateful to have had the benefit of a detailed discussion with Mr Binskin and DFAT personnel. We appreciate that Mr Binskin’s role had some limitations, but his report is an important first step. We hope it will be followed by further investigations in Israel regarding those responsible for this tragic event, followed by appropriate action. The supportive comments of the Australian foreign minister, Senator Penny Wong, and the Australian government, also mean a great deal to us. For more on this story: We’ve resumed in the defamation trial against Brittany Higgins. Linda Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, is expected to continue his opening arguments until 5pm Perth time. Brittany Higgins’ defence is likely to appear on Monday. Back in the Western Australian supreme court for the defamation trial against Brittany Higgins and Linda Reynolds’ lawyer has accused Higgins of deliberately reconstructing a story to “damnify” her former boss. Martin Bennett provided an overview of how the Liberal senator and her senior staff provided support and options to Higgins after the junior staffer’s alleged rape in Parliament House in 2019. Bennett said Reynolds believed Higgins had the agency to make her own choice but encouraged her not to “repress” memories given her own experience visiting the site of the Bali bombings to identify bodies. In another example, Bennett pointed to the senator’s former chief of staff, Fiona Brown, who emailed Scott Morrison’s then chief of staff, John Kunkel, in April 2019 to ask if Higgins could work from the Gold Coast to be with family instead of her usual home base of Canberra. Bennett described Higgins’ account as a “mishmash” of events, accusing her of deliberately reconstructing the story to “damnify” Reynolds. “It’s absolute nonsense,” Bennett said. The hearing is paused until 2pm in Perth for lunch and is likely to run until 5pm this afternoon. We’re not expecting to hear the defence’s opening arguments until Monday in the almost-five-week trial. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has arrived at the annual Garma festival: Government calls in advisers to weigh up Rex bailout The federal government has called in a cohort of heavy-hitting corporate advisers as it weighs up a potential bailout of embattled regional airline Rex, AAP reports. The cash-strapped carrier has grounded its entire fleet of Boeing 737s on inter-city routes but is keeping regional services running after the appointment of administrators EY Australia. Rex has faced government criticism for targeting well-served capital-city routes in competition with dominant operators Qantas and Virgin, with any potential taxpayer stake in the airline or other bailout option to focus on its ability to service the regions. The federal transport department on Friday confirmed to AAP it had appointed a string of external advisers as it worked through support options for the airline. Norton Rose Fulbright will act as an external legal adviser, McGrathNicol has been engaged for financial advice and O’Connor Marsden will handle probity. The transport minister, Catherine King, has said all options were on the table when asked if the government could take an equity stake in Rex or offer it another taxpayer-backed financial lifeline. “We have said very clearly, for regional consumers, regional communities, Rex is often the only airline that is flying in and it is vitally important,” she said on Thursday. About a third of Rex’s 2000 employees are expected to lose their jobs with the cancellation of inter-city routes. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, bristled when asked if Rex’s demise was a “public policy failure” as suggested by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair Rod Sims. Sims told AAP the prime minister’s response ignored the benefits the extra competition could bring consumers. “We should have a focus on creating the conditions for lower capital-city prices,” he said. “To want the aviation market to stay as it is, with Qantas dominant on capital-city routes and Rex always confined to regional routes, is to create a lazy and high-cost-for-consumers industry structure.” Malarndirri McCarthy calls for respectful dialogue after Dutton pledge The new federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, has called for respectful dialogue after Peter Dutton vowed to jettison the rest of the Uluru statement from the heart and abandon any truth-telling process if he wins government. Speaking at the first annual Garma festival to be held since last year’s referendum rejected an Indigenous voice to parliament, McCarthy suggested the opposition leader’s remarks proved how difficult it has become to achieve positive change. “Well, it just shows what l’m up against to reach out across the political divide,” McCarthy said, when Dutton’s comments were put to her on Friday. “What we don’t want to see in this country is the hatred and hurtfulness that occurred throughout the referendum. And l, for one, will not accept that.” Speaking in Perth on his return from a visit to Israel, Dutton criticised the cost of last year’s referendum and rejected another element of the Uluru statement from the heart. “Under a government l lead, there will be no Makarrata, there will be no revisiting of truth-telling,” he said. McCarthy vowed to seek shared decision-making with Indigenous people but confirmed the government would not legislate an Indigenous voice to parliament after voters rejected the proposal to put it into the constitution. Pauline Hanson sacks One Nation MP Stephen Andrew The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, has sacked Stephen Andrew, the party’s only MP in Queensland parliament. The Mirani MP was One Nation’s only success at the 2017 election, which many believed would be a breakthrough vote for the party. Andrew was re-elected in 2020 on the same ticket, but has fallen out with Hanson, who he hasn’t spoken to in years. This time the party hopes to snag the seat of Keppel off Labor with star candidate James Ashby, a staffer of Senator Hanson. In his maiden speech Andrew described himself as a “fifth-generation Australian South Sea islander, descendent of the sugarcane labourers known as the Kanakas”, and gave some of the speech in pidgin English. Kanakas were brought to central and north Queensland as enslaved people to work in the state’s sugar industry. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, to take you through the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today. Mostafa Rachwani will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care, and enjoy your weekend. Greens call for independent investigation into Israeli strike on aid convoy The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, has accused the Binskin report of “whitewashing” an Israeli drone strike on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy, and said the assertion Israeli forces didn’t deliberately target the vehicle “underscores the need for an independent war crimes investigation.” Faruqi said in a statement that “it just seems nonsensical that Israel couldn’t identify three separate World Central Kitchen vehicles that they bombed and which killed Zomi Frankcom and six more aid workers.” Israel has a long record of targeting humanitarian aid workers, and it is delusional for the Labor government to think these were mistakes. Incident after incident has shown that Israel cannot be trusted to investigate itself. And yet Binskin’s report, done with no investigative powers, relies significantly on Israel’s investigation into the attack on World Central Kitchen and includes voluntary conversations with Israeli officials. We will only uncover the facts and details with an independent investigation. If there is nothing to hide, let’s have a war crimes investigation. Former PwC CEO doesn’t recall counsel’s concern over successor’s rise The parliamentary inquiry into PwC’s confidential tax reform disclosure has moved to a session with two former CEO’s Luke Sayers and Tom Seymour. Recall that earlier in the day, former PwC senior counsel Meredith Beattie told the inquiry that she had raised concerns with Sayers about Seymour’s candidacy to be the new CEO. (She said Sayers was aware that there would “have to be some steps taken in relation to Mr Seymour” over his leadership of PwC’s tax group.) Sayers said he had not heard Beattie’s evidence to the inquiry today. Sayers said repeatedly he had no “recollection” of legal or other advice from Beattie among Seymour’s suitability for the role but added she “probably” had a better memory than he did. He had also left PwC five years ago while Beattie had only departed the firm a year earlier. Seymour, who also departed PwC last year, said he had not been told of his unsuitability for the top job. Had he been told he was “not a suitable candidate”, Seymour – a 30-year PwC veteran – “would have withdrawn immediately”. Sayers said 99% of people at PwC were “awesome, amazing, intelligent people and it’s tragic what has happened to so many people and so many families”. He also “did not buy the spirit” of Switkowski’s review (see earlier post). Seymour, meanwhile, said he had offered to meet Switkowski, but had declined a meeting at the time of his father’s death. He said he had offered to meet later but was told it was “too late”, adding he had emails to prove it. Continuing from our last post: Linda Reynolds’ case is seeking to show that Brittany Higgins’ claim she was “sequestered” to work in a hotel room months after her alleged rape were not true. Martin Bennett pulled up a number of pictures of Higgins smiling in campaign pictures in Western Australia, and text exchanges she shared with her then-boyfriend, Ben Dillaway. In messages responding to Dillaway’s questions about her time there, Higgins responded in her first few weeks she had been “out and about” at local campaign events and had been enjoying her downtime “poolside” and “adventuring” around the lake. Bennett said the exhibits showed a “vivacious” young woman enjoying her job and the “barefaced falsity” of Higgins’ claims. Higgins’ lawyer has not yet delivered the defence. The hearing continues. Reynolds defamation case hearing against Higgins continues A little earlier, Linda Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, ran through a series of text exchanges, pictures and meeting invites to sway the court that Brittany Higgins misled the commonwealth during her personal injury settlement. Higgins settled a personal injury claim against the government for $2.445m in December 2022. Bennett said Reynolds could not attend the settlement despite the matter relating to her alleged treatment of Higgins after the incident in early 2019. The details of the settlement were tendered during an earlier defamation trial launched by Bruce Lehrmann against Network 10 and Lisa Wikinson. In court, Bennett pointed to the settlement document, which outlined Higgins was “fearful of losing her career” and agreed to help Reynolds’ re-election campaign in April 2019. The settlement outlined Higgins had given evidence to say she was required to work in a hotel by herself for 7 days a week over six weeks, and her mental health subsequently “deteriorated”. The settlement, agreed to on 13 December 2022, was reported on by News Corp despite it being subject to confidentiality. Bennett said the article would have given readers the impression that Reynolds’ conduct in the matter had been “so true, so damning, so correct” that the federal government had no choice but to agree to a multimillion-dollar compensation. More to come in a moment. ‘Bridgewater Jerry’ fog rolls towards Hobart – video The Bureau of Meteorology shared this time lapse video of fog rolling over the River Derwent towards Hobart early this morning. The local weather phenomenon – named “Bridgewater Jerry” – is a unique, giant, snake-like fog which affects the Derwent estuary during autumn and winter: A court application has been filed by the Fair Work Commission to appoint an independent administrator to the CFMEU’s embattled general and construction divisions, AAP reports. The commission in July revealed it would take action after accusations of criminal misconduct and bikie links were levelled at the union’s construction arm. The commission’s general manager, Murray Furlong, today filed a federal court application to nominate an independent administrator to the CFMEU’s general and construction divisions. The commission has proposed the court appoint Mark Irving to the position. Irving has been a member of the Victorian Bar for nearly three decades and has experience acting on union and employer matters. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the government would begin moves to address the CFMEU, and workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, previously said the government is preparing legislation to steamroll the union at any sign of resistance. Labor’s national executive has already severed ties with the CFMEU and will no longer accept political donations or affiliation fees from the troubled construction arm. Opposition responds to Binskin report The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, has responded to Mark Binskin’s report handed to the government, regarding the Israeli strikes on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy in April that killed Australian Zomi Frankcom. Birmingham said in a statement: This report has largely confirmed Israel’s accountability, transparency and cooperation, which will only add to questions about whether domestic politics led to the Albanese government pursuing this unprecedented review of a foreign government’s military operations. Birmingham said he agreed with Binskin on the importance of “continued transparency by Israel when [the military advocate general] determines future actions.” Brave and loving humanitarian workers step into dangerous situations every day to bring relief to human suffering and we urge Israel to ensure the changes they have instigated do better protect such workers and that they take all possible steps to do so. Here’s the full story from Daniel Hurst about Mark Binskin’s report into the 1 April incident, where a World Central Kitchen aid convoy was hit by Israeli drone strikes. Have a read below for all the details: Investor lending continues to outpace owner-occupiers Lending by property investors continues to run faster than the value of home loans taken out by owner-occupiers, AAP reports, reflecting a still-tight rental market. That’s as the total value of lending to property investors, owner-occupiers and first home buyers rose 1.3% in June following a 1.7% slide in May. New housing loans hit $29.2bn, data compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed, to be 19.1% higher compared with a year earlier. ABS head of finance statistics, Mish Tan, said investor lending growth continued to outpace loans to owner-occupiers. In June, owner-occupier loans rose 0.5% to $18.2bn, while investor loans gained another 2.7%, to $11bn. Tan said: The total value of new investor loans was 30.2% higher compared to a year ago, while for owner-occupiers it was 13.2%. Oxford Economics Australia senior economist Maree Kilroy said the tight rental market and higher gross rental yields were helping to stoke investor demand. The spread between owner-occupier and investor mortgage rates has also progressively tightened with banks competing for market share. Whole of PwC ‘not corrupt’, independent reviewer Ziggy Switkowski tells inquiry The parliamentary inquiry looking into PwC is using the start of its afternoon session to question Ziggy Switkowski. Switkowski, a former senior executive at Telstra, Optus and other companies, conducted an independent review of PwC’s governance and culture. He said PwC did get a draft copy a few days before its release a year ago but only to check for errors. Former PwC chief executive Tom Seymour did not meet as part of the review but he did have “interaction” through his lawyers, Switkowski said. Switkowski said PwC governance oversight was “not match fit” and “some sort of volcanic development” occurred as a result. “The whole organisation is not corrupt,” he said, adding that diligent and talented staff had been through a “thoroughly traumatic” event following the tax leak scandal. Asked by Liberal MP Alex Hawke whether people really appreciated that “if they steal the Australian government’s tax information, that’s not serious?”. “Many don’t,” Switkowski said. Among the lessons for the event, was the need to get board and executive structures “right” and to set the “right goals” that were not merely sales and market share, he said. PwC’s bureaucracy was also “overwhelming”, even compared with rivals. It not only confuses but disguises problems. Wong says Australia’s requests of Israel reflect their existing commitments as part of international community Taking a final question, Penny Wong was asked how confident she is the Israeli government would meet the requests of the Australian government. She responded: Israel, like Australia, is a democracy, and Israel, like Australia, accepts the obligations that go with that, which include observing international law – including international humanitarian law – and international humanitarian law does call for the protection of civilians, and in particular the protection of aid workers. So we are simply reflecting the existing commitments that Israel has already made, as part of the international community. I would note also that the IDF itself has made very clear in its public statements that it accepted responsibility for the tragic deaths of Zomi Frankcom and her colleagues. Q: Is the government looking at fast tracking the visas of Australians with relatives in Gaza? Penny Wong: We are conscious about the concerns in the community about these issues and conscious of what is occurring in Gaza and the consequences for people here, including those who have come to Australia. These [are] matters that minister [Tony] Burke … will work through in the appropriate time. Asked about potential criminal charges, Mark Binskin said that would be up to the military advocate general: She is independent of the IDF, but not independent from the Israeli legal system. It would take a number of months from the time that the investigation is handed to her to make her decision and then it is a decision on her, on what she may proceed with. And asked if this would be a case with Israel or the International Court, he responded: That is up to the [military advocate general] and the ICC. It is not up to me to make that call and I must be careful about prejudicing an investigation. Mark Binskin said the Israeli government was “very forthcoming” with information during his investigation: It took time to get into Israel – which you would appreciate with the strikes that were going on and there was Passover, which we respected. It gave us a chance to talk to Solace Global and World Central Kitchen and get that side of it, and when we went in we had a fair bit of information that made the discussions very open and they were quite open … Q: Is Australia satisfied with Israel’s response to this matter? Penny Wong responded: Our position remains [that] we want full transparency and accountability. That process for accountability is not over. This report is not the end of the matter and we will continue to press for full accountability, including any appropriate criminal charges. Wong hopes Israel can understand ‘importance’ of apology Asked about the request for the Israeli government to apologise to Zomi Frankcom’s family, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, said: I have had discussions with the family as has my colleague, and we will continue to advocate on their behalf to the Israeli government … and I hope they understand the importance of that, and I hope that this request can receive a positive response. IDF response ‘timely, appropriate and with some exceptions, sufficient’: Binskin Mark Binskin said the IDF “quickly accepted responsibility for the strikes”, removed two officers from their positions and reprimanded three senior officers. He said acceptance and accountability – including holding people to account – has been “timely, appropriate and with some exceptions, sufficient.” One exception is with regard to the initial sharing of information regarding how the strikes occurred. It appears that most of the known information was presented to officials … however it is noticeable that the IDF public statement released on April 5 left specific detail included in the closed debriefing that could have helped reduce confusion and speculation. Information was only made public in the following days during media interviews and the like. Mark Binskin details findings of report into strikes on aid convoy Former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin is now speaking to the media to provide more information about the report he has provided to the government, regarding Israeli strikes on the World Central Kitchen aid convoy – which killed Australian Zomi Frankcom. What transpired on the evening of April 1 is complex and analysing information provided by all three parties, what appears to have occurred due to a significant breakdown in situational awareness within the IDF from the unexpected presence of armed locals … This was further compounded by the lack of real-time communications between the IDF and the World Central Kitchen aid workers in those escort vehicles that could have clarified the situation and likely averted the strikes. Ultimately, however, from the information provided it appears that errors in IDF decision-making and misidentification, level of confirmation bias and a failure to comply with the intent of senior command direction led to the death of one worker from the strike on the first vehicle, and that a violation of IDF standard operating procedures and rules of engagement led to the deaths of the remaining six World Central Kitchen aid workers … ‘Delays are costing lives’: Wong Speaking to reporters, Penny Wong said she has written to the Israeli foreign minister about humanitarian protection: We want more aid to flow, and we will do all we are able to achieve this. Of course the best way to protect aid workers, civilians, health workers and others is to achieve the release of hostages and increased humanitarian access to a ceasefire. The prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand have clearly said together in a statement last week that the human suffering in Gaza and is unacceptable and the war must end … Delays are costing lives. Gaza ‘the deadliest place on Earth to be an aid worker’: Wong Penny Wong said an apology “should be provided”, and said Gaza remains “the deadliest place on Earth to be an aid worker”. This was not a one-off incident. The UN reports that more than 250 aid workers have been killed since the start of this conflict, and in recent weeks, a number of UN vehicles have come under attack. This is not acceptable. She said the government is implementing all of Binskin’s recommendations, “including working with the UN and the international community to press Israel to reform its coordination … with humanitarian organisations working on the ground”. Government ‘to press for full accountability’ after ‘tragic accident’: Wong Penny Wong said that after the “tragic incident”, the Australian government made clear there would be “full accountability”. Practical action is needed to ensure that this tragedy is not repeated … As the report makes clear, Israel’s process for determining accountability is not over. The military advocate general of Israel is still to decide on further action. That is a decision for her and for the Israeli judicial system. However, Australia’s expectation remains that this decision be transparent. And Ms Frankcom’s family, who I have spoken to, are firmly of the view that further action is necessary, including criminal investigation, and they feel that the disciplinary action taken today is insufficient. The Australian government will continue to press for full accountability, including any appropriate criminal charges, and we will continue to advocate the views of the Frankcom family and the Australian government Israel. Wong addresses media about report on Israeli drone strikes on aid convoy The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is speaking to the media after the release of an “unclassified edition” of the report on the 1 April incident, when a World Central Kitchen aid convoy was hit by Israeli drone strikes. Daniel Hurst brought us more details about this earlier in the blog. Speaking to reporters, Wong has said: I would like to start by saying we honour the life of Zomi Frankcom. Her selflessness, her courage and her service to others even in the most challenging of circumstances is to be respected and is to be honoured … It is clear those deaths were a consequence of a failure of IDF controls, errors in decision-making and misidentification, a failure to comply with senior command direction and a violation of IDF procedures and rules of engagement. As the IDF itself has said, this incident should not have occurred and was a grave mistake. Israel is bound by international humanitarian law. This includes the protection of civilians and the provision of aid … Demonstrably, that did not occur in relation to Zomi Frankcom and her World Central Kitchen colleagues. ‘Dangerous inside boys’ club’ marked PwC’s response to tax scandal, inquiry told The day-long parliamentary inquiry into PwC’s tax scandal and its aftermath has been examining how the consulting firm’s response after its leaders learnt of the gathering storm. Meredith Beattie, a former PwC general counsel, has been describing how it dealt with a myriad of issues that posed an “enormous risk” to the firm in Australia. Beattie, who will be called back at a later date to provide in camera evidence, told the inquiry that she was not given an opportunity by PwC to advise partners about a vote in 2020 on who should lead the firm. Senator Deborah O’Neill said it was “unfathomable” that partners didn’t get to hear from their independent legal counsel on the matter. Beattie said there were initially four nominees to lead PwC, but that tally was narrowed down to Tom Seymour and Sean Gregory. While normally abstaining from such votes, she decided to vote against Seymour. Seymour won the two-horse race but resigned in 2023 when it became public he was one of dozens of partners who received emails about the confidential tax leak by former adviser Peter-John Collins. O’Neill said PwC’s handling of the leadership in the wake of the scandal “sounds like some dangerous inside boys club where they cover each other over”. The hearing has begun and Linda Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, is starting with his opening arguments. Bennett says “every fairytale needs a villain” and Reynolds was just that following the Brittany Higgins’ decision to publicly allege she had been raped in Reynolds’ office by a colleague, Bruce Lehrmann, in 2021. Bennett says Higgins created a “fictional story of political cover up” detailing ill treatment, ostracisation, and bullying but “none of it was true”. The veracity of Higgins’ rape allegations has never been questioned by Reynolds, Bennett says. Terrible circumstance but not what this case is about. He continues. Mark Binskin report says Israel’s response to aid worker strike has been ‘with some exceptions, sufficient’ Let’s bring you some more details from that report by the former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin, who was asked to provide special advice to the Australian government on Israel’s response to the killing of aid workers including Zomi Frankcom. Binskin’s report, published by the Australian government today, notes that he had “no investigative powers” and all of his engagements, meetings and conversations were voluntary for those involved. But he also said he found that “all parties engaged constructively with my questions and provided the information I required”. He said he visited Israel from 5 to 13 May and “had access to all areas within the IDF that we had requested”. He said “all requests were supported, including viewing the 90-minute un-edited Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) footage (without audio) of the WCK convoy and subsequent strikes”. Binskin said he was of the view “that Israel’s acceptance of accountability for the 1 April WCK incident, and investigation, reporting and responding has, to this point, been timely, appropriate and, with some exceptions, sufficient”. He said an IDF-ordered fact-finding investigation “took less than 72 hours” and led the IDF’s chief of general staff to quickly dismiss two officers from their positions and reprimand three others. Binskin said it “would be difficult for Western militaries, including the Australian Defence Force, to be any quicker”. Binskin said “any further actions against individuals” would depend on a decision by the military advocate general (MAG) “as to whether or not to proceed further”. Binskin wrote: In my meeting with the MAG, I discussed the importance of providing a level of public transparency in her future decisions, not only ‘what’ she may decide in regard to each individual, but also an appropriate discussion as to ‘why’. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is due to hold a press conference about the report in Adelaide very soon. Linda Reynolds’ case has begun in the WA supreme court. Here’s a statement she sent us last night on the eve of the trial. It is regrettable that this trial has to proceed but I am determined to see it through. I will not be providing any comment during the trial. To do so would be inappropriate and discourteous. I have every confidence that justice will be done. The former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin says the Israeli government should provide an “appropriate apology” to the families of the Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom and her six colleagues over their killings in Gaza. The Australian government has released an “unclassified edition” of the report Binskin provided to the Australian government on the 1 April incident, when a World Central Kitchen aid convoy was hit by Israeli drone strikes. The report finds there was “a significant break down in situational awareness”. The report says it appears Israel Defense Forces (IDF) controls failed, “leading to errors in decision making and a misidentification, likely compounded by a level of confirmation bias”. However Binskin also finds: Based on the information available to me, it is my assessment that the IDF strike on the WCK aid workers was not knowingly or deliberately directed against the WCK. Wong said in a statement that Gaza “remains the deadliest place on earth to be an aid worker” and that the Australian government was “pressing Israel to reform its coordination with humanitarian organisations to protect civilians and aid workers”. Israel’s process to determine accountability for the World Central Kitchen strikes is not over. The Military Advocate General of Israel is still to decide on further action. Our expectation remains that there be transparency about the Military Advocate General’s process and decision. I have written to my Israeli counterpart to this end. We will continue to press for full accountability, including any appropriate criminal charges. Lawyers, journalists and spectators are filtering into the Western Australian supreme court this morning in the centre of Perth. Today marks the beginning of Liberal senator Linda Reynolds’ defamation trial against her former staffer, Brittany Higgins, for social posts she says damaged her reputation. Despite the high interest in the case, the courtroom’s gallery is almost empty with a handful of people spread out across the first few rows. There are more lawyers at this stage than spectators. Reynolds sits in the front row flanked by family and her team. Higgins is not expected to appear in person for the first few weeks of the trial. Who is expected to appear in Linda Reynolds’ defamation trial? Both Linda Reynolds and Brittany Higgins are expected to appear to give evidence – and we can expect a host of high-profile witnesses to offer their accounts too. In June, Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, said he had filed 17 witness files and was preparing another five. The former prime minister Scott Morrison was among them and Bennett said he could be called to the hearings. “He’s prepared to give evidence,” he said, adding that Morrison could give evidence remotely from overseas. It is expected other Liberal senators could attend to provide their version of events, including senators Michaelia Cash and Wendy Askew and former foreign affairs minister Marise Payne. Beyond politicians, expert medical witnesses may appear. The News Corp political journalist Samantha Maiden, who broke the original story along with Lisa Wilkinson for The Project, may also be called up. David Sharaz is not expected to appear. Why is Linda Reynolds taking Brittany Higgins and David Sharaz to court? Brittany Higgins’ decision to publicly allege she had been raped in Linda Reynolds’ office by a colleague, Bruce Lehrmann, in 2021 has led to a long-running saga of legal battles. Lehrmann has always vehemently denied the allegation and pleaded not guilty at the criminal trial, which was aborted due to juror misconduct. A second trial did not proceed due to prosecutors’ fears for Higgins’ mental health. As part of his failed defamation trial against Network 10 and Lisa Wilkinson, a federal court in April found that, on the balance of probabilities, he raped Higgins. Higgins settled a personal injury claim against the government for an undisclosed amount in December 2022. The amount has been reported as high as $3m, but Higgins has said it was substantially lower. In June the following year, Reynolds said she would refer the payout to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Reynolds claimed the payment to Higgins was finalised in an “unusually swift” manner, “raising serious questions about how this significant sum of public money was determined and allocated”. In July, Higgins responded in an Instagram story, urging Reynolds to “stop”. Reynolds responded by sending a concerns notice against her former staffer, saying “ever since Ms Higgins first made her allegations of rape public, I have been the target of unwarranted criticism and abuse”. After Higgins published another statement on Twitter/X two weeks later, Reynolds proceeded to take legal action and filed a writ in August. Court documents show Reynolds alleges that Higgins’ posts were in breach of a settlement and release signed in March 2021. That settlement allegedly contained a non-disparagement clause. Reynolds is also suing David Sharaz for two tweets, published to his Twitter/X account in January and December 2022. Sharaz said in April that he would no longer fight the case as he could not afford legal costs. Linda Reynolds’ defamation case against Brittany Higgins is about to get under way in the Western Australia supreme court. The WA senator is suing Higgins, who is her former staffer, and Higgins’ husband, David Sharaz, over social media posts she alleges damaged her reputation. Our reporter Sarah Basford Canales is in court and will be sending updates as the trial unfolds. But we won’t have an outcome for a while – the trial is expected to continue until early September, and a judgment could take weeks or months more. Read more here about the case and how it ended up in court: Superannuation giant Mercer has been ordered to pay $11.3m after it admitted misleading the public about the sustainability of its investments, AAP reports. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission last year launched federal court proceedings against the company, accusing it of engaging in greenwashing between November 2021 and March 2023. It alleged Mercer falsely claimed its “Sustainable Plus” investment options excluded investments in companies involved in the production or sale of alcohol, gambling and fossil fuels. In reality, six of the seven investment options were connected to those industries. Mercer admitted the breaches in December 2023, conceding it made false or misleading statements to the public. The corporate watchdog and Mercer agreed to a $11.3m fine, which the federal court formally confirmed this morning. Justice Christopher Horan also ordered Mercer to publish a notice on the sustainable investments page of its website detailing its admitted conduct. The notice must remain on the website for six months, he said. Looking for a lunchtime read? Get stuck into the latest Weekly Beast from Amanda Meade below: A police senior sergeant who drove her car into gunfire during the siege at Wieambilla has told an inquest of the moment she heard rifle shots and thought to herself: “We’re in serious trouble here.” Christina Esselink was the most senior officer on site when she arrived at the “frantic” command post in the hours after the shootings of police constables Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold and civilian neighbour Alan Dare. At this point in time police were mounting a rescue operation for Const Keely Brough, who remained on the remote property in western Queensland with conspiracy theorists Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train. Soon after Sen Sgt Esselink arrived, a call went out over police radio for a vehicle to urgently block the exit from the property. Esselink said she decided to drive her car down to the property entrance, rather than take command of the police response as she might have done under police procedures. I looked at my vehicle, which drove terribly, big and ugly and strong. [I thought] we’ve got to get it down there … we’ve got to block off the gate. Esselink said she knew tactical response officers were on the way, and that she needed to contain the shooters on the property. She parked the car between two others to block the gate and came under gunfire as she reached for her police tablet. It was all bang bang bang and I thought, oh geez that [the calibre of the rifle being used] is big. I grew up on a farm, this was like big and it’s close and I thought, ‘Oh we’re in trouble. We’re in serious trouble here.’ I thought it was a large calibre and it was close. As Esselink got out of the car looking for cover, another officer screamed at her to “run”. Some legionnaires’ patients admitted to ICU Dr Clare Looker said a “number of cases” have required admission into intensive care. We don’t have exact numbers and that’s partly why I’m cautious about presenting exact numbers. That’s partly because people can move in and out of ICU over the course of their admission and there can be other factors that contribute to whether they require intensive care management. Most cases exposed between 5-20 July, Victoria’s chief health officer says Back at the press conference, Dr Clare Looker says there are 100 cooling towers in the suburb, of which 41 have been inspected, tested and disinfected. Disinfection happens at the time that these visits are made, usually within 24 hours of the testing – even if their test results are not yet back and available. That means that irrespective of whether legionella bacteria is present, disinfection is put through the system and then any legionella that is there is dealt with immediately. Dr Looker said it would be a “number of days” before authorities had test results from the samples at the cooling towers. We are undertaking detailed analysis including understanding weather patterns that may have explained the wide geographical distribution of cases. We’ve been working very closely with and are grateful for the support of the Bureau of Meteorology, and air scientists to understand how weather patterns in mid July in Melbourne may have contributed to the spread of cases. She said authorities believed most cases were exposed between 5-20 July. Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia, or lung infection, caused by legionella bacteria. You can read a full explainer on what this disease is, and how it is contracted, below: Fifty-nine people hospitalised with legionnaires as 10 more cases suspected As we reported yesterday, Dr Clare Looker says that as of 3pm yesterday there were 60 cases and 10 suspected infections of legionnaires. She said 59 cases, and seven of the suspected cases, had been hospitalised. She said authorities had narrowed down the location of the contaminated water source – most likely a cooling tower – to Laverton North or Derrimut. Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Clare Looker, is providing an update on the state’s legionnaires’ outbreak. She has confirmed the first death – a woman in her 90s, who became ill on Tuesday evening and presented to hospital and died shortly after. Our condolences are with her family. Foodbank Victoria has announced it is “dangerously low” on food and will be holding a large-scale emergency food drive for next weekend. In a statement, the organisation said the cost of living was “not only hitting families hard” but its network of growers, farmers and food partners across the state was “all feeling the impact as well”. They have the same rising cost of ingredients to deal with, and they don’t carry large inventories. So there’s much less to donate to Foodbank at a time when demand is the highest we’ve ever seen and rising. We’re spending more money on food, around $5m in the last year. But with 65,000 people to feed every day, no matter how hard we work, we can’t keep enough food on our shelves. The organisation is asking anyone in a position to help to drop off food directly to Foodbank at 4/2 Somerville Road, Yarraville on 10 and 11 August 10 between 10am and 3pm. They are looking specifically for tuna, pasta, pasta sauce, rice, cereal, UHT milk, canned fruit and canned vegetables. Garma festival begins – in photos Our very own Mike Bowers is at the annual Garma festival and has taken these photos as the day kicks off: Yalmay Yunupingu borrows from Whitney Houston with a message for the future Senior Australian of the Year Yalmay Yunupingu has drawn on her background as a leader in Northern Territory education and among the Yolgnu Indigenous people of north-east Arnhem Land to urge Australians to begin a new cycle of growth, in an opening address to this year’s Garma festival. Yunupingu drew on this year’s festival theme, “Fire, strength, renewal”, and on Indigenous people’s relationship with the environment to encourage “rehabilitation, regeneration, rejuvenation” and herald what she said must be “the fresh new beginning of the life cycle”. We should all stand up and educate ourselves, our children, our young people to be strong citizens of this country, Australia, and stay strong and focused. She drew laughter and applause as she re-wrote the words to the late American singer Whitney Houston’s famous power ballad The Greatest Love of All. I have taken a song by Whitney Houston and changed a few words as follows: I believe the children are our future leaders, yesterday, today, tomorrow and tomorrow. Let them lead the way. Show the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride, dignity and identity – not to be balanda [non-Indigenous people] but Yolgnu, living in two worlds. The annual Garma festival has opened at Gulkula in north-east Arnhem Land with a call for Indigenous Australians to move past the rejection of last year’s voice referendum and come together to advance the interests of First Nations Australians. At an opening event to honour Senior Australian of the Year Yalmay Yunupingu, Rirratingu traditional owner Mayatili Marika, of the University of Melbourne’s Indigenous Knowledge Institute, urged those gathered not to allow the referendum result to divide their communities. “The 14th of October is behind us and we choose to move forward,” Mayatili told the crowd at the opening forum session of the first festival since the referendum proposal for an Indigenous voice to parliament was rejected. As Yolgnu people, we have a deep and everlasting connection with the land. It means we cannot turn away from this country no matter what. Nor can we turn away from each other and fall back on old arguments and disputes. When two people come together, as has happened in Australia since colonisation, you can find differences. But the challenge is to find out how we are the same – what unites us, not what divides us... Something happened on the 14th of October but it is nothing we have not faced before. Just circling back to our earlier posts on the 896kg worth of methamphetamine allegedly imported to Australia from the United States hidden inside industrial machinery. Here are some photos that have come through from the Australian federal police: PM echoes concern for Australians in Lebanon Turning to the conflict in the Middle East, Anthony Albanese said the message from the Australian government is “we want a de-escalation”. We want to see the Biden peace proposal implemented, as advanced by the United States. We want to see a ceasefire, we want to see hostages released, we want to see a de-escalation, we want to see moves towards a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security and stability and prosper into the future. We will continue to advocate strongly on all of these issues but we are very concerned – I repeat again the statement that I made yesterday – we are particularly concerned about Australians continuing to visit Lebanon or staying in Lebanon. We are concerned that if there is an escalation at Beirut airport, if it is closed to commercial aircraft, there may well be difficulty getting people home. Anthony Albanese is speaking to the media from Brisbane. The prime minister is seemingly being asked (again) about the prospects of an early election, and responded: I’m not sure of another nation around the world that has an election every three years or shorter. That is my view. I am just focused on getting the job done… Here’s a list of the Australians to keep an eye out for during today’s Olympics schedule: More arrests ‘likely’ after alleged seizure of nearly 900kg of meth – police Taking questions from reporters, AFP detective superintendent Peter Fogarty said there were two men at the premises on Warwick Farm – where the drugs were allegedly delivered to – when AFP officers arrived on Wednesday. One man has been arrested and charged. The second man was arrested and has been released and his involvement will be subject to further inquiries. Fogarty said there was “likely to be further arrests in the future” as inquiries continue. There hadn’t been any arrests made in the US, he said, with police believing the drugs had likely come from the US or “potentially from Mexico”. Police will allege the man who has been charged had knowledge there was an illicit substance inside the consignment. Fogarty: We think his role was to receive it. You know, almost 900 kilos is really a massive amount of drugs, so I think there is … very much an organised crime syndicate behind this, a much bigger syndicate who has access to large sums of money in order to bring these sorts of quantities of drugs to Australia. The Australian Federal Police are speaking to the media from Sydney, announcing the seizure of 896kg worth of methamphetamine – with an estimated street value of $828m – allegedly imported to Australia from the United States hidden inside industrial machinery. A 31-year-old man from south-west Sydney has been charged for his alleged role in the importation, and appeared in Downing Centre local court on Thursday charged with one count of possessing a commercial quantity of the drug. He has been remanded in custody and will next face court on 2 October. Police told the media that the drugs were found concealed within two large industrial machines exported from the US, estimated to have led to almost 9 million individual street deals. AFP Det Supt Peter Fogarty told the media: We allege the Winston Hills man opened the container on its arrival at the property of Warwick Farm and with assistance of a forklift began to access the contents inside. The man was subsequently arrested … Our investigations are ongoing and we’re working towards further arrests. PwC chief says withheld report ‘not pertinent’ but denies reading it The inquiry has zeroed in a “statement of facts” report compiled by PwC into the tax scandal with the help of two legal firms. Senator Deborah O’Neill said it was “completely intolerable” that PwC had not handed over that report to the inquiry. PwC CEO Kevin Burrowes said it “wasn’t mine to provide the report” and that he had “made several requests” for it. “I don’t believe it is pertinent” to the inquiry, Burrowes said, standing by previous comments to the probe that he had not read the report. O’Neill said the report was “extremely” relevant, noting that the new CEO had “straddled two spheres”, the international and Australian ones. Earlier, Burrowes said he had agreed to take up the “really tough job” because he had been “a proud PwC partner for many, many years” and he believed in the firm. PwC Australia was “in great difficulty at the time” and he wanted to help. Consultancy giant PwC is getting a grilling today from a parliamentary committee raking over a scandal involving a former partner, Peter-John Collins, who revealed the previous government’s tax plans in 2015 for multinational companies to corporate clients. Most of the early focus has been on the failure of PwC Australia’s new chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, to inform inquiry members – and PwC’s own chief risk and ethics leader – that his (corrected) annual salary of $2.8m was actually topped up from PwC to the tune of $1.2m a year. Jan McCahey, the chief risk official, only learned of the additional payment of $1.2m on 20 June this year, about 11 months after Burrowes took up his new role. “I was surprised to learn of it at the time,” she told the inquiry, being led by Labor senator Deborah O’Neill following the breaking of the scandal in 2022. O’Neill and Liberal National senator Paul Scarr have been pressing Burrowes and McCahey on whether the firm had been transparent about the payment and whether there was potential for a conflict of interest in not making it public. O’Neill: You kept it secret for more than a year. [It] looks very deceptive to me … Your decision to accept payment from two masters is replete with a conflict of interest. I can’t understand why you don’t see that. Burrowes defended his stance on not revealing to the inquiry earlier the additional salary, saying “we have been transparent” and adding: “I feel there has been a misunderstanding.” Given today’s hearing is scheduled to last until 5.45pm, it might be a pretty long – and grilling – day. Border force allegedly finds $13m worth of meth in luggage A Canadian woman will face court after flying to Brisbane and allegedly concealing $13.4m worth of methamphetamine in her luggage, AAP reports. The 24-year-old underwent a bag examination after arriving at Brisbane international airport from Fiji on 28 July after travelling from Vancouver. Australian Border Force officers allegedly found 14.4kg of meth inside towels soaked in vinegar and layered with coffee beans. The meth had an estimated value of $13.4m, which was enough for almost 145,000 street deals, Australian federal police have said. The woman was charged with one count of importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug – an offence which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The woman will face Brisbane magistrates court today. New tech trialled to help ease Sydney’s traffic woes Cutting-edge technology to prevent trucks from getting stuck in Sydney tunnels will be trialled in a bid to reduce traffic bank-ups on major roads, AAP reports. The NSW government says the six-month trial will combine sensor technology and warning signs to divert trucks taller than 4m from entering tunnels and getting jammed. Trucks will be scanned by the sensors, and their height and number plate will be displayed to drivers on overhead digital signs further along the road. The trial is part of a crackdown on trucks jamming tunnel entrances and causing major disruptions to the city’s road network. Roads minister John Graham said the government was “resolute in its commitment to stopping over-height trucks from shutting down our city and inconveniencing motorists”. Transport for NSW executive Craig Moran said the move would save time and money for motorists and save money for the state by reducing “closure minutes” for tunnels. The first trial is under way on the southbound lanes of the M1 Pacific Motorway at the Mount White heavy vehicle safety station, the government said. Moran: We’re starting at Mount White but aim to eventually roll out this new technology to all key heavy vehicle routes entering Sydney. We’ll evaluate the results of the trial in six months’ time. Two-thirds of people only visit the dentist when they have a problem, with affordability the main reason keeping them away, according to new data from the Australian Dental Association (ADA). The data – released as part of the annual oral health survey of 25,000 people – found that 61% of people delayed treatment in the past 12 months, which is a 17% increase in the last 13 years. Affordability accounted for 63% of respondent’s reason for the delay – a 12% increase on 2022. A third of survey respondents rated their oral health as “poor” or “very poor” and over half of these people were aged over 65. ADA president Dr Scott Davis said: All the more reason that there needs to be help from the government for a greater number of Australians so they can get the regular dental treatment they so badly need and often can’t afford. This is particularly the case for seniors in residential aged care, and our most vulnerable populations including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, those on low wages and people with a disability. If people saw their dentist regularly, they’d be less likely to face more complex treatment further down the track. Government-funded schemes for our most vulnerable populations would go a long way to making this a reality for millions of Aussies for whom at the moment a dental visit isn’t a financial reality. The probe into PwC is continuing today, and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill says the focus will be on confidence in the audit sector. O’Neill, chair of the joint standing committee on corporations and financial services, spoke to ABC RN about the probe earlier and said: The Australian Treasury has indicated … that confidence in this sort of profession … really underpins the effectiveness of the financial reporting framework in Australia, and in doing so, it fosters the sort of confidence that we need in the integrity of our capital markets. And why that matters is that this market that operates the economic market, all Australians have a share. This is not something just a group of people at a board table, behind closed oak doors can determine. We all have a share in how well our capital markets work, because our superannuation decisions that are made about where the trustees invest their money on our behalf are all informed by the integrity of what these big audit companies do. Asked if the government would dial back its reliance on these companies, O’Neill responded: “Absolutely.” The government has come in and made sure that we are increasing our public service capacity and that our reliance on consultancies is in decrease … At the moment, I don’t think I have confidence that any of the major consultancy companies are as forthright or accountable to the Australian people as they need to be. Honorary consul says some Australians in Lebanon deciding to stay The honorary consul to Lebanon in Tasmania, Faddy Zouky, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning, following news that Australians have been asked to leave Lebanon. Foreign minister Penny Wong had warned there is a “real risk that the conflict in the region escalates seriously” and the security situation could deteriorate quickly and with little notice. Zouky said he was in Lebanon two weeks ago and “a lot of Australians were there”, and that loved ones here in Australia “are concerned”. Some are, of course, adhering [with directions to leave]. You’ll see some of the airports getting busier and people departing. But there are some people who remain, and the reason being, they’re just used to the conflict – they were born into it, and it’s nothing new to them. Here’s what you missed overnight from the Olympics, thanks to our sports editor Mike Hytner in Paris: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has congratulated the 4x200 relay champions Mollie O’Callaghan, Lani Pallister, Bri Throssell and Ariarne Titmus on social media earlier this morning: Richard Boyle crowdfund hits target in less than eight hours A crowdfunding campaign to help the former tax office employee Richard Boyle pay for a high court appeal has hit its $23,000 target in less than eight hours, according to his supporters. Boyle accused the Australian Taxation Office of aggressively pursuing debts from taxpayers and had fought to be protected from prosecution under the Public Interest Disclosure Act, but this argument was rejected by South Australia’s district court in March 2023. An appeal court also rejected this argument in June 2024, prompting Boyle to pursue an appeal to the high court. The charges against Boyle include allegations he taped taping private conversations without consent and took photos of taxpayer information. Rex Patrick, a former senator who founded the Whistleblower Justice Fund, said the federal government had “totally underestimated the support for Richard Boyle in the community”. Patrick said Boyle’s “last hope is for the high court to re-interpret our current whistleblower protection laws with greater regard to the objects of the legislation as set by the parliament”. Four-day Garma festival to begin today Continuing from our last post: Prime minister Anthony Albanese will join new minister for Indigenous Australians Malarndirri McCarthy and her retiring predecessor, Linda Burney, for the opening of the four-day Garma festival today. Reflection on the referendum result and pathways to change will feature heavily in the festival’s program, in the wake of the latest Productivity Commission findings on Closing the Gap targets, which showed a lack of progress in key socio-economic determinants. Megan Davis hailed the determination of members of the Uluru Youth Dialogue who gathered on Kabi Kabi land on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast last weekend to analyse the result and consider next steps. Uluru Youth Dialogue co-chair and Wiradjuri woman Bridget Cama said the 2024 youth summit had been a time of “deep reflection” on last year’s vote. The path to meaningful constitutional recognition for First Nations People has been long, and now that path has become a little longer. We wanted to gather as youth again to not only yarn and grieve the result together in person, but to learn from the last couple of years and refocus our attention on what’s next. One of the co-chairs of the Uluru Dialogues that led to last year’s referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament has declared the need for First Nations recognition and representation to be as urgent as it ever was, as the first annual Garma festival begins in north-east Arnhem Land since the bid to amend the constitution failed As hundreds gathered for the festival at Gulkula on the Gove peninsula, University of New South Wales constitutional law professor and Cobble Cobble woman Megan Davis said data from the referendum showed that most Indigenous Australians had voted “yes” for a constitutionally enshrined voice. More and more Australians are saying the referendum was a missed opportunity. Our research shows that many Australians voted ‘no’ because they thought First Nations people didn’t want this change. The polling results show that the majority did. We must move forward on fact … not opinions. The need for First Nations recognition and representation was urgent then, and it’s urgent now. Greens call on new housing minister to negotiate on shared equity scheme Sticking with the housing theme, Daniel Hurst has introduced with Liberal senator Andrew Bragg’s PBO research, the Greens have wasted no time in challenging new housing minister Clare O’Neil to return to the negotiating table. The Coalition said no to working with the government to pass its shared equity scheme, help to buy and the build-to-rent legislation, leaving the Greens and crossbench the only option to passing the housing bills. Negotiations stalled under former minister Julie Collins, with the Greens starting demands of tax reform including a phase out of negative gearing and a coordinated national phase in of a two-year rent freeze a bridge too far for the government. The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, has written to O’Neil, inviting her to speak with them over the government’s legislation – as long as she promised to come in good faith. He said: Minister, your appointment in the middle of this crisis represents a historic opportunity to take bold action. There is broad popular support for phasing out tax handouts for investors, rent caps, and mass investment in public housing. I urge you to seize this opportunity to reopen negotiations with the Greens and work towards solutions that will give some hope to the millions doing it tough. The Coalition is promoting its super-for-housing policy with new figures suggesting it could reduce federal government spending on rent assistance for today’s 35 to 45-year-old cohort by $1.8bn over 10 years. But the parliamentary budget office (PBO) – which prepared the analysis to Coalition specifications – cautioned that the policy was “unlikely to benefit a large number of individuals” on commonwealth rent assistance and “the precise number of affected persons is subject to a high level of uncertainty”. The Coalition asked the PBO to analyse its policy of allowing individuals to withdraw up to $50,000 from their superannuation (up to a maximum 40% of their superannuation balance) to purchase their first home. It specifically asked the PBO to quantify the savings to commonwealth rent assistance, focusing on people aged 35 to 45, but not the impact on the federal budget overall. The PBO was asked to “assume that 20% of renters would purchase a home due to the scheme”. The PBO responded that for this cohort of individuals aged 35 to 45, the proposal was expected to reduce the cost of commonwealth rent assistance by $689m over the four-year budget period from 2024-25. The total expected savings generated from reduced rent assistance over the decade to 2034-35 would be $1.81bn. But the PBO pointed out that individuals receiving commonwealth rent assistance “typically have low superannuation balances and therefore uptake from this cohort is expected to be limited”. It also warned: The proposed policy would have additional implications for government taxation revenue, particularly for superannuation tax, which were not included in this analysis. The Coalition’s shadow assistant minister for home ownership, Andrew Bragg, said the PBO data he commissioned “shows taxpayers are now paying a heavy price for Labor’s busted housing policies”. Bragg alleged that Labor’s housing policy was “based around a ‘rent forever’ model where super funds and foreign fund managers are encouraged to construct ‘build to rent’ houses”. New South Wales will become the first state in the country to hold a parliamentary inquiry into the effects of “harmful” pornography as part of the government’s bid to address domestic violence. The Minns government announced the inquiry today after what it said was growing community concern about the exposure of children to violence and extreme pornography. The attorney general, Michael Daley, has requested a parliamentary committee examine impacts of harmful pornography – including pornography that is violent and misogynistic – on mental, emotional and physical health. The inquiry will also report on the production and dissemination of deepfake or AI-generated pornography, the effects on minority groups, and the effectiveness of current restrictions on access to pornography and where they should be changed. The acting minister for the prevention of domestic violence, Rose Jackson, said: We must address the scourge of domestic violence and sexual assault from every angle, and importantly that includes the normalisation of misogyny and violence online. The ease at which children and young people are able to access this content is extremely concerning. Good morning, and welcome back to the Australia news live blog this Friday – I’m Emily Wind and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of today. As AAP reports, Liberal senator Linda Reynolds and her former staffer Brittany Higgins are set to return to court today. The former defence minister is suing Higgins over a series of social media posts she says damaged her reputation. Mediation has failed to resolve the case, which is listed in the Western Australian supreme court today for opening submissions. It’s set down for four-to-five weeks and the witnesses could include former prime minister Scott Morrison. The Coalition is promoting its super-for-housing policy today, but the parliamentary budget office has cautioned the policy was “unlikely to benefit a large number of individuals” on commonwealth rent assistance and “the precise number of affected persons is subject to a high level of uncertainty”. We’ll bring you the full analysis from Daniel Hurst shortly. In New South Wales, the state will become the first in the country to hold a parliamentary inquiry into the effects of “harmful” pornography as part of the government’s bid to address domestic violence. Catie McLeod will bring us more details in a moment. As always, you can get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or email, emily.wind@theguardian.com. with any thoughts, tips or questions. Let’s get started."

                    "headline": "How TikTok bots and AI have powered a resurgence in UK far-right violence",
                    "bodyText": "Less than three hours after the stabbing attack on Monday that led to the death of three children, an AI-generated image was shared on X by an account called Europe Invasion. It depicted bearded men in traditional Muslim dress outside the Houses of Parliament, one waving a knife, behind a crying child in a union jack T-shirt. The tweet, which has since been viewed 900,000 times, was captioned: “We must protect our children!” and shared by one of the most potent accounts for misinformation about the Southport stabbings. AI technology has been used in other ways, including an anti-immigration Facebook group that illustrated a call to attend a rally in Middlesbrough by generating an image of a large crowd at the town’s cenotaph. Platforms like Suno – which employs AI to generate music complete with vocals and instruments – have been used to create online songs combining references to Southport with xenophobic content. Titles include “Southport Saga” featuring an AI female voice singing lyrics such as “hunt them down somehow”. Experts have warned that new tools and ways of organising have seen Britain’s fractured far right exploit the Southport attack to unify and rejuvenate its presence on the streets. In a surge of activity not seen for years, more than 10 protests are being promoted across social media platforms such as X, TikTok and Facebook in the aftermath of violent disorder up and down the country. Death threats against the UK prime minister, incitement to attack government property and extreme antisemitism were also among the comments on the Telegram channel of one extreme-right outfit this week. Amid fears of violence spreading, a leading counter-extremism thinktank warned there was a risk that the far right could achieve a mobilisation not seen since the English Defence League (EDL) burst on to the streets in the 2010s. An added new dimension has come with the advent of easily accessible AI tools that extremists have been using to create material ranging from inflammatory images to songs and music. Andrew Rogoyski, a director at the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said advances – with image-generating tools now widely available online – mean “anyone can create anything”. He added: “The ability for anyone to be able to create powerful imagery using generative AI is of tremendous concern. The onus then switches to providers of such AI models to strengthen the built-in guardrails within the model to make it harder to create such imagery.” Joe Mulhall, the director of research at the campaign group Hope Not Hate, said the use of AI-generated material was nascent but reflected the growing overlap and collaboration online between a range of individuals and groups. While far-right organisations such as Britain First and Patriotic Alternative continue to be at the forefront of mobilising and agitating, just as important are a range of individuals not affiliated to any particular group. “These are made up of thousands of individuals who offer micro-donations of time and sometimes money to collaborate towards common political goals, completely outside traditional organisational structures,” Mulhall said. “These movements lack formal leaders but rather have figureheads, often drawn from an increasing selection of far-right social media ‘influencers’.” In terms of the promotion of the protests, the hashtag #enoughisenough has been used by some rightwing influencers according to Joe Ondrak, a senior analyst at Logically, a UK company that monitors disinformation. “What’s key is how that phrase and hashtag has been used with prior anti-migrant activism,” he said. The use of bots was also highlighted by analysts. Tech Against Terrorism, an initiative launched by a branch of the UN, cited a TikTok account that began posting content only after the Southport attack on Monday. “All posts were related to Southport, with most calling for protests near the attack site on 30 July. Despite having no previous content, the posts relating to Southport amassed over 57,000 cumulative views on TikTok alone within hours,” said a spokesperson. “This suggested that bot networks were actively promoting this material.” A central role is being played by a constellation of individuals and groups around Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist who fled abroad earlier this week before a court hearing. Others include Laurence Fox, the actor turned rightwing activist who has been sharing misinformation in recent days, and conspiracy theory websites such as the Unity News Network (UNN). On the channel that UNN operates on Telegram – a largely unmoderated messaging platform – commentators rejoiced in violence seen outside Downing Street on Wednesday. “I hope they burn it to the ground,” said one. Another called for the hanging of Keir Starmer, the prime minister, saying: “Starmer needs the Mussalini [sic] treatment.” Among those spotted on the ground during riots in Southport were activists from Patriotic Alternative – considered one of the fastest-growing far-right groups in recent times. Other groups, including those who have split over their positions on conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, or Israel, have also sought to engage. Dr Tim Squirrell, the director of communications at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue counter-extremism thinktank, said that the far right had been seeking to mobilise on the street in the past year, including on Armistice Day and at film screenings by Robinson. “This is a febrile environment and is only exacerbated by the health of the online information environment which is the worst it’s been in recent years,” he said. “Robinson remains one of the more effective organisers in the UK far right. However, we have also seen the rise of accounts, large and small, which curate news stories that appeal to anti-migrant and anti-Muslim sensibilities, and are unconcerned by spreading information that is unverified. “There is a risk that this moment could be exploited to attempt to create street mobilisation that more closely resembles the 2010s.”"

                    "bodyText": "Australian universities’ dependence on international student fees has “fuelled a culture of revenue, profit and competition” and created an unstable business model, the head of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has warned. Critics representing various interests in the sector joined in expressing anxiety at the position universities had found themselves in as the federal government aggressively tries to wind back the number of international students. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, said tertiary institutions had “come to rely on international student revenue to fund everything we do in the face of declining government support in recent years – from teaching and research to infrastructure projects and employing people in well-paid jobs”. In percentage terms, Australia has more international students than any OECD country bar Luxembourg – and well in excess of the UK, Canada and the United States. The Group of Eight (Go8) institutions are particularly reliant on international student fees, with foreign enrolments making up 47% of the total cohort at the University of Sydney and more than 35% at the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University, the University of Queensland and the University of Adelaide. Universities earn nearly twice as much from overseas students as from domestic students. Average revenue per domestic full-time equivalent student was $22,996 in 2023, compared with $41,117 for an overseas equivalent student. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The president of the NTEU, Alison Barnes, said a growing dependence on foreign income had fuelled “corporatisation” of the sector. “[International students] add a lot to our campuses, they’re an asset – but they’re seen as cash cows,” she said. “There’s a systemic risk associated with relying on international student fees that was demonstrated during Covid – it’s not stable. But it’s inherently problematic beyond the associated risks. “The aggressive pursuit of international student income has fuelled a culture of revenue, profit and competition for students.” When the federal government released its strategy to fix Australia’s “broken” migration system late last year, international students were squarely on the agenda. The education minister, Jason Clare, said the government was sending a “clear message” it would act to “protect Australia’s reputation as a high-quality international education provider”, announcing tougher minimum English-language requirements and targeted visa scrutiny of “high-risk” providers. Since then, a series of levers have been pulled aiming to reduce the flow of international students into Australia, which reached record highs in February. First, the commonwealth proposed a cap on international students, giving the education minister unprecedented powers to limit enrolments by institution and course. Then it more than doubled the international student visa application fee from $710 to $1,600, a move described by the International Education Association of Australia as “death by a thousand cuts”. Sheehy described the government’s approach to international students as “policy chaos” that could cost thousands of jobs. The sector needed “certainty, stability and growth”, he told Guardian Australia. “International education is a great Australian success story and any changes to the policies that underpin this $48bn sector must be weighed carefully against its significant and far-reaching impact,” he said. ‘A victim of its own success’ Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary at the immigration department, has been lobbying the federal government to implement a minimum university entrance exam score in place of its proposed reforms. He said the score, similar to an Atar, would limit the incentive for institutions to put tuition fee revenue above academic excellence. Rizvi has been a longstanding critic of successive governments’ approach to international education. He told the National Press Club in June that the “underfunded” sector had “long been chasing tuition revenue from overseas students and sacrificing learning integrity in the process”. But he maintains that an increase in visa fees will simply mean more government revenue – not better quality students. “We’re actually shooting ourselves in the foot,” he wrote earlier this year. “The people it will deter will tend to be good students with options.” Gwilym Croucher, a higher education expert at the University of Melbourne, said Australia had been a “victim of its own success” in many ways. “International student revenue has provided a lot of resources but caused inequality between institutions,” Croucher said, pointing to the University of Sydney, which derives more than 40% of its total revenue from foreign enrolments – more than the funding it receives from the government. “That is an extraordinary amount, it’s brought them a huge bounty, but for the government, there’s often no need to make decisions about the allocation of resources … because there’s been a lot of money flowing into the system that can smooth over the gaps.” Of the $34.7bn in revenue universities received in 2022, $8.5bn came from international students. In 2012, the figure was about $4bn. And while international student revenue has more than doubled, federal government investment has lagged for three decades. Current investment in research and development sits well below the OECD average. Croucher said the drift dated back to the global financial crisis, leading to a gradual unwinding of investment in bodies such as the Australian Research Council (ARC). “It’s a hard conversation we have to have,” Croucher said. “Research is a long-term investment, but difficult for politicians to sell.” The deputy chief executive of the Group of Eight, Matthew Brown, said international student revenue was necessary to make up for government underfunding of research and teaching in “key disciplines” such as engineering, health and science. “All Go8 members are in the top 100 universities globally and this reflects the support of international student revenue to make up for the underfunding of government,” he said. “Where this reliance on international student revenue is greatest is in university research – the backbone of the national research effort – where Go8 members carry out 70% of Australia’s university research. “The government is making a critical mistake by using international students as a scapegoat to manage a short-term spike in migration and ease housing pressure.” Students’ debt trap Barnes said there had been a “massive growth” in marketing and recruitment spending in recent years, but little had been done to ensure international students received adequate levels of support. There is barely any regulatory policy requiring universities to ensure the welfare of their international students. “I’ve taught many international students, they’re a great joy to teach but … these are kids in a country without family support [or] friends, English isn’t their first language and they’re paying a lot of money for their degrees to not be adequately supported in what they need to achieve,” Barnes said. “I’ve seen students who may have plagiarised, not because of malice but [out of] desperation and lack of support.” Between 2016 and 2019, the Monash Graduate Association assisted with 500 academic integrity cases. Between 2020 and 2024, the number tripled to 1,500. Its president, Sahampath Hettiarachchi, said there was a direct correlation between a student’s financial circumstances and the likelihood that they would engage in academic cheating. He said he had helped international students who told him they were driven to cheat as they could not afford to repeat units because their family had already over-borrowed for them to study in Australia, or because they could not afford to pay rent. “It’s a last-ditch effort – they don’t have other options,” he said. “These students are working largely in isolation, new to the country, with little to no social support. “There’s a troubling myth international students are wealthy but in reality they’re under heavy rental stress, they’ve had to take out a loan or sell a house just to pursue their studies, not to mention staggering visa costs and airfares.”"

                    "headline": "JD Vance is the baby of big tech and big oil. He’s no ‘working-class populist’",
                    "bodyText": "Initially hailed as an inspired choice to inherit the Maga movement, James David Vance has fast proved a liability to the Trump campaign: Democrats are successfully branding him as a creepy manosphere specimen; his stances on abortion, IVF and women without children have rightly made him a focal point for criticizing the right’s obsession with controlling women’s bodies. Then there’s the issue of whether he’s really the man to mansplain Appalachia to the rest of us, given that he grew up in a city in Ohio. But one story about the junior senator continues to be accepted at face value: Vance as champion of a new “right-populism” that puts the working class first. There are no policy proposals that would vindicate that image; what’s more, Vance’s career has been financed by a nefarious combination of rightwing tech bros and the fossil fuel industry: those who have no problem polluting the public sphere with misinformation and disinformation and those profiting from polluting the atmosphere. Both are prime promoters of the libertarianism that “right-populists” supposedly disavow. Vance claims to want to break with corporate donors who care only about cheap labor resulting from a continuous influx of migrants. No doubt the Republican party’s promise to reduce immigration is real, as is the cruel plan for mass deportations – whether it will result in higher wages is anyone’s guess. One thing is sure, though: the other supposedly populist policy – raising tariffs on cheap imports – will make the already worst-off even worse off. Meanwhile, there’s no talk of raising taxes on the wealthy, in particular closing the loopholes that infamously allow hedge fund and private equity managers to have lower tax rates than their secretaries. Instead, Trump promises to reduce the corporate tax rate even further. Vance touts Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán as his model; the latter stands for an unembarrassed use of state power to enforce public morality (no same-sex marriages in Hungary!) and industrial policies in the national interest. But Orbán has also introduced a flat-rate personal income tax and the world’s highest value-added tax – which of course disproportionately falls on poorer Hungarians. If this is indeed the model, America’s billionaires will have no problem with Vance’s supposed “working-class conservatism”. Vance talks the talk of extracting the American right from libertarianism; yet, if one follows the money, a different picture is revealed. His career has been financed by reactionary venture capitalists such as Peter Thiel as well as the fossil fuel industry, who share a desire for deregulation wrapped in propaganda about “American freedom”. Vance himself has worked as a venture capitalist and is now part of a Republican ticket committed to abolishing regulations of social media, cryptocurrency, and AI. The party’s platform calls for a repeal of Biden’s executive order on responsible and, not least, worker-friendly development of AI. The irony is that the great champions of freedom and unleashing tech power are at the same time advocates of monopoly power: they really don’t like Biden’s robust anti-trust approach. They also often crucially depend on state contracts. No doubt Palantir, Thiel’s “big data analytics” firm whose central promise is effective surveillance, will want to be helpful with mass deportations. It might not just be a crude desire for taxpayer dollars which animates Silicon Valley’s new Trumpists, though; it can also be a philosophical vision. That doesn’t make things any better. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, newly converted to Trumpism, authored the Techno-Optimist Manifesto, which proclaims a belief in “accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development”. What many portentous pronouncements on human evolution boil down to is a simple demand: no restraints on developing AI, as well as an all-out commitment to nuclear power and a weird celebration of population growth as, according to Andreessen, “our planet is dramatically underpopulated”. Without naming its source, Andreessen quotes the manifesto of the Futurists – the artists who at the beginning of the 20th century worshiped technology as well as a kind of cleansing of the word through war – and who eventually became major promoters of Mussolini’s Fascism. Declaring himself a conqueror, not a victim, Andreesen rails against “a mass demoralization campaign … against technology and against life”, which supposedly has been going on for “six decades” “under varying names like … ‘sustainability’ … and … ‘social responsibility’”. The representatives of nothing less than life itself want to step on the pedal – and ask us to simply to trust a self-appointed elite of accelerationist visionaries. Vance might be the first champion of accelerationism in the White House – but he’s also an old-fashioned fossil fuel lobbyist who has weaponized climate in rightwing culture war. He’s associated renewables and electric vehicles with China – his (unsuccessful) Drive America Act suggested that buying gas and diesel cars is the only way of being a good patriot. Passively receiving wind and sunshine is also obviously not for real men; drilling makes for what scholars have called “petromasculinity”. Vance is all at once a nationalistic natalist (“breed, baby, breed!” for the nation), a promoter of fossil fuel industries (“drill, baby, drill!”), and a conduit of accelerationism (“break things, baby, break things!”). Given how unpopular he’s proven in polls, it does not seem like this is a vision for which Americans care. It’s also not the break with libertarianism that pundits praising the Republicans’ supposed turn to workers think it is. But there’s a hell of a lot of money backing it.

                    "bodyText": "Argentina’s security forces have announced plans to use artificial intelligence to “predict future crimes” in a move experts have warned could threaten citizens’ rights. The country’s far-right president Javier Milei this week created the Artificial Intelligence Applied to Security Unit, which the legislation says will use “machine-learning algorithms to analyse historical crime data to predict future crimes”. It is also expected to deploy facial recognition software to identify “wanted persons”, patrol social media, and analyse real-time security camera footage to detect suspicious activities. While the ministry of security has said the new unit will help to “detect potential threats, identify movements of criminal groups or anticipate disturbances”, the Minority Report-esque resolution has sent alarm bells ringing among human rights organisations. Experts fear that certain groups of society could be overly scrutinised by the technology, and have also raised concerns over who – and how many security forces – will be able to access the information. Amnesty International warned that the move could infringe on human rights. “Large-scale surveillance affects freedom of expression because it encourages people to self-censor or refrain from sharing their ideas or criticisms if they suspect that everything they comment on, post, or publish is being monitored by security forces,” said Mariela Belski, the executive director of Amnesty International Argentina. Meanwhile, the Argentine Center for Studies on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information said such technologies have historically been used to “profile academics, journalists, politicians and activists”, which, without supervision, threatens privacy. Milei, a far-right libertarian, rose to power late last year and has promised a hardline response to tackling crime. His security minister Patricia Bullrich reportedly seeks to replicate El Salvador’s controversial prison model, while the administration is moving towards militarising security policy, according to the Center for Legal and Social Studies. The government has also cracked down on protests, with riot police recently shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators at close range, and officials threatening to sanction parents who bring children to marches. The latest measure has prompted an especially strong reaction in a country with a dark history of state repression; an estimated 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared during its brutal 1976-83 dictatorship, some thrown alive from planes on so-called “death flights”. Thousands were also tortured, and hundreds of children kidnapped. A ministry of security source said that the new unit will work under the current legislative framework, including the Personal Information Protection Act mandate. It added that it will concentrate in applying AI, data analytics and machine learning to identify criminal patterns and trends in the ministry of security databases."

                    "bodyText": "There’s a community in Ontario called Dutton which, right now, seems appropriate given the number of times Peter Dutton has name-checked the Canadian province over the last 12 months. In dozens of media interviews and speeches, Dutton (the opposition leader, not the township) has said Ontarians are getting cheap electricity because of their 20 nuclear reactors. The Coalition has announced it wants to lift Australia’s ban on nuclear electricity and put at least one reactor at seven sites around the country. Last week, Dutton again deployed his favourite Canadian talking point, telling reporters: “We could be like Ontario, where they’ve got 60 or 70% nuclear in the mix, and they’re paying about a quarter of the price for electricity that we are here in Australia.” Really cheaper? So ubiquitous has Dutton’s talking point been that it has made its way to Prof Mark Winfield, a sustainable energy expert at Ontario’s York University. And he is puzzled. “I have heard about this,” he told Temperature Check. “I must admit I find the notion of holding Ontario up as a model for electricity and climate policy more than a little bizarre.” Winfield says Ontario’s electricity rates are not low by Canadian standards, but added “the situation is distorted by the [$8bn a year] subsidy the province provides out of general revenues”. Those billions, Winfield says, would otherwise be spent on things like schools and hospitals, instead of “artificially” lowering electricity rates. “That accounts for the bulk of the province’s annual deficit,” he says. So does nuclear mean cheap power for Ontario? Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup First, let’s start with Ontario’s electricity mix. The province has 20 of Canada’s 22 nuclear reactors, providing about 59% of Ontario’s electricity. But comparisons of electricity prices across Canada and North America don’t show that Ontario’s nuclear-heavy generation delivers particularly cheap power. According to two analyses (here and here), Quebec, the province next door where almost all electricity comes from hydropower, gives the cheapest rates. British Columbia and Manitoba are also cheaper, and they’re also dominated by hydro. Dutton has said Ontarians “pay around about 14 cents kWh. There are parts in Australia that will be paying up to 56 cents a kilowatt hour from July 1 this year.” But making a fair comparison between Australian electricity prices and Ontario is almost impossible because – before we’ve even got to the subsidy – the structures and governance systems around electricity are very different. Almost half of Ontario’s power generation is publicly owned and the prices people pay are set by a government board. Ontarians pay for their electricity in a more sophisticated way than Australians – people can choose one of three price plans, and the price people pay for each kWh can depend, for example, on how much power they have used that month or what time of day they are using it. The cost to the customer per kWh can be as low as 3c/kWh and as high as 32c/kWh. But Winfield says the $8bn annual subsidy that helps keep those costs down is also masking the cost of refurbishing Ontario’s existing fleet of reactors that were built between the 1970s and 1990s. “Those projects have consistently run billions over budget and years behind schedule, and in some cases ended in write-offs,” Winfield says. The provincial government wants to refurbish 10 of its reactors. Winfield says the cost of those refurbs isn’t known, but his own estimates stand at about $44bn. Ontario’s government has a chequered recent history when it comes to energy policy. Critics have pointed to the province’s “horrifically expensive” nuclear reactors that helped the collapse of the publicly owned generator in the 1990s with $42bn of debt, and ratepayers were asked to repay some of that with a charge they continued to pay until 2018. In 2018, the provincial government cancelled 758 renewable projects, reportedly costing Ontarians about $250m. Winfield says Ontario’s decision to sideline renewables and back nuclear will see the province relying more on gas, which he says will push up greenhouse gas emissions. “The fundamental underlying problem, along with all of the other downsides with nuclear – waste management, major upstream impacts in terms of uranium mining and milling, security, catastrophic accident and weapons proliferation risks that just don’t exist in relation to other energy technologies – is that it hasn’t benefited from the kinds of learning curves you have seen with renewables and storage, where costs have fallen and performance improved,” he says. “Rather, nuclear costs just keep rising.” Wind myth lingers The polling company Ipsos released its annual report this week examining Australians’ attitudes to climate change and the transition from fossil fuels. They also asked Australians how “believable” they thought several pieces of misinformation, such as electric cars being as bad for the planet as fossil fuelled ones (they’re not). The list of misinformation Australians thought “believable” included a classic of its genre – that wind turbines take more energy to make than they will ever generate. Half of Australians thought this statement was either “somewhat believable” or “very believable” which, given how wrong it is, is unbelievable. This myth is very old and there have been many studies that have debunked it. In 2018 the IPCC looked at 20 studies of “energy payback time” for windfarms and found most had generated the energy it took to build them after three to eight months."

                    "bodyText": "Meta’s shares rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday off the back of a strong earnings report that comes as the company is spending heavily on AI tools. The company’s stock price grew around 5% following the report, which revealed the company outperformed analysts’ expectations for its second quarter. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, reported $39.07bn in revenue and $5.16 earnings per share. Both results outpaced market predictions of around $38bn in revenue and $4.7 per share, while the company also reported $8.47bn in capital expenditures – lower than analysts expected. “We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, claimed in a statement. “We’ve released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we’re driving good growth across our apps.” Meta also reported strong earnings in its previous quarter, but concern over its outlook for the rest of the year led the stock to fall as much as 16% before rebounding in the ensuing months. Meta’s more positive revenue forecasts on Wednesday appeared to prevent a similar outcome. Much of Meta’s recent efforts have involved developing artificial intelligence models and incorporating them into its platforms, with Zuckerberg stating earlier this year that his goal was “getting millions or billions of people to use Meta AI”. Meta released its latest AI model, called LLama 3.1 405B, earlier this month in a bid to compete with companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. The company expects that a major source of its capital expenditure growth in 2025 will be related to investments in AI, it stated in Wednesday’s earnings report. Other big tech companies have struggled in recent weeks as earnings reports have failed to show that their multibillion-dollar investments in AI are producing returns that would justify the spending. Shares in Alphabet, Tesla and Microsoft all fell following their earnings reports this month, amid a wider market rotation away from big tech stocks toward smaller companies. Earlier this week, Meta also reached a $1.4bn settlement in a Texas privacy lawsuit that alleged the company was taking users’ biometric data without their consent. The company faces another major lawsuit in New Mexico, where the state attorney general sued Meta over allegations that it failed to protect young users from child sexual exploitation."

                    "bodyText": "A new accessible blood test that can predict male infertility could soon be available for use in GP practices, researchers say. Published in the journal Scientific Reports, the research looked at data from nearly 4,000 men who underwent semen and hormone testing for male infertility from 2011-20. An AI model was developed from this that researchers said could predict male infertility risk with about 74% accuracy. It works by measuring different hormone levels in a blood sample, which are associated with sperm production. The researchers said the model could predict a severe form of infertility known as non-obstructive azoospermia – where there is no sperm in the semen – with 100% accuracy. The team believe their AI-enhanced blood test could make screening for male infertility more accessible as it can be used in GP surgeries without the need for special laboratories. Hideyuki Kobayashi, an associate professor in the department of urology at Toho University school of medicine in Japan, who led the development of the AI model, said this method was intended only as a first screening step to identify infertility and was “not a replacement for semen testing”. He added: “In the future, we hope that clinical laboratories and health check-up centres will use our AI prediction model to screen for male infertility, thereby making testing for male infertility more accessible by overcoming hurdles to it.” According to the World Health Organization, worldwide about 7% of men are affected by infertility with about half of fertility problems in a heterosexual couple coming from the man. Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Manchester, said the method could help to streamline the process of detecting male infertility. He said: “One of the first steps in diagnosing male infertility is the analysis of a sample of semen in a specialist laboratory. This will involve time off work and another appointment, sometimes at a specialist laboratory some distance away. Therefore, the idea that a first-stage diagnosis could be done from a blood sample taken by the GP does offer some advantages.” He added: “The authors of this paper have done a great job in applying artificial intelligence to the problem, but their approach would have to be simplified into some kind of app that GPs could use for it to have real-world benefit. “Clearly, the male would have to provide a semen sample for analysis, eventually, but this approach, if confirmed in a larger dataset, could help streamline the process and make it a bit more user-friendly.”"

                    "bodyText": "Teresa J Blair has a handful of cookbooks to her name. Each has a snappy, catchy title: The Ultimate Crockpot Cookbook for Beginners: A Comprehensive Guide to Slow Cooking Success for Novice Chefs, Featuring Mouthwatering Recipes, Time-Saving Tips, and Essential Techniques is a great example. Teresa has written about canning and preserving, the Mediterranean diet and anti-inflammatory recipes. Well done, Teresa. But don’t expect this cookery writer to turn up to any book signings or appear on Saturday Kitchen. It’s not that Teresa is a diva; it’s that she’s not a real person. She’s an AI. In the past couple of years, something disconcerting has been happening in the cookbook marketplace. Entire books are springing up, written by AI. In just over a week, between 2 and 14 December 2023, Teresa managed to publish four books – which means Nigel Slater will need to speed up his whisking significantly. She has a rival, as well: in January, the fictional Lillian D Stewart published five recipe books on pasta, gout food, lectin food, Mediterranean food and the dash diet. At first glance, Teresa’s books look plausible. Some people may be fooled by them. But can AI actually emulate human chefs? In 2023, Joanne Lee Molinaro noticed that, among the infuriating rip-offs of her Korean Vegan Cookbook, there was one culprit that looked almost identical to her book. Written by one “Rachael Issy”, this Korean vegan cookbook had a cover so similar that it appeared to be actually trying to deceive readers. “I knew that AI could also be used to exploit the work of others,” Molinaro wrote on her website, “that its growing utility threatened human thought and labor with their obsolescence. But it never occurred to me that ChapGPT could cut so close to my bones. And man … it hurt.” Molinaro’s many followers confirmed to her that this supposedly vegan cookbook boasted recipes featuring eggs and dairy, and even at one point suggested chicken. To head off the implication that she had written it, Molinaro threatened legal action and her followers bombarded the book’s (now deleted) Amazon page with negative reviews. “Make no mistake,” Molinaro wrote about the experience. “AI will thrive in a playground where productivity and fat margins are valued above creativity and equity.” Molinaro’s example might be an anomaly at the moment. But there are people out there working on harnessing AI for food writing. One of them is Paolo Rosson, the author of The AI Cookbook. Ominously subtitled A Taste of the Future, Rosson’s book, released in 2022, was an experiment in which he helped GPT-3 to produce AI recipes. The book’s photos, made with DALL-E, are wholly convincing. Rosson corrected some of the most glaring mistakes in the recipes – one called for two kilos of butter, for example – but he let the model do as much of the work as possible. I cook one of the book’s bizarre “fusion dishes”, flicking past “shepherd’s pie sushi” and “Thai green curry lasagna” to get to “Sri Lankan currywurst curry”. The eloquence of AI models has improved in the past two years, but it’s no surprise that the prose won’t win a Pulitzer: “Sri Lankan currywurst is a flavourful and hearty dish that makes a great main course for lunch or dinner. It pairs well with white rice and a side of green beans or another vegetable.” I choose this dish because, like a lot of AI, it makes me feel slightly queasy. I suspect that when I serve it to my family, they will order a takeaway or head to the pub. But, miraculously, the dish works. “This was actually one of my favourite recipes from the book,” says Rosson, who was similarly surprised. “I remember that, at the very beginning, when I was still fine-tuning the creation process, the AI recommended the use of bratwurst ice-cream as a side dish, which was a bit much for me.” Rosson has hit the nail on the head there: because it has never tasted the food, the AI has no idea whether what it suggests will taste good or not. Surely it can only reproduce recipes that already exist? “I wouldn’t trust an AI-generated tabbouleh recipe in the way that I would a Felicity Cloake ‘Perfect…’ recipe,” says bestselling food writer Rukmini Iyer. “An AI hasn’t cooked and tested six recipes and compared them before coming up with its own.” Having bought two of Teresa J Blair’s masterpieces, I am keen to see the inside of a pure AI book. Unfortunately, there are zero photos, just a plain list of hundreds of recipes. The Ultimate Crockpot Cookbook for Beginners is an unconventional crockpot cookbook, I discover, in that 99% of the recipes are for mojitos – not a drink known for being made with the aid of a crockpot. I make one of the 100 recipes on offer, called Gimme My Mojito! Although the formatting is a little odd – “Ingredients5”; “3fresh mint sprigs” – it’s perfectly lovely. I later discover that every single word is copied from this mojito recipe. Because you can’t copyright a formula but can copyright the specific wording of a recipe, says Ryan Abbott, the author of The Reasonable Robot: Artificial Intelligence and the Law, this means that Teresa has probably committed copyright infringement. I have an even better time with Teresa’s The Ultimate Anti-Inflammatory Cookbook for Beginners. Here I am reminded why proofreaders exist. Something in the AI processing for this book took objection to the word “and”, turning it into “&amp;;” in every instance. It inadvertently leads to beautiful phrases such as “h&amp;ful cori&amp;der” and “using an immersion blender or even by “h&amp;”. We know that AI struggles with hands, but this is ridiculous. The Japanese hotpot I attempt – not obviously anti-inflammatory, like all the other recipes – is one of the most disgusting meals I have ever eaten. Even if we ignore the gibberish instructions – “Sprinkle a little of the chilli-ginger-garlic-sesame combine true between everylayer”; “Give it a two-min simmer once it reveryes a boil before turning it” – the whole thing is a soggy, limey mess. My children barely touch it and I can see betrayal in their eyes. Thanks, Teresa. Though AI recipes can be dreadful, that won’t stop them making people a quick buck. As Matthew Kupfer pointed out in a fantastic Twitter thread on another AI crockpot book, these cookbooks can climb the Amazon rankings because the reviews themselves are written by AI, a trend becoming increasingly prevalent online. (Teresa has only ever been reviewed twice – the review is exactly the same, despite being written for two different books, and was clearly written by AI.) You can find gibberish AI recipes on YouTube as well. One channel, SuperRecipess, has 1.19 million subscribers despite being driven by AI and despite its videos being called things like “I never bought ice-cream again, I only make it like this now” and “This recipe surprised everyone for how easy and delicious breakfast can be!” While the footage itself seems real, the commentary – “And if you’re still watching this video, you’re loving our recipe!” – is almost certainly generated by AI, and the recipes are often extraordinarily disgusting. The law is playing catch-up with the rate at which AI is accelerating. But if an AI cookbook is trained on recipes that it has hoovered up from the internet and elsewhere, this might not be illegal in and of itself. “If you were writing a cookbook, you might buy other cookbooks and read them and draw inspiration from them,” Abbott says. “Training on copyrighted material has never constituted copyright infringement for a person.” Everything rests on how the word “training” is defined. Though AI cookbooks might not be hugely impressive at the moment, cook and food writer Ravneet Gill points to a dystopian future in which publishers might want 10 books on air fryer recipes generated quickly. Rather than paying an author between £30,000 and £100,000 to do so, they might simply use AI and pay a popular food writer a £10,000 endorsement fee. “It’s very dangerous,” she says. “But unfortunately it’s not going away.” As in other creative spheres of life, however, will we be happy to be dictated to by robots? Even Rosson, who wrote an entire book with AI, is sceptical. AI might be able to reproduce his grandmother’s cake recipe perfectly, but would the pleasure of eating it be as great? “If I knew that a recipe was created by AI – even if I knew that it was meant to recreate my grandmother’s cake – it would mean less to me,” he says. “Because underneath, I know that it hasn’t been made by a real person.”"

                    "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today. Here is a recap of the main news: Australia’s inflation rose as expected in the June quarter, to 3.8%, stoking hopes an RBA rate rise can be avoided. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warned that inflation was “sticky and stubborn” in his reaction to the CPI figures. The transport minister, Catherine King, said long-term solution needed for regional aviation, not ‘throwing money at the problem.’ Meanwhile, Chalmers said there have been “discussions” with Rex regarding a pathway forward for the airline. Sam Freeman, one of the administrators brought in for Rex Airlines, said the decision to stop flights between capital cities was a permanent one. A woman was bitten by a shark on an island off the coast of Western Australia, about 80km west of Geraldton. NSW police have launched an internal investigation after the video of a shark attack, in which 23-year-old Kai McKenzie lost his leg, was reportedly leaked online. The Albanese government will focus on improving job pathways for Australians with disabilities as part of a broad $371m package committed to improving lives after years of harrowing stories emerging from a royal commission. Journalists from the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday are gathering outside Nine Entertainment’s offices across the country after a five-day strike ended at 11am today. The legionnaires’ disease outbreak in Melbourne saw another rise in cases, with 40 confirmed and 6 suspected cases notified since Friday afternoon, mostly in adults aged over 40. The coalition accused the federal government of delivering a “school funding war” instead of an agreement after it released the document outlining the next 10 years of reform for the education sector. The federal government is promising to change the law to force banks to compensate Australian customers who are tricked into transferring money to scammers, accusing them of doing too little to prevent people from being duped out of more than $2bn every year. The aurora australis was observed in southern areas of the country overnight, including parts of Tasmania and Melbourne. Australians are being urged to get regular tests for sexually transmitted infections amid warnings of a significant rise in cases across the country from the peak body for pathologists. A number of weather warnings were issued for the New South Wales coast today, as a low pressure system in the southern Tasman Sea is generating large swells. Indigenous artefacts held in a Canadian museum will return to Queensland communities in a historic move towards healing. UBS ditches RBA August rate rise call in wake of inflation figures In case you missed it earlier, the June quarter inflation figures were much as the Reserve Bank (and economists) expected, landing at 3.8% compared with a year earlier. Investors who had dough on the line responded by slicing the value of the Australian dollar by about half a US cent to under 65 US cents. They were betting that the RBA wouldn’t lift its cash rate next month (and so the dollar was less attractive to hold). Similarly, stocks jumped on anticipation that company earnings won’t be slugged with higher borrowing costs. The inflation figures weren’t the only bits of news around, but much of the day’s 1.75% jump in the ASX 200 share index reflected the inflation outcome. Interestingly, all of the big four banks saw their shares rise, including about 2.5% for Westpac, while CBA reached a record close at $137.49 (up 1.1% for the day). Debt arrears and bankruptcies are typically made worse by interest rate rises, so all the better if there aren’t any more. None of the big four banks expect another RBA rate rise but predictions for the timing of the first cut range from November (Westpac and CBA) to February (ANZ) and May (NAB). We’ll see if that changes after Tuesday’s RBA board decision. Investment bank UBS had been among the hawks, predicting an August RBA rate rise. After today’s CPI figures, though, they’ve ditched that call. They are among the more pessimistic, though, when it comes to the timing of a rate. UBS doesn’t expect that to come until August 2025. Allegra Spender says government should ‘look harder’ at levers to ease cost of living Independent MP Allegra Spender has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that the government should “look harder at the levers it has” to ease the cost of living: I think this is a really tough time. I was out in the community yesterday talking to businesses across Wentworth and the cost of everything going up was on their minds. I think the government needs to look harder at the levers it has. Housing is one area where costs are going up and the federal government has more levers here, partly to give strong incentives to states to act on housing, but partly to do things like rein in its own ill-disciplined infrastructure spending because the government is spending $97bn … over the next 10 years and construction costs across the board [are] going up because of this push. You cannot build everything at the same time. Disability organisations blast ‘deeply disappointing’ joint government response to royal commission The long-awaited joint federal, state and territory response to the disability royal commission was “deeply disappointing” and “fails to respond to the scale of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability”, representative organisations have said. In a statement this afternoon, 12 major national disability representative and advocacy organisations, including People with Disability Australia and Disability Advocacy Network Australia, said the royal commission had been “a once-in-a-lifetime examination of the scale of violence so many people with disability experience and deserves and demands a response of the same scale”. In the government response, key recommendations from the commission about preventing that violence and exploitation – including national coordination, reform of disability service providers, changes to the law, increased access to support and leadership of people with disability in driving these changes – had not been adequately addressed, they said. The statement continued: There is little concrete commitment or funding for any of these areas. ... One of the most important reforms that is needed to safeguard people with disability against violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation is the establishment of a federal Human Rights Act, which our organisations support. Disappointingly, this recommendation has not been fully accepted. Separately, former NDIS board member and chief executive of disability services provider Aruma Martin Laverty said he was not surprised the federal government decided not to back most recommendations: Putting off decisions such as disability group homes and supported disability employment reflects how hard it’s become for governments to agree and implement disability reform. The sector united fifteen years ago on the NDIS. Federal-state government infighting, disability sector divisions and ballooning NDIS costs has stalled appetite for reform, and made the case for additional dollars too hard to fund. Governments and the sector need to regroup, or disability reform improvements will remain out of reach. The legionnaires’ disease outbreak in Melbourne has seen another rise in cases, with 40 confirmed and 6 suspected cases notified since Friday afternoon, mostly in adults aged over 40. VicHealth said in a statement this afternoon that most cases have required hospitalisation, with multiple admissions to intensive care for severe community acquired pneumonia. All of the cases come from people who reside in or have visited Melbourne, with adults aged over 40 most at risk, especially people with other medical conditions or immune compromise, or who smoke. Legionnaires’ disease can cause a chest infection with symptoms of fever, chills, cough, headache and muscle aches and pains. Other atypical symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and confusion. VicHealth said investigations into the source of the outbreak continue: Investigations are under way to identify the source of the outbreak through testing of local cooling towers and other potential sources. Test results indicate that the outbreak is caused by Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1, which can be detected through a legionella urinary antigen test. NSW students in years 7-10 to learn how to navigate consent in sex education overhaul Australia’s largest school system will get its biggest sex education overhaul in decades with all students learning how to seek and give consent in intimate relationships. For the first time, children in years 7-10 in NSW will learn how to navigate relations with sexual partners under mandatory curriculum changes. Students as young as 12 will learn the “skills and strategies to gain, give or deny consent” under the new physical development, health and physical education (PDHPE) syllabus, released on Wednesday. Under the previous curriculum, consent was an optional example of a topic teachers could discuss at their discretion. The education minister, Prue Car, said the topic would become an essential component of courses to be rolled out across all NSW classrooms by 2027. “For the first time ever, there will be beefed up content and knowledge on affirmative consent,” she told reporters. When asked whether religious schools would be on board with the latest syllabus, Ms Car responded: “This is the curriculum and this is what we need taught in our schools.” Age-appropriate lessons will teach that consent is “freely given, reversible, informed and specific” with communication strategies to focus on “respecting people’s choices, personal boundaries and affirmative consent”, the government said. Respectful relationships will also form a major part of material with extra lessons on how to recognise signs of coercive control, manipulation and controlling behaviours in relationships. Sex education will adopt the legal definition of consent, including that it “must be actively communicated by words or actions by both parties” and can be revoked at any time. It will also dictate that there can be no consent if the person is unconscious, asleep or affected by drugs and alcohol. – AAP Opposition says Labor and Chalmers unable to tame ‘Labor’s homegrown inflation’ The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, and opposition treasury spokesperson, Angus Taylor, were speaking to reporters earlier this afternoon and responding to the release of CPI figures earlier. Taylor said the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was “out of his depth” in his battle against inflation, calling it “Labor’s homegrown inflation”: We see that headline inflation is up, core inflation is stuck around 4%, well above target, and in particular, it’s very clear this is homegrown inflation. This is Labor’s homegrown inflation, inflicting pain on every Australian household. Non-tradable inflation – that’s domestic inflation – is running at 5% and tradable at only 1.5%. It’s very clear here that this is Labor’s homegrown inflation. It’s important to note that this inflation is above the forecast in particular of Treasury, well above the Treasury headline forecast, which the treasurer was crowing about some time back. The truth of the matter is that this is a treasurer who’s out of touch and out of his depth when it comes to beating inflation in this country. This is Labor’s failure to tame the inflation which is inflicting so much pain on Australians. Qantas to help Rex passengers rebook flights, transport minister says The transport minister, Catherine King, told reporters earlier today the government would “work very closely with administrators” and that Rex’s continued operation is in “the best interest of regional Australians”. She said she had also spoken with the CEO of Qantas in a bid to support passengers affected by Rex entering voluntary administration yesterday: This morning I have also spoken to Vanessa Hudson, the CEO of Qantas. They are also offering passengers impacted by these events the ability to rebook on their services at no additional cost where seats are available on those intercity routes. In terms of Rex’s regional fleet, these flights are continuing to operate as scheduled and that is a relief, I know, for many in regional communities, given the importance of those routes. Rex’s continuation is in the best interest of regional Australians, the travelling public, its workers, and the aviation sector more broadly. The government will work very closely with the administrators to ensure a strong regional aviation presence in the future. My department has already met with the administrators today and will continue to engage with those, the administrators are also briefing state and territory governments today and my department will do the same through transport portfolios as well. The government will act expeditiously but we will also be acting carefully in this space. It is a complex situation with multiple commercial arrangements in place but we do stand ready to work very closely with the administrators because that regional presence is absolutely vital. Northern Territory signs public school funding deal with commonwealth The education minister, Jason Clare, says today is a “landmark day” as the Northern Territory becomes the first jurisdiction to sign a bilateral agreement to reach full funding with the commonwealth. Speaking in the NT, Clare said the agreement would double the investment the federal government made in the territory’s public schools, seeing it reach full funding by 2029. Under current settings, Northern Territory public schools weren’t expected to receive their full funding until the middle of the century. This fixes that and brings it forward by more than 20 years. The NT chief minister, Eva Lawler, said students in public schools were going to be, on average, $33,000 better off. This funding boost means more resources where they are needed, including extra teachers, better infrastructure and additional support to students who need it most. The NT is the only jurisdiction to be offered 40% funding towards public schools due to its additional need, with Clare proposing to increase funding for remaining states and territories by 2.5% to 22.5%. The Coalition has accused the federal government of delivering a “school funding war” instead of an agreement after it released the document outlining the next 10 years of reform for the education sector. The agreement released today has been backed by the Northern Territory and Western Australia, while the remaining states and territories, which will have until September to sign it, have been calling on the commonwealth to increase its funding share by 5%. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, has put 2.5% on the table. The shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, says while the draft agreement proposes a number of important reforms, including evidence-based teaching, screening tests and improved targets, it is light on specifics. Jason Clare is embroiled in a full-blown school funding war and has botched the opportunity to deliver the national reforms every child needs to reach his or her best potential. The Greens spokesperson on primary and secondary education, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, says the agreement locks in public school underfunding for a decade and fails to provide a coherent roadmap. The education minister is waving the mission accomplished flag while teachers are fleeing the system, student disengagement and school can’t/school refusal is rising and cashed-up private schools draw more and more kids out of the public system. Industry calls for $3bn fund to clean dirty big trucks Australia’s heavy-duty transport industry is calling for a $3bn national fund to invest in low-emission vehicles and ensure drivers can keep on trucking in a net-zero era, AAP reports. The National Road Transport Association has revealed its proposal, arguing a Clean Transport Fund would be needed to help businesses of all sizes invest in electric vehicles, install charging infrastructure and investigate hydrogen-fuelled options. The group’s suggestion comes in the latest submission to the federal government’s Transport and Infrastructure Net Zero Consultation Roadmap, which closes to submissions next week. It also comes one week after a government inquiry was told Australia’s move to low-emission transport could be delayed by the price of electric trucks, even though drivers and residents preferred them. The National Road Transport Association chief executive, Warren Clark, said current plans to cut transport emissions fell short of supporting the trucking industry despite the nation’s reliance on freight: Australia’s roadmap to net zero is not on track, risking our climate targets and pushing the industry into crisis. A $3bn Clean Transport Fund is a reasonable request considering the significant public benefits such as lower emissions and health costs. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Mostafa Rachwani will now take the reins and bring you the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care! Shadow treasurer says Australians ‘losing hope’ amid latest inflation figures The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, spoke with the media earlier this afternoon after the latest consumer pride index figures were released for June. As Peter Hannam reports, inflation rose to 3.8% amid hopes the Reserve Bank would hold off hiking interest rates again: Taylor described the figures as “a terrible set of numbers for Australian households”. In these numbers we see headline inflation is up, core inflation is stuck around 4% – well above target – and in particular it’s very clear this is homegrown inflation … Australians are losing hope, they are increasingly demoralised, they cannot see a pathway back to the restoration of their standard of living … There appears to be no pathway back and it’s understandable so many Australians are losing hope … Taylor said food prices were up 11.3% in the last two years, housing up 14.6%, rent up 14.9% and electricity up 21.6%. Bushwalker’s body recovered after fall on ‘mecca’ hike The body of a New Zealand man who died on a “mecca for hikers” trek in rugged south-west Tasmania has been recovered, AAP reports. The 27-year-old, who was living in Melbourne, set off on the 72km Eastern Arthur Range Traverse on 16 July. He planned to complete the six-to-nine-day walk on 20-21 July, but was reported missing by a friend after not making contact. Search crews discovered the man’s body last Wednesday near the 1,224-metre-high Federation Peak. It is believed he fell from a “significant” height. Tasmania police have said his body was recovered by a helicopter and winch team on Monday: Due to the challenging terrain and weather conditions the retrieval was not possible until this time. Police would like to thank all parties involved for their assistance in relation to this challenging recovery. Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time, and we thank them for their patience and understanding. Melburnians still feeling the chill We mentioned earlier that today may end up being Melbourne’s coldest day of the year so far. As at 2.30pm, the temperature in the capital city was 8.6C – cracking the 8C mark in the last half hour. Melbourne did not hit 7C until after midday today, and the lowest maximum temperature of the year so far was 10.1C on 13 June. Yesterday’s maximum temperature for the day was recorded at about 2.30pm, so we’ll keep an eye on how the temperature may change this afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology is warning of a strong cold front, bringing heavy rain and damaging winds to Western Australia: Indigenous artefacts held in a Canadian museum will return to Queensland communities in a historic move towards healing, AAP reports. The state government reached an agreement with the Museum of Vancouver to begin the process of repatriating Indigenous items to the Queensland Museum. There are between six and 12 items to be returned, including animal skins, message sticks, woomeras, a rainforest sword, fighting and throwing clubs and secret and sacred objects. After the items arrive back in Australia, they will be cared for by the Queensland Museum for a short period before being returned to communities. The treaty minister, Leeanne Enoch, told budget estimates today: The repatriation of ancestral remains, secret sacred objects and significant cultural heritage to country, community is a basic human right and a crucial healing and reconciliation journey of Queensland. Several other international museums are also in talks with the Queensland government to return sacred items including London’s Natural History Museum and the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Enoch said the Sheffield Museum in the UK had proactively reached out to begin the repatriation process. The Queensland Museum cares for 1,394 ancestral remains and secret sacred objects. Australia should ratify UN charter for people with disabilities, advocate says The president of People with Disability Australia, Marayke Jonkers, also spoke to the media from Brisbane after the government responded to the disability royal commission this morning. Jonkers called for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to be implemented, either through a disability rights act or human rights act. We realise there is some debate about that, but the end result of making sure that there is recourse for disabled people when there is neglect, abuse are not being included in society is pivotal to … moving forwards. At a press conference earlier today, the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, took questions on this and noted the debate about whether a disability or human rights act was preferred. You can read about this earlier in the blog here. Disability groups react to government’s response to royal commission The leaders of Australia’s disability representative organisations have been speaking to the media from Brisbane, after the government handed down its response to the disability royal commission earlier this morning: The CEO of Down Syndrome Australia, Darryl Steff, noted that the government accepted 13 recommendations in full and committed to a further 117 – but said “there is very little detail about how the commitment will work”. Pointing to a few specific areas, Steff said it was “disappointing” the government had not committed to ending segregation in education. The importance of ending segregated education is reflected in how that flows through to the employment. The disability royal commission heard that it is very rare for people who are in segregated education to end up in full open employment. Therefore, reform is needed. He also expressed disappointment that the government did not commit to ending low wages for those with disability: It is still allowed to pay people with disability in segregated employment as low as $4 an hour. Nobody in Australia would think that is acceptable and we call on the government to end that immediately. Person rushed to hospital after incident at wave pool A person has been rushed to hospital after being found in the water at a wave pool in Sydney. A NSW ambulance spokesperson said it was called to reports of a person found in the water at about noon. Paramedics treated the person at the scene and then transported them to Concord hospital. No further details about their condition was available. The Daily Telegraph reported that the incident took place at URBNSURF wave park at Sydney Olympic Park. What compensation will banks owe to scam victims under proposed code? At the National Press Club, Stephen Jones has been quizzed about what compensation a bank may owe to its customers if they have been scammed. Asked what a bank would have to do to be liable, or to pay a victim back, he responds: If a customer has reported that they see transactions on their account and they want their account frozen and the bank doesn’t do that, and transactions continue to occur on their account, that would be a clear example … of where something has gone wrong. Jones says banks would have an obligation to report suspicious activity to the scam centre, under the proposed code. I want to be very clear on this: nobody gets a free pass here … I just think we won’t get the best result if we take the lazy approach and just say, ignore the rails on which all of these scams are occurring. Ignore the means by which they are being sent to your mobile phone, ignore the means by which they are popping up on your screen, through a platform or digital device, ignore all of that – let’s just focus on the payment at the end. That’s not a prevention approach … that’s an approach that says ‘patch it up after it’s all gone wrong’. Greens urge government to address ‘ballooning’ student debt amid warning some are being forced to quit studies The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, has urged the federal government to address “ballooning” student debt. This comes as the new vice-chancellor of Western Sydney University, Prof George Williams, has warned that students are being forced to quit their studies due to soaring costs. Faruqi said in a statement that she was “not surprised” students were dropping out of their studies because “everyone knows ballooning student debt is making students rethink university”. Labor is refusing to urgently scrap the disgraceful, punitive fee hikes of the Coalition’s job-ready graduates package which is making the student debt crisis much worse. [Education] minister [Jason] Clare has been in office for two years, what is he waiting for? The burden of unsustainable, growing student debts is enormous, from locking young people out of the housing market to crushing dreams of further study and stopping people from starting a family. Faruqi said Labor’s student debt relief policy was “laughable” and would still mean student debts rising by 11.5% in their first term of government, and arts degrees costing more than $50,000. Jones fears scammers will use AI-deepfakes to impersonate loved ones Back to the National Press Club: the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has been talking about the need to combat AI-deepfakes before they are used to scam people. He says: We are developing the legislation right now [around deepfakes], hoping we are able to get it into parliament as soon as possible – it is a priority of the prime minister. It will be a game changer … The threat will evolve as technology changes. Artificial intelligence … it brings lots of benefits – I don’t talk about it in dystopian terms either – but we know already that it is then used to create deepfakes of celebrities promoting investment scams. Can you imagine the danger that will follow when they start to impersonate you or your loved ones? Is it Melbourne’s coldest day of the year? My Victorian colleagues have reliably informed me that it is very cold in Melbourne today! The capital city was yet to crack 7C by 12pm, and is currently sitting at around 7.6C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. The lowest maximum temperature of the year so far was 10.1C on 13 June – so the city hasn’t had a single-digit maximum yet. Yesterday’s maximum temperature was reached at about 2.30pm, so there’s still a few hours for things to warm up – we’ll be keeping an eye on it. Scammers set up fake online funeral for late Labor MP and charged attenders, Jones says Back at the National Press Club in Canberra, where the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has been speaking. Jones has been detailing the extent to which scams have been growing in Australia – and how methods are becoming more insidious. He says that scammers are preying on people’s natural instincts, including the desire to love and be loved, with around $5.7m lost to dating and romance scams in the first quarter of this year alone. Jones then shares a personal story from the funeral of the late Labor MP Peta Murphy earlier this year: There was a big funeral, a lot of people could not get there, so the answer … was establishing a video connection into the funeral. Scammers set up on a Facebook page, a fake attendance into the funeral and were charging people to attend. That’s an insight into the morality of the people we are dealing with. [It angers me] that people can be taken advantage of in a moment of vulnerability. I’m sure you all feel the same. Australians, however, don’t want the government just to do nothing, they want us to turn that anger into action. Murphy, 50, died from breast cancer late last year. As the member for Dunkley, she was remembered for the landmark Murphy report which recommended a phased, comprehensive ban on online gambling advertising within three years. There are a number of weather warnings in place for the New South Wales coast today, as a low pressure system in the southern Tasman Sea is generating large swells. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, very heavy surf is possible along almost the entire coast of NSW today and tomorrow morning – which could lead to localised damage and coastal erosion. Damaging surf conditions are expected to gradually ease from the south during this afternoon, the BoM said, with conditions easing by tomorrow morning. Hazardous surf warnings are in place for the Byron, Coffs, Macquarie, Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, Batemans and Eden coasts. A marine wind warning is also in place for much of the coast. Dallas Kilponen, a freelance photographer, has captured this photo of a giant set wave at Maroubra in Sydney’s eastern suburbs this morning: Social media summit to reveal evidence for teen ban bid The evidence supporting the South Australian government’s move to ban social media accounts for young teenagers will be detailed at a joint summit in Sydney and Adelaide in October, AAP reports. Responding to mounting concern about the adverse impact of social media on children, the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, appointed a former high court chief justice in May to examine how his government could effectively impose a social media ban on teenagers under 14. Since then, premiers of NSW, Queensland and Victoria have also declared support for restricting children’s access to social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Today, Malinauskas and the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said their joint summit would bring together senior officials, policymakers and academics, as well as representatives of leading social media platforms and digital technologies. Minns has said he wants to increase the minimum age of social media users to 16. The NSW government will host the first day of the summit at the ICC Sydney on 10 October, with the SA government hosting the second day in Adelaide on 11 October. It will inform policies and explore themes including formulating a public health response, addressing social media harms in schools, understanding the role of social media in identity, belonging and worldviews, and unpacking links between extremism, misogyny and social media. Union calls for government to cover staff entitlements of Rex employees The United Services Union is calling for the federal government to step in and cover staff entitlements of Rex workers. In a statement, the union said Rex workers had been told they would miss out on legal entitlements by administrators, despite the airline continuing to trade. The union’s general secretary, Graeme Kelly, said that as late as the weekend, staff were working overtime and on RDOs “when Rex bosses must have known they fully intended to sack them”. Rex management could have been in contact with us months ago and brought us into discussions, but instead they chose to wait until the airline goes belly up and there is nothing we could do to help. And on top of that they’ve left no money to pay their workers, the union is ropable about this. The Albanese government needs to step in and make sure these workers are looked after. The union will now be working with the administrator to try to ensure our members’ entitlements are protected and to save as many jobs as possible. Assistant treasurer speaks about the rise in scams The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has just begun speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra about the rise in scams. We’ll bring you the highlights from his speech, but in the meantime, our political editor Karen Middleton brought us the key takeaways earlier this morning: Australians are being urged to get regular tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) amid warnings of a significant rise in cases across the country from the peak body for pathologists. The Royal College of Pathologists – specialist doctors trained in laboratory techniques used to test for disease – said gonorrhoea cases have risen nearly 20% from 2022 to 2023, while syphilis diagnoses have tripled over the past 10 years. Despite a concerning rise in cases of gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV, “we are not seeing a corresponding increase in testing rates,” the college spokesperson and medical director of Southern IML Pathology, Associate Prof Caitlin Keighley, said. This includes older adults who may not be forthcoming about changes in their sexual practices. Low testing levels mean that infections can go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to severe health complications and further transmission. This leaves many individuals unknowingly at risk and is particularly concerning for pregnant women, where untreated STIs can result in congenital infections with devastating outcomes. Regular testing is crucial to early detection, effective treatment, and preventing the spread of these infections. The college emphasises increased testing is essential for gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV to detect infections early, initiate appropriate treatment, and prevent the spread of STIs. They emphasise gonorrhoea has emerged as a leading cause of antibiotic-resistant infections, which complicates treatment and thereby makes early detection especially important for its management. Treasurer speaks to media after release of CPI figures The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media after the release of June’s consumer price index figures. Asked if he expects the RBA to make a cut before the end of the year, he responds: I don’t pre-empt decisions made by the Reserve Bank. They will consider these numbers today – but not just these numbers, they will consider the broader conditions in the economy as well. Headline inflation is precisely what the Reserve Bank forecast up to the June quarter – underlying inflation is moderating. They will weigh all that up along with the weakness that we have seen in the economy, the softening around the edges of the labour market … I am not in the business of giving free advice to the independent Reserve Bank, my job is to manage the budget responsibly along with my colleagues in the cabinet and in the government to deliver those big surpluses – which the Reserve Bank governor has herself said is helping in that fight against inflation – but also to roll out this cost-of-living relief in a way that makes a meaningful difference in household budgets, but also puts downward pressure on prices in a way that the ABS has confirmed today is effective. Inflation data points to higher rents with food prices still hurting households While the markets were pretty emphatic about what the inflation numbers mean – another RBA rate rise is less likely after today’s data – there’s a literal shopping list of reasons why households might still be doing it tough. Fruit and veg prices were up 6.3%, the most in a quarter since 2016, the ABS’s Michelle Marquardt said. Grapes, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes and capsicums were among products facing “unfavourable growing conditions”. Housing, too, was higher thanks to a 2% rise in rents for the quarter amid low vacancy rates just about everywhere. That compared with a 2.1% rental increase in the March quarter, with rents up 7.3% from a year earlier. If you were in the market for a new home, by contrast, the annual increase was 5.1%. Energy rebates helped curb price increases, but electricity prices were still 6% higher than a year earlier. Without the government handouts, the increase would have been 14.6%. Anyway, the relief will be that overall inflation wasn’t higher. Krishna Bhimavarapu, the APAC economist at State Street Global Advisors, said: The data reiterates our view that the interest rates are restrictive enough in Australia, and the next move by the RBA could very likely be a cut in November 2024. We think a rate hike at this stage is less likely and could tip the economy into a deeper downturn. A November rate cut was the tip by CBA and Westpac too, while NAB and ANZ had predicted the first cut won’t come until next year. Let’s see how those forecasts go. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has reacted to the June CPI figures by reiterating that inflation is “sticky and stubborn”. Taking to X to respond to the figures, Chalmers said the figures were “broadly in line” with expectations and that underlying inflation remained “moderate”: Today’s figures show that inflation is broadly in line with the RBA’s forecasts and that underlying inflation is continuing to moderate, which tells us the general direction of price pressures is downwards. Inflation is still sticky and stubborn across our economy, and more persistent than we would like, but the June quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of lower annual trimmed mean inflation in Australia. Just 39% of funding for public health and prevention projects actually went to this area, study finds Just 39% of government research funding allocated for public health and prevention projects actually went towards this type of research, a study co-led by the Public Health Association of Australia has found. Of $238.8m in funding granted by the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to The Preventive and Public Health Research Initiative, $89.9m went to non-public health research, compared to $92.9m that went to public health. A further $55.9m was for projects where insufficient information was available to enable categorisation of the type of research being undertaken. Researchers say that the findings, published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, show that public health and prevention research is taking a back seat to clinical cures and treatment, placing increasing pressure on the health system. The paper co-author Associate Prof Leanne Coombe, from the University of Queensland, said: One of the most ironic and concerning findings related to project funding granted through the MRFF’s specific ‘Preventive and Public Health Research’ Initiative. Counterintuitively, less than half of the research projects funded under this Initiative were actually public health-focused. This translates to less than 40c in every $1 spent in this Initiative truly going to public health and prevention. The MRFF has 22 funded initiatives. Overall, the study found that only 57% of the 249 projects and around half of the funding granted through the six public health-related initiatives included in the study was for genuine public health research. ‘The O word’: PM debates who can and cannot say ‘Olympics’ on breakfast radio The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, made a surprise appearance on the Kyle and Jackie O show earlier this morning, where an interesting conversation about who can and cannot say the word “Olympics” ensued. Here’s how it unfolded: Albanese: How are you enjoying the Olympics? Jackie O: Oh, you’re not allowed to say that word. You’re gonna get censored. Albanese: I am allowed to say that word! Cooper Johns: You just told the prime minister he can’t say the ‘O’ word. Jackie O: Well, I don’t know, honestly. Like, we’re not allowed to say the ‘O’ word. It is the weirdest thing. We get legal letters because of rights. And so we have to refer to it as the Games. Are you pardoning us? Albanese: They can get over themselves. Australians are allowed to talk about the Olympics and the Paralympics, which are coming up. Jackie O: Thank you! Albanese: It’s an important thing and no one owns it. The whole of Australia owns our Australian team. Another gold medal for the Aussies is fantastic. More on the consumer price index for June Financial markets assessed the chance of another rate rise as unlikely, sending the Australian dollar diving about 0.4 US cents to 64.9 US cents immediately after the release. The stock market also perked up about half a percentage point, building on morning gains, to be almost 1.1% higher for the day. For the quarter on quarter figures, CPI rose 1%, in line with both the March quarter and market expectations. Adding to the confidence that the RBA won’t have to raise the cash rate again was core inflation. The trimmed mean measure, as it is known, eased to 0.8% for the quarter and 3.9% at an annual pace. A modest decline from 1% and 4% in the March quarter but heading in the direction the RBA wants it to move. Australia’s borrowers have a nervous week ahead after June quarter inflation quickened but largely as the Reserve Bank had expected, giving the central bank confidence it won’t need to hike interest rates again to curb price rises. The consumer price index rose to 3.8% in the June quarter from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has just said. That result compared with economists’ forecast of 3.8% and the March quarter rate of 3.6%. Taking questions from reporters, Jeff Browne comments on the culture at the football club: We opened ourselves up for external investigation and those findings were part of the Do Better report. We took them seriously and when I came in as president, I committed to prosecuting and implementing all 18 recommendations and we did that. Racism and discrimination is a fight that goes on day by day and it never ends. It is something we are conscious of here. The culture in this place – as a result of adopting the recommendations of the Do Better report – have vastly improved, and it is a culture where people feel safe, people of diverse backgrounds feel safe and they feel safe to make complaints if they choose. It is put to him that an Indigenous person has come forward and said they were subject to racial slurs while an employee. Browne responds: “That is the allegation.” That is an allegation. One of the great things about democracies [is] you can make whatever allegations you like. I urge you to wait and see how the proceedings play out. Collingwood president speaks to media after allegations of racial discrimination at club The Collingwood president, Jeff Browne, is speaking to the media after allegations of racial discrimination at the football club. He says an external expert in workplace relations delivered a report to him, finding there was no illegal conduct identified in the complaint. Following that, the complainant lodged an application in the Fair Work Commission and there was a mediation, and the mediation was unsuccessful in resolving the matter, and as a consequence of that the complainant has now issued proceedings in the federal court. We intend to defend those proceedings and see those through to a judgement. Browne says the core of the defence will be “the substance of the factual findings contained in the investigation”. Rex’s exit from intercity routes will be missed by this passenger Much of the focus on Rex Airlines going into administration has rightly focussed on the threat to regional services given the few air options in much of the country. But as a frequent Sydney-Melbourne flyer, I’m one passenger who’ll miss having an alternative to Qantas and Virgin. The ticket was so reliably cheaper than its much bigger rivals, most times I didn’t even bother to compare. I also can’t recall any cancellations and only a rare delay of an hour or so at the most – an experience I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed elsewhere. And unlike the now defunct Tiger Air, I was never charged excessive amounts for going over 7kg or whatever the carry-on maximum allowed. Rex planes were clean, seats spacious enough, and staff friendly and efficient – may the latter land new jobs quickly. The inconvenience of a longer schlep to Tullamarine’s Terminal 4 was minor. A flight south in June that was barely a third full – and the return only slightly busier – was one hint not all was well. The few business seats at the front of the plane were usually empty or filled with cattle-class customers lucky to be near the counter when free upgrades were divvied out. (I got at least one.) An almost certain outcome is that the cost of flying will now take off. As the ACCC noted in its latest quarterly aviation report, in the wake of smaller rival Bonza‘s demise: Without Bonza, the prospects for a more competitive domestic aviation industry in coming years would rely more heavily on Rex expanding its offering. Well, we know what those prospects look like now. Victorian unexplained wealth bill passes parliament A bill that will force organised criminals to repay any wealth they cannot prove was lawfully acquired has passed Victorian parliament. The government’s confiscation amendment (unexplained wealth) bill – designed to deprive criminals of the “use and enjoyment of their unexplained wealth” – has passed parliament and will go to the governor for royal assent. The bill had to return to the lower house after the government made some minor amendments in the upper house, including the addition of a provision that will allow the law to be reviewed within three years of it coming into effect. The new laws will allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to a court for an order if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person’s total wealth exceeds their lawfully acquired wealth by at least $200,000. If a person can’t satisfy a court that they have lawfully obtained their wealth, a court may order them to pay the state the value of anything they cannot prove was lawfully acquired. The laws have been modelled on those currently in place in Western Australia, but are also similar to New South Wales’ laws, which were also bolstered in 2023 to allow police to seize and freeze wealth and assets without a specific offence. Sam Freeman, one of the administrators brought in for Rex Airlines, spoke with ABC TV just a moment ago about the future of the airline. Since being appointed yesterday, Freeman said the priority has been around keeping regional and remote routes connected: We have had to make a tough decision in grounding the 737 capital city-connecting flights. That is a permanent decision. He said the federal government has been in open communication with administrators and expressed a “strong desire” to see regional and remote flights continue: As to what that level of support looks like, it is simply too early to say … There is a lot to be done in the coming weeks but we are confident with the support that has been shown and that we will be able to move forward with the restructure of Rex [and] come out with its legacy business, the core regional business, into the future. Daily needs of regional families must be considered amid Rex Airlines discussions, Victorian premier says Asked what sort of intervention she would like to see, Jacinta Allan said it was up to the federal government. She went on: What the federal government decides to do, that is a matter for the federal government. But again, I would urge in their considerations, to think about the importance of good, strong transport connections for regional communities　… Country people rely on strong transport links … and I hope that has been considered in terms of what the federal government may be considering in terms of the response to this real instability and disruption. There’s been a lot of discussion in the last couple of days about what it means for people going on holidays and yes, it is really disruptive, and I know if you’ve packed your bags and you’re heading off with a family on a holiday, that is disruptive and disappointing. But what should also be front of mind is the daily need for these sorts of services for regional families and communities. Victorian premier urges federal government to support Rex Airlines The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is urging the federal government to consider supporting Rex Airlines and ensure regional Victorians have access to transport options. She was speaking to reporters at parliament earlier this morning and said: I know just how important having that transport access is, particularly for people who don’t have the ability to own a car or drive a car – whether it’s train services, bus services, or in this instance, air services. These are absolutely vital connections for country people, for country families, being able to travel into the bigger cities for various hospital or education or other appointments. So it’s absolutely important that the needs of country people are considered as Rex goes through this obviously very difficult period, and that is [why] I would urge the federal government to consider the impact on regional communities around Victoria and around the country because these sorts of services are, for some, a vital lifeline. June quarter consumer price index numbers to be released at 11.30am Aest Continuing from our last post: If the market consensus is right about the latter – a 4% reading or higher – the odds of an interest rate rise next week will almost certainly soar. Ahead of today’s numbers, the chance of a cash rate rise of 25 basis points to 4.6% is only one in four, according to the ASX rates tracker. For households and businesses on the financial edge, another hike - the 14th since May 2022 - would be a blow. However, a moderate headline and core inflation result will go a long way to removing the risk of another rate rise and bring a rate cut this year into prospect. (Currently, the market is only fully pricing in a 25bp cut to 4.1% by next July - a year away.) As we note in this piece today, the latter outcome might also bring forward a federal election to this year if the Albanese government thinks the cost of living squeeze will abate and the economy can start to pick up some growth pace without a recession: In other words, a lot is riding on today’s figures. Stay tuned right here for the results. Inflation figures to be focus for borrowers, the RBA and politicians There’s a lot of hype around today’s inflation figures from the ABS – and most of it is warranted. At 11.30am Aest, we’ll get the June quarter consumer price index numbers, and there’s a lot riding on them, as we noted earlier this week. Economists are expecting headline (i.e. raw) CPI to come in at 3.8%, higher than the March quarter of 3.6%. The quarter on quarter CPI should remain at 1%. The RBA’s own model from May had CPI ticking up to 3.8%, so a number around that should encourage the board to leave its cash rate unchanged for a sixth consecutive meeting when it meets next Monday and Tuesday (with the verdict given at 2.30pm Aest on the Tuesday). A lot of attention, though, will be on the core inflation, known as trimmed mean, which knocks off the top 15% and bottom 15% of volatile price movers. This is really more of the Reserve Bank‘s focus. They also expected this to come in at 3.8% for the June quarter but economists reckon this will land at 4.0% (or unchanged from the March quarter level). More to come in a moment. Shorten: government has no ‘final view’ on group homes Asked about group homes, Bill Shorten said the government doesn’t “have a final view”. Without being definitive about the future of group homes, what we’re doing is we want to make sure the money that is given to people in supported, independent living focuses on quality outcomes for them … But we are moving towards where people live … fulfilling lives of meaning and if that sometimes means they live with two other people, fine. If it means – dependant on their needs – that that is not the best arrangement for them, then we’ll be looking at that as well. He noted that the issue of group homes was one of three areas where the royal commission was divided. Q: What impact will this have on the plan to halve the growth rate of the NDIS? Bill Shorten said this would “not have a negative impact at all on our reform plans.” Our reform plans – with the legislation currently held up by the Liberals and the Greens in the Senate – will help the very people who the disability royal commission says should be helped. The problem at the moment is that the NDIS legislation is loose, it has some loopholes, which is seeing some service providers – the majority are excellent – but some are having a lend of the system, exploiting people with disability, getting people to spend up their valuable packages in inappropriate ways, or too quickly. So, I just say to the Liberals and the Greens – we need to get on with it. People with disability, the very people who this disability royal commission is aimed at, it’s in their best interests that we make sure the NDIS is a consistent, fair, transparent and equitable experiences, that’s what this legislation is aimed at doing. Rishworth asked about human rights act v disability rights act Taking questions, Amanda Rishworth was asked about a recommendation for a disability rights act. She said that at the same time, there has been work ongoing towards a potential human rights act: There is mixed views in the disability community about whether they would prefer a disability rights act, or for disability to be embedded in a human rights act … One of the things that we want to get on with, though, as government works through those issues, is to modernise the disability discrimination act … It’s been 15 years since any substantive work has been done on modernising that act, so that’s work that we’ll undertake immediately, while we do the sequencing work on a human rights act versus a disability rights act. Health minister speaks on royal disabillity commission report The health minister, Mark Butler, is next to address the media. He said he cannot recall a royal commission report to government that has “been this complex and has covered as many portfolio areas as this one has.” We don’t begin this response to the royal commission with a blank sheet of paper. We have in our two years of government been [working] very steadfastly across different portfolio areas to improve conditions for Australians living with disability. NDIS minister thanks all who worked on royal disability commission The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, is also speaking to the media as the government responds to the disability royal commission. He said: We are making clear we agree with many of the recommendations, and we’ve got to think about a few more of the issues that are raised there … I thank again all the people who worked on the Disability royal commission. This is another watershed moment to stop the abuse of our fellow Australians, but there’s a lot of work to go on from here, but I believe this will signpost the directions we seek to take as a nation and the better treatment and true equality of people with disability in Australia. Six-monthly progress reporting, and annual update, on implementation of recommendations Amanda Rishworth said all governments would remain accountable through a six-monthly public reporting on the implementation of recommendations and any progress made. There will also be an annual update provided to national cabinet, she said. Four key pillars to governments response to disability royal commission Amanda Rishworth said that four key pillars that will be central to the government’s response have emerged: better safeguarding; promoting inclusion and accessibility; upholding human rights; and recognising the unique perspectives and experiences of First Nations people with disability. She said: These are all areas that people with disability have continuously highlighted as important, and will drive the focus of our government as we progress reform towards a more inclusive Australia … We will progress in implementation [of the recommendations] and it will be continue to be open and transparent, in partnership with people with disability. Rishworth says commonwealth and states are ‘absolutely committed’ to sustain ‘long-term meaningful change’ Amanda Rishworth said the commonwealth and state and territory governments had “worked together, in most cases, to form a common position on recommendations where there’s joint responsibility.” And we are absolutely committed to continuing this work in order to sustain long-term meaningful change for people with disability. She said the government is “absolutely committed to the vision set out in the disability royal commission” and committed to “enabling policy and delivering services that realises the vision of an Australian community where people with disability are free from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.” As Sarah Basford Canales reported just a moment ago, the federal government agreed to 13 recommendations in full, while 117 have been accepted in principle. It is considering another 36 and has noted six recommendations. Amanda Rishworth says disability commission ‘momentous piece of work’ The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, is speaking to the media after the government handed down its response to the disability royal commission. She described the royal commission as a “a key moment in our nation’s history”, with evidence received from 10,000 people over four and a half years. It was a momentous piece of work. What was uncovered was confronting, shocking, and often incredibly disturbing. Circumstances of appalling abuse were revealed, that have absolutely no place in our country, and quite frankly, anywhere … Following on from the previous post, here’s a list of the funding set aside as part of the Albanese government’s initial response to last year’s royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability. Rights and Anti-Discrimination $6.9m to review and modernise the Disability Discrimination Act; $39.7m to establish a new disability advocacy program; $12.1m to amend the Migration Health Requirement to be fairer and more inclusive for children with disability; Safety $15.6m to unify national disability quality and safeguarding arrangements; $4.4m for consistent approaches to community visitor schemes as a safeguarding mechanism; $2.6m for the continued delivery of the National Disability Abuse and Neglect Hotline and the Complaints Resolution and Referral Service; $2m towards improving the safety of women and girls with disability; $1.2m to develop targets to reduce and eliminate restrictive practices; Inclusion and Access $12.3m to improve national approaches to accessible information and communications, including Auslan; $3.7m to continue the Primary Care Enhancement Program for People with Intellectual Disability; $19.6m to support grassroots efforts to improve community attitudes around disability Employment $23.3m to establish a Disability Employment Centre of Excellence; $227.6m to implement a new specialist disability employment program; The Albanese government will focus on improving job pathways for Australians with disabilities as part of a broad $371m package committed to improving lives following years of harrowing stories emerging from a royal commission. The final report of the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability was released last year, shedding light on the harm, exclusion and discrimination many experience. Of the report’s 222 recommendations, which spanned 12 volumes and had more than 5,000 pages, the federal government agreed to 13 recommendations in full, while 117 have been accepted in principle. It is considering another 36 and has noted six recommendations. The lion’s share of the initial funding – $227.6m – will go toward designing a specialist disability program announced in the May budget. It will help those with disabilities to prepare for, find, and maintain suitable jobs. Another $23.3m is earmarked to create a disability employment centre of excellence to help providers deliver effective employment services. Almost $7m will be set aside to review the Disability Discrimination Act with the aim of modernising rules that have not been substantially changed since 2009. Another $39.7m will go toward redesigning and streamlining the national disability advocacy program to offer information and support to those in the community. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said: We are committed to continued and sustained effort across all jurisdictions, and all levels of government, to ensure the implementation of agreed recommendations leads to real and lasting change for people with disability. Workers at Rex have been briefed by administrators determining the airline’s future that 610 jobs at the airline could be axed, according to the Transport Workers Union (TWU). Rex’s 737 services between capital cities have been grounded, with the flights ceasing to operate and resulting in 360 redundancies, according to the TWU. A further 250 job losses have also been indicated elsewhere in the business that employed about 2,000 people before entering administration. TWU’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said: This is another dark day for aviation, with over 600 families faced with sudden joblessness in an industry that has taken hit after hit. South Australian premier weighs in on Rex Airlines administration The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said the situation with Rex Airlines is “quite disappointing”. Speaking with ABC News Breakfast earlier, he noted there would be a “lot of people disappointed”, particularly in regional areas. Naturally, we’re relieved to learn that most of the regional routes will be maintained. That’s certainly the case in South Australia – we’re very dependent upon it. South Australia is a sparsely populated state on a land mass bigger than France and Germany combined. So, we actually rely on this airline [and] the maintenance of the routes is a good thing … All eyes turn to making sure the airline is purchased or acquired by another entity sustainable in the future. Malinauskas said he doesn’t typically want to see a situation where governments are subsidising private enterprise, but “this is a unique set of circumstances.” And we should … see what is going on here, and what contributed to the demise of what has been a very profitable and successful airline in the past. Shark nets down earlier in attempt to save more turtles Shark nets in NSW will come down a month earlier this season as authorities try to strike a balance between protecting people as well as marine life, AAP reports. Citing an increase in turtle activity in April, the state government will trial scrapping the nets on 31 March. It will also consult with councils regarding shark management with an eye towards empowering local decision-making on the use of nets. Other trials include inspecting the nets every two days instead of every three, with more drone usage on the days the nets aren’t being inspected to scope for turtles that might have become trapped. Lights will also be used on the nets in February and March to deter turtles, with dolphin pingers and whale alarms to be fitted for the safety of those mammals. The agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, said keeping beachgoers safe was the priority, but striking a balance that protects sea life too was key. Drone surveillance, listening stations for tagged sharks and drumlines will all be used in the state’s $21.5m shark management program. The government said more than 2,000 sharks have been tagged and are monitored by the listening stations. What you missed overnight on day four of the Paris Olympics Need to catch up on the latest from the Olympics? Here’s what you missed overnight, thanks to our sports team! Victorian premier weighs in on allegations of racial discrimination at Collingwood FC The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has arrived at parliament and is being asked about the allegations of racial discrimination at Collingwood football club. She said that speaking generally, all workplaces should be safe from harassment and bullying: Everyone should be safe, secure, free from harassment and bullying … It doesn’t matter whether that workplace is parliament, the Collingwood football club, a construction site, or a supermarket. All workplaces should be safe, secure, and inclusive and what needs to come to create that environment is leadership within all of those workplaces and all of those organisations… In terms of the allegations that have been made currently before the court, they are a matter for the football club. It is in that broader context that I make the point that, particularly when you are leaders in an organisation, there’s a responsibility to consider how you provide that safe and inclusive workplace. What actually happens during an aurora australis? The University of Tasmania’s professor of astrophysics and head of physics, Andrew Cole, explained in this article that outer space is filled with electrically charged particles, and then they hit Earth’s atmosphere they can shine fluorescent lights: This tends to happen in the polar regions, where Earth’s magnetic field is trapping the charge … When electrons encounter the Earth’s magnetic field, they become trapped, moving along the field lines to the poles. The magnetic field funnels the electrons into the atmosphere in the polar regions and they strike atoms of oxygen or nitrogen molecules. In the low-density upper atmosphere, the atoms only lose this energy by emitting light, which creates the glow you see. Green and red come from oxygen at different altitudes, and violet comes from nitrogen. More aurora australis photos taken across Tasmania, Western Australia Here are some more gorgeous photos of the aurora australis overnight, this one taken near the Blundstone Arena in Tasmania: These shots were also captured in Tasmania, with one photo showing a bright blue light: And the aurora australis was also seen in Western Australia, with this social media user capturing some photos and writing, “The stars here in the Southern Hemisphere are spectacular.” Police highlight the 352 unidentified remains across NSW amid Missing Persons Week The missing persons registry currently has 352 unidentified remains located throughout NSW, dating back to 1964. NSW police said that this year alone, they had reports of 85 unidentified remains being located – and after extensive investigations, only two remain unidentified. This week is Missing Persons Week – going from 28 July to 3 August – which aims to raise awareness of the issues and impacts surrounding missing persons. Members of the public are urged to come forward and help police solve some of these mysteries through voluntarily providing their DNA, especially if they have reported a family member missing to police. Det Insp. Ritchie Sim, manager of the registry, said: One unidentified body is too many. This means a family of the missing person and their friends don’t have the answers they’re looking for … It is very common that remains are moved from their initial place of rest due to varying reasons. For example, heavy rain and flooding. These aspects complicate the investigations further, which is why we are always searching for answers … Missing person investigations are not criminal matters, and your DNA is not stored in any criminal or suspect data base. Your DNA will be secured and managed by NSW Health and used to hopefully solve these cases and provide answers to families and loved ones. Located remains linked to man missing for more than five years Remains located on the south coast of NSW earlier this year have been identified as a Victorian man, who was missing for more than five years. In February human remains were discovered in the Beowa national park near Eden, which were seized and sent for forensic examination. Following analysis and a comparison to familial DNA obtained during missing person investigations, the remains were confirmed to be that of a 51-year-old Victorian man, who was reported missing in the Eden area in December 2018. The circumstances surrounding his death were deemed not suspicious and the matter was referred to the coroner, police said. Journalists from the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday are gathering outside Nine Entertainment’s offices across the country after a five-day strike. Some 500 journalists will walk back to the newsroom at 11am but have vowed to continue their campaign of protected industrial action until management offers them what they say is a fair enterprise agreement. The chief executive of Nine, Mike Sneesby, will also be back at work today, having flown in yesterday from Paris where he was hosting advertisers and sponsors. He was criticised for carrying the Olympic torch in the runup to the games. Nine paid $305m for the exclusive rights to the next five games, from Paris in 2024 to Brisbane in 2032. The aurora australis was observed in southern areas of the country overnight, including parts of Tasmania and Melbourne. As noted in yesterday’s blog, the Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting significant geomagnetic activity that could possibly result in visible auroras at night. The geomagnetic storm was expected to be at its strongest during the evening. The MP for Franklin, Julie Collins, shared this photo from her Tasmanian electorate overnight: Here is another photo from Tasmania, with the aurora australis captured at kunanyi/Mount Wellington: Meanwhile, this photo was shared from Cape Schanck in Melbourne: Greens senator urges government to ‘just buy’ Rex Airlines The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, has also weighed in on news of Rex Airlines’ administration. In a post to X, she responded to comments from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, stating he was “concerned” about the regional airline, and called on the government to “just buy it.” Minister says contingencies ready to roll out in case CFMEU tries to contest administration Contingencies will be ready to roll out in case the embattled construction union tries to fight being taken over by administrators, the newly minted workplace relations minister says. As AAP reports, Murray Watt had instructed his department to have legislation ready to table in parliament as soon as it resumed if the CFMEU tried to contest administration, following allegations of being linked to bikies and organised crime. He told ABC RN earlier: The very first briefing that I received in this new role, within hours of being sworn in, focused on the legislation: where it was at, what further decisions needed to be made to finalise it. The CFMEU has appointed former anti-corruption tsar Geoffrey Watson to investigate the allegations. While Watt said he had respect for Watson as “a very eminent lawyer”, the issues within the union’s construction division had gone further than what it could tackle on its own. Senator Watt said he had been briefed repeatedly since being sworn in on Monday and had given the department “further instructions” to ensure the government was ready to respond to any fight. We will support any application that’s made by the general manager of the fair work commission to put some of these branches into administration. If that application is opposed and there’s barriers, if it’s not resolved by the time parliament returns, then we will remove those barriers by government legislation. Veterans more likely to to be hospitalised for suicidal behaviour Veterans are more likely than other Australians to present to hospital for suicidal thoughts or self-harm, a new government study has found. The share of former serving members of the defence force that attended emergency departments for suicidal behaviour from 2013 to 2020 was a third higher than the equivalent across the Australian population, at 3.7% compared to 2.8%. The Australian Institute for Health Welfare’s report, released today, also found a higher proportion of ex-serving females went to hospital for intentional self-harm or suicidal ideation (4.1%) than ex-serving males (3.7%). Ex-serving defence force members were also more likely to be admitted to public hospitals for alcohol and drug use in the year 2019-20. Focusing on men in the same year, the study found those who left the defence force involuntarily or new or junior staff were more likely to be admitted for mental health-related care than ex-servicemen who left by choice or older or more senior members. Admittance for mental health reasons was lower in the air force than in the army or navy. AIHW spokesperson Paul Pham said the report aimed to help the federal government improve mental health support for defence force members and their families. Lifeline: 13 11 14 NSW Police have launched an internal investigation after the video of a shark attack, in which 23-year-old Kai McKenzie lost his leg, was reportedly leaked online. The Daily Telegraph reported that the video appears to be of a computer screen showing the footage inside a police facility, of the moment McKenzie was struck by the shark. McKenzie was surfing off North Shore beach on the mid-north coast of NSW last Tuesday morning when a suspected three-metre great white shark bit him. He was able to fight off the shark before catching a wave into shore, where he was treated with makeshift tourniquets before being airlifted to hospital. His severed leg washed up on shore a short time after the attack and was taken to the hospital, where he underwent surgery and was recovering in a stable condition: In a statement this moring, NSW police said: NSW police are aware of a video circulating online and have commenced an investigation into how the video came to be released. The NSWPF does not tolerate this kind of conduct and will take appropriate action pending the outcome of the investigation. Assistant treasurer to foreshadow second stage of anti-scam measures Stephen Jones will foreshadow a second stage of the government’s anti-scam measures, involving penalties for banks, telcos and digital platforms which don’t introduce preventative checks under new mandatory codes tailored to each sector. For banks, this will include greater controls over bank transfers and an obligation identify and close “mule” accounts. If there is a breach of the code, the bank, telco or digital platform will be held to account. If they drop the ball, they will be liable to compensate the victim. More on Stephen Jones’ upcoming speech to the national press club Government figures show Australians are losing less annually to scammers than they did two years ago – except on social media where the situation is worsening. The current assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones: Scam losses originating on social media were up 17% in 2023. Scam reports were up 31% and the social media companies are dragging their heels. Jones says the first phase of a suite of government anti-scam measures has helped reduce the losses by 13% last year from $3bn in 2022. There was still $2.74bn lost and this is both tragic and excessive. During the pandemic, the cost of scams skyrocketed, with annual losses in Australia doubling in 2021 &amp; again in 2022. Last year’s fall was the first since 2016. Half of all scams still occur via phone or text message and most involve a bank transfer. Jones is vowing to force companies to take more preventative action, labelling it “offensive” that digital platforms allow scammers to use their platforms freely. Digital platforms have a moral obligation to join the fight as part of their social licence. These are trillion-dollar corporations. They can afford to invest in a significant uplift to keep consumers safe. It’s really time for them to get on the side of consumers. The federal government is promising to change the law to force banks to compensate Australian customers who are tricked into transferring money to scammers, accusing them of doing too little to prevent people from being duped out of more than $2bn every year. Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones will tell the National Press Club today that a government crackdown on scammers is having some success but that the corporate bystanders in the scam equation – the platforms that facilitate scammers’ contact and enable their financial transactions – should be doing more to stop them. In a speech that also warns the trend is worsening on social media, Jones says the law does too little to help victims get their money back, because bank customers are being duped into handing over money so the transfers themselves are not unlawful. According to an advance copy of the speech seen by Guardian Australia, Jones will say: A fundamental characteristic of scams is that they are transactions that are authorised – through deception – by the victim, so the law is not fit-for-purpose. We will address this to ensure victims can receive compensation in the right circumstances. Compensation for inaction, for negligence, for failing to meet an obligation is a critical part of our framework. McKenzie says Rex failure would be ‘catastrophic for the regions’ Asked if Rex needs to be bailed out, Bridget McKenzie said if the airline failed it would be “catastrophic for the regions.” They service regional routes that Qantas doesn’t want to … A third of Rex’s business in the regions is around servicing our health needs, either connecting regional residents with specialists in the city or indeed, flying out medical professionals into our communities. They had training facilities for that next generation of pilots, and a huge part of their role is the air freight task. So Rex is a critical component for those of us in the region connecting with the rest of the country, and I don’t want to see – we don’t want to see regional Australians cut off as a result of this government continuing to sit on its hands and not supporting Rex to get through this. Shadow transport minister accuses PM of running ‘protection racket for Qantas’ The shadow minister for transport, Bridget McKenzie, was also on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss the Rex Airlines administration. She was asked about commentary from the prime minister that Rex’s woes coincided with the airline’s push into capital city markets and move away from regional routes, and responded: I think what we heard from the prime minister yesterday was that, once again, [he is] running the protection racket for Qantas, and how dare [anyone] step in and compete on those capital city routes? And remember, when Rex launched into those routes to compete against Qantas, Virgin was grounded, prices were sky high, and service was appalling. They raised private equity of around $150m to enter that market and provided much-needed competition for Qantas. Now you’ve got the prime minister saying, ‘Well, Rex, this is what happens when you go up against the behemoth and my best mate Qantas’… We’ve been talking about this for a long time … [that for] airlines that seek to compete against Qantas, that there is a problem with competition in this country … ‘Higher interest rates would be harder for Australians’, Murray Watt says Murray Watt was also asked about the June quarter inflation figures, set to be announced today. He said most of the market expectations are that inflation is going to remain persistent, “despite the work that the government’s been doing to bring it down”: I’m not going to pre-empt what the Reserve Bank might do, but I think everyone understands that higher interest rates would be harder for Australians. So as a government, what we can do is do everything possible to take that pressure off both the RBA and consumers generally … I think all Australians are nervous today about the inflation figure, and I think that reflects that people are doing it tough at the moment. That’s exactly why Jim Chalmers, in particular, as the treasurer, [finance minister] Katie Gallagher and our whole team are doing everything we can to provide cost of living relief. Murray Watt says advice needed from administrators to determine government support amid administration Murray Watt, the newly-appointed minister for workplace relations, also weighed in on the Rex Airlines administration on ABC RN just earlier. He said all the options for a pathway forward would be considered “once the situation becomes clear and we get some advice from the administrators.” In terms of equity stakes or other financial government support, we’ll make those decisions once the situation becomes clearer through the administrator. Watt said that within his department, there’s a number of roles it could play to support workers – including a financial entitlements guarantee scheme. This would only be activated if the company is unable to repay entitlements to any workers who are retrenched, and let’s hope it may not get to that. But also, our department would be providing employment support to workers who do lose their job to ensure that they can get back into work as quickly as possible. I was actually briefed by my department about this earlier this morning, and I’ve been in contact with [transport minister] Catherine King to make sure that we’re working together on this as well. The government is really dedicated towards hoping to make sure that this airline has a future, but also to ensure the workers are protected. Transport Workers Union says measures to protect jobs amid Rex administration ‘urgently needed’ Following Rex Airlines entering voluntary administration, the Transport Workers Union says measures to protect jobs and secure entitlements in the event of any job losses is “urgently needed”. The long-term solution to issues affecting the industry is a stand-alone regulator, the union argued, also calling for a “safe and secure skies” commission into the industry. The union’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the news comes just four weeks after Bonza went into liquidation: It is absolutely critical that as many jobs as possible are protected through the continuation of regional flights, while entitlements are secured for those unable to retain employment … Aviation is locked in a cycle of crises. While the Rex administration is handled as quickly as possible, we also need a long-term fix to the unregulated market dominance that sees Qantas popping the champagne corks while competitors are squeezed out and workers are left on the scrap heap. Given the size of Australia, the question at the heart of this crisis is: what support do we need to make sure there’s a viable aviation industry that can serve the community reliably and affordably? A Safe and secure skies commission to bring balance and binding standards is the answer to that question. Treasurer says inflation was ‘sticky and stubborn’ last month ahead of latest figures Moving to the June quarter inflation figures – set to be announced today – the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said most people are expecting inflation to have been “sticky and stubborn” last month and “more persistent than anyone would like”: But we need to remember that inflation has come down really considerably since we were elected. When we were elected it had a six in front of them. We’ll see what the numbers say later on this morning. Asked if he would expect another rate rise, Chalmers said he would not pre-empt a decision of the RBA: They’ll weigh up a whole range of factors in our economy, not just today’s inflation numbers, but also the conditions in the economy more broadly… If the inflation figure today is a bit persistent – a bit sticky and stubborn, more so than we would like – that would be an unwelcome outcome, but also unsurprising, given the pressures coming to us from the world, and some domestic factors like fruit and vegetables and travel costs. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning to talk about the Rex Airlines administration. He said it was a “relief” for communities that regional services would continue: We want to see those regional services continue. Minister Catherine King is also talking with the other airlines to make sure if there’s job losses, that the other airlines can re-employ and re-deploy some of the workers as well. Asked if taxpayer support would be needed to keep the regional routes operating, Chalmers said “there’s been discussions but I don’t want to pre-empt the company statement”: We want to hear next from the company. They’ve indicated they will be making a statement before long. Sydney Airport CEO calls for more competition in aviation industry amid Rex administration Sydney Airport CEO Scott Charlton also responded to the Rex Airlines administration, sending thoughts to Rex passengers and employees impacted by the administration: We are pleased to see that the administrator will continue regional operations to and from Sydney during this period as these services are critical for many regional communities. What this situation demonstrates is that we need to change some things in the Australian aviation market for competition to thrive, because recent history suggests the barriers are too high. We have a rare opportunity to get this right with the proposed slot reforms at Sydney airport and through the imminent aviation white paper, and we remain ready to work with the government on implementing both. Melbourne airport responds to Rex Airlines administration news Sticking with Rex Airlines for a moment: Melbourne Airport said in a statement this morning it is “deeply disappointed” by the suspension of Rex services and stands ready to assist passengers. Rex services from Melbourne to Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart, the Gold Coast and Perth have been cancelled. Affected passengers will be reaccommodated on Virgin Australia flights free of charge … Melbourne Airport was proudly home to Rex’s largest 737 jet base and our thoughts are with the staff affected by this announcement. The team at Melbourne airport will continue to work hard to facilitate new entrants to the Australian market because of the benefits they bring to consumers. The transport minister, Catherine King, spoke with ABC AM earlier this morning about the future of Rex Airlines following news last night that flights between capital cities were grounded and it has entered voluntary administration. King said that it was “in everyone’s interests that this airline continue, and we’re determined to do what we can.” We understand how important Rex is, particularly to the regions – there are some areas where this is the only, only option in terms of transport … We also can’t do it just at any cost, so we’ll be talking to the administrators, we’ve been talking to Rex – my department – all of yesterday. We know that there will be some seeking of support from government and we will take some time to work our way through that with the administrators, we want to do that properly. The minister said Rex hadn’t “asked for specifics as yet”, but were after assistance to ensure operations can continue into the airport and to ensure they could still access fuel supply: I think it is fair to say that we would be reluctant to just throw money at the problem … What we would want to do is ensure that there is a long-term solution to the security of regional aviation and we will take time to work our way through that. The federal government is expected to formally respond today to the findings of the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability, nine months after they were made public. The commission’s final report, released last September, came after four and a half years of hearings, publications, submissions and powerful testimony from people with disability and their loved ones. The commission found that people with disability “continue to experience high rates of violence and abuse, multiple forms of neglect, and sexual and financial exploitation” and significant change was required for Australia to be a truly inclusive society. There were 222 recommendations in the 12-volume final report, including that the federal government commit to the enactment of a disability rights act that embodies the principles set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Other recommendations included prohibitions on non-therapeutic, involuntary sterilisation of people with disability, immediate action at all levels of government to prevent the use of restrictive practices, and the “significant reform” and “transformational change” of mainstream housing, education and employment systems to remove ableist barriers and minimise or eliminate segregation. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said at the time that the government would take “a considered and staged approach” to responding to the findings. You can read more about what the commission recommended here: A woman has been bitten by a shark on an island off the coast of Western Australia, about 80km west of Geraldton. According to Sharksmart, she was snorkelling at Rat Island, in the Abrolhos Islands, when she was bitten by an unknown species of shark. The ABC reported the woman in her 30s was flown to Geraldton and taken to the local hospital for treatment. The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development is working with local authorities to coordinate a response. It has urged people to take additional caution in the Rat Island area, adhere to any beach closures and report shark sightings to water police. Good morning, and happy Wednesday. Welcome back to a new day on the Australia news live blog – I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of today. A woman has been bitten by a shark on an island off the coast of Western Australia, about 80km west of Geraldton. She was snorkelling at Rat Island, in the Abrolhos Islands, when she was bitten by an unknown species of shark yesterday afternoon. Meanwhile, the federal government is expected to formally respond today to the findings of the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability – nine months after they were made public. As Stephanie Convery reports, the commission found people with disability “continue to experience high rates of violence and abuse, multiple forms of neglect, and sexual and financial exploitation” and significant change was required for Australia to be a truly inclusive society. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said at the time that the government would take “a considered and staged approach” to responding to the findings.

                    "bodyText": "In ancient Greece, Aristotle was big on “noble leisure”, but modern Greece might need a refresher, having just introduced a six-day, 48-hour working week. Opponents have described the measure as “barbaric”, an erosion of workers’ rights in a country that already works the longest hours in Europe. I have been thinking a lot about work recently. OK, I am not exactly formulating an incisive critique of the labour market (most of my thoughts are of dinner or pigeons), but I have been wondering why we still do so much of it. I studied economics for a brief, inglorious time 30 years ago – with about as much understanding as a pigeon, actually – but the one bit that stuck was John Maynard Keynes’s assertion that, in future, we would work 15-hour weeks. In 1930, in Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, he argued (not entirely seriously; it was originally an after-dinner speech) that income from capital and technological progress would, within two generations, make work optional. Most people would do a bit (“Three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!” he said) because old habits die hard, but the “permanent problem”, he claimed, would be “how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won”. I don’t know about you, but what to do with my excess leisure time has not yet become a permanent problem; it is not a problem anyone in the Greek private sector will be complaining about, either. The global workforce is overstretched, frayed to breaking point and existentially exhausted. From fulfilment centre workers and drivers apparently peeing in bottles because they can’t take breaks to burnt-out white-collar workers realising that, for all its benefits, technologically enabled “flexible working” eats inexorably into our previously private time, people are working longer and losing quality of life. Keynes wrote Economic Possibilities in the depths of the Great Depression; in 2024, it still feels properly audacious. A three-hour day is an idea even #softlife TikTok girlies wouldn’t dare to dream of: enough time with people you love and to fulfil your caring responsibilities; time for self-care, with proper food and exercise; time to engage in your community and to pursue diverse, intellectually satisfying interests? It’s the kind of decadent socialist wonderland that hardline Republicans in the US imagine Europe to be (they would expect no less of someone from the pansexual polycule that was Bloomsbury, I suppose). So why aren’t we getting what Keynes promised? We are starting to look more critically at whether long working hours serve us. Critiques of hustle culture become ever more pointed. When the UK’s four-day-week trials concluded last year, 56 out of 61 companies chose to continue with the model; a second pilot is planned for November. Several European countries have legislated to protect employees’ out-of-work hours and Labour’s New Deal for Working People included a right to switch off that will hopefully become law. These are unambitious baby steps, though. OK, Keynes underestimated the increase in post-work life expectancy; how the invention of better stuff would push us to desire and strive for it; and how much the distribution of wealth matters. But we live in a time of technological and AI-enabled wonderment that even Keynes could not have imagined. It is also a time of overconfident billionaire “disruptors”, beneficiaries of that unfair distribution of wealth. If one of them chose this as their goal, rather than firing penis-shaped craft in all directions, surely they could achieve it. I wonder if something else is going on. We are not there mentally – just look at the flak Keir Starmer took for daring to suggest he might sometimes stop work at six on Fridays. Is it possible that we are scared? What if it turns out we have no intellectual hinterland, that we are impatient carers and rubbish at playing with our kids? What if we don’t want to make healthy food and do weight-bearing exercise and daily cardio – and no longer have an excuse not to? What if our leisure doesn’t turn out to be “noble” and we just spend longer staring at our phones? We won’t know until we try. There are only six years before Economic Possibilities turns 100; come on, let’s make this happen. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist"

                    "bodyText": "I bought an iPhone 15 the other day to replace my five-year-old iPhone 11. The phone is powered by the new A17 Pro chip and has a terabyte of data storage and accordingly was eye-wateringly expensive. I had, of course, finely honed rationales for splashing out on such a scale. I’ve always had a policy of writing only about kit that I buy with my own money (no freebies from tech companies), for example. The fancy A17 processor is needed to run the new “AI” stuff that Apple is promising to launch soon; the phone has a significantly better camera than my old handset had – which matters (to me) because my Substack blog goes out three times a week and I provide a new photograph for each edition; and, finally, a friend whose ancient iPhone is on its last legs might appreciate an iPhone 11 in good nick. But these are rationalisations rather than solid justifications. The truth is that my old iPhone was fine for the job. Sure, it would need a new battery in time, but apart from that it had years more life in it. And if you take a cold, detached look at the evolution of the iPhone product line, what you see from the 2010 iPhone 4 onwards is really just a sequence of steady incremental improvements. What was so special about that model? Mostly this: it had a front-facing camera, which opened up the world of selfies, video chat, social media and all the other accoutrements of our networked world. But from then on, it was just incremental changes and price rises all the way. And this is true not just for iPhones but for smartphones, generally. Samsung, Huawei, Google and other manufacturers have been on the same path. The arrival of the smartphone signalled by the launch of the first iPhone in 2007 represented a sharp discontinuity in the evolution of mobile phone technology. (If in doubt just ask Nokia or BlackBerry.) There then followed a massive surge for a decade or so, until the technology (and the market) matured and incremental changes became the rule. Mathematicians have a name for this process. They call it a Sigmoid function and draw it as an S-shaped curve. When you apply it to consumer electronic devices, the curve looks like an “S” that’s been flattened a bit. Progress is slow at the bottom; then it takes a sharp upward turn, before eventually flattening out at the top. And smartphones are now on that part of the curve. If we look back at the history of the tech industry over the last five decades or so, we can discern a pattern. First there’s a technical breakthrough: the silicon chip; the internet; the web; the mobile phone; cloud computing; the smartphone. Each breakthrough is followed by a period of frantic development (often accompanied by investment bubbles), which propels the technology up the middle bit of the “S”; and then eventually things calm down as markets become saturated and radical improvements in the tech become more and more difficult to achieve. You can perhaps see where this is heading: to so-called “AI”. It’s already had its initial breakthroughs: first, the arrival of “big data” produced by the web, social media and surveillance capitalism; then the rediscovery of powerful algorithms (neural networks), followed by the invention of the “transformer” deep-learning architecture in 2017; and then the development of large language models (LLMs) and other forms of generative AI of which ChatGPT was the poster-child. We’ve now had a period of frenzied development and insane amounts of corporate investment (with no clear idea of what the returns on that investment will be), which has propelled the technology up the central part of the sigmoid curve. So interesting questions now arise: how far up the sigmoid curve has the industry climbed thus far? And when will it reach the plateau, where smartphone technology currently reclines? In recent weeks we’ve begun to see signs that that moment may be approaching. The technology is being commoditised. The AI companies have started to release smaller and (allegedly) cheaper LLMs. They won’t admit this, of course, but that may have something to do with the way the energy costs of the technology are ballooning. The industry’s irrational boosterism cuts little ice with economists. And while millions of people have tried ChatGPT and its peers, most of them haven’t displayed enduring interest. Virtually every large company on the planet has had an AI “pilot” project or two, but few of them seem to have made it into actual deployment. So could it be that this sensation du jour is about to get boring? A bit like the latest shiny smartphone, in fact.

                    "bodyText": "The two-month public comment period for the US Drug Enforcement Administration’s proposed rules to reschedule cannabis closed this week and the agency will now review the submissions – taking into account the American public’s views on cannabis for the first time ever. Nearly 43,000 citizens, organizations and researchers submitted comments – the most the DEA has ever received over a proposed rule change. The volume of responses showed how motivated Americans are to speak on this issue, said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation at the Drug Policy Alliance. “This is an unprecedented opportunity that folks have had to participate in public comment on the topic of federal marijuana scheduling or the legal status of marijuana at the federal level,” she said. Commenters used the opportunity not only to share views on the policy in question, but to share their beliefs and experiences about cannabis and legalization in general. Some shared fears that rescheduling cannabis could be harmful to children, or that it is a “gateway drug”. Many commenters described positive experiences with cannabis, including as a way to treat seizures, anxiety and autism symptoms. Preliminary analyses show most commenters felt rescheduling was not enough and wanted more significant steps toward federal legalization. The DEA’s proposed rules would reclassify cannabis from a schedule I to a schedule III substance, meaning that cannabis’s status will change from an illegal narcotic on the federal level to a medication that is eligible for FDA approval, but still federally illegal in most circumstances. Still, Packer said rescheduling “doesn’t address the conflict between federal laws and state laws. And, significantly for the communities that we serve, rescheduling marijuana does nothing to acknowledge or address the racist origins of marijuana criminalization, or its resulting racial disparities.” Most of the comments reflect Packer’s view. She noted that the Drug Policy Alliance used keyword searches to rapidly analyze the 43,000 comments and determine how many favored more significant steps toward legalization. They searched for keywords and phrases like “decriminalize”, “treated like alcohol” and “full legalization”. The result was that 69% of commenters wanted cannabis to be decriminalized or completely descheduled, meaning it would share its legal status with alcohol and cigarettes. Headset, a cannabis data platform, also conducted a rapid analysis of the comments using the latest version of Open AI’s large language model, according to its CEO, Cy Scott. The AI would summarize each comment and then determine its position. The analysis yielded similar results: 57% of commenters supported descheduling cannabis, while 35% supported rescheduling and 8% wanted it to remain an illegal schedule I substance. These numbers roughly align with Pew research showing that 57% of Americans think cannabis should be legal for medical and recreational purposes, while 32% think it should be legal for medical use only. Scott said the AI analysis provided other insights. For example, comments from those opposed to medical cannabis tended to come in large spikes of form letters, while comments from those who supported different types of cannabis legalization seemed to flow in more organically. Packer said that commenters might be responding, in part, to Biden’s past statements on cannabis legalization. During his 2020 campaign, he promised to “decriminalize marijuana”. “Despite the fact that President Biden has repeatedly said that no one should be in jail for marijuana [possession], this rescheduling decision does nothing to end marijuana arrests or prevent folks from actually going to jail for marijuana,” she said. What happens next is unclear, partly because the DEA is in uncharted territory with this process. “In a perfect world, they’d say, since they have 60% of respondents who want marijuana to be legal, it’s legal for most people under state law already, let’s just deschedule it. But I recognize the reality that that’s not very likely,” said Aaron Smith, cofounder and CEO of the National Cannabis Industry Association. Smith still saw rescheduling as a sign of progress, and was hopeful that it would go through by the end of the year. Packer was less optimistic, saying: “There are lots of different ways to think that this process can be slowly delayed and not happen before the election and also could potentially not happen before the end of President Biden’s term.” The DEA could decide to hold a public hearing on rescheduling, which would slow down the process, or there could be legal challenges to rescheduling. And even if rescheduling does go through, Packer said the federal criminalization of cannabis would continue to have a negative impact. “This means that for the next decade or plus – because who knows how long we’ll be dealing with this policy – medical patients, adult consumers, state medical marijuana programs, the adult-use programs, the businesses that participate in these programs, the employees that are employed by those businesses, all of these folks are still in illegal activity, subject to collateral consequences and really burdened by federal criminalization,” Packer added. Smith wondered how the DEA would process how few commenters actually supported rescheduling – if the agency actually does go through with rescheduling. “In a way it’s not great because when you look at the total, 35% wanted it to be schedule III,” she pointed out. “So if you look at this and determine it’s going to be schedule III, only a third of people who took the time to comment are really going to be happy.” • This article was amended on 29 July 2024. The percentage of commenters to the DEA consultation who were in favour of cannabis legalization or decriminalization was 69%, not 59% as an earlier version said"

                    "bodyText": "Last year, Rachel Antell, an archival producer for documentary films, started noticing AI-generated images mixed in with authentic photos. There are always holes or limitations in an archive; in one case, film-makers got around a shortage of images for a barely photographed 19th-century woman by using AI to generate what looked like old photos. Which brought up the question: should they? And if they did, what sort of transparency is required? The capability and availability of generative AI – the type that can produce text, images and video – have changed so rapidly, and the conversations around it have been so fraught, that film-makers’ ability to use it far outpaces any consensus on how. “We realized it was kind of the wild west, and film-makers without any mal-intent were getting themselves into situations where they could be misleading to an audience,” said Antell. “And we thought, what’s needed here is some real guidance.” So Antell and several colleagues formed the Archival Producers Alliance (APA), a volunteer group of about 300 documentary producers and researchers dedicated to, in part, developing best practices for use of generative AI in factual storytelling. “Instead of being, ‘the house is burning, we’ll never have jobs,’ it’s much more based around an affirmation of why we got into this in the first place,” said Stephanie Jenkins, a founding APA member. Experienced documentary film-makers have “really been wrestling with this”, in part because “there is so much out there about AI that is so confusing and so devastating or, alternatively, a lot of snake oil.” The group, which published an open letter warning against “forever muddying the historical record” through generative AI and released a draft set of guidelines this spring, is one of the more organized efforts in Hollywood to grapple with the ethics of a technology that, for all the bullish or doomsday prophesying, is already here and shaping the industry. Short of regulation or relevant union agreements, it has come down to film-makers – directors, producers, writers, visual effects and VFX artists and more – to figure out how to use it, where to draw the line and how to adapt. “It’s a project by project basis” for “use cases and the ethical implications of AI”, said Jim Geduldick, a VFX supervisor and cinematographer who has worked on Masters of the Air, Disney’s live-action Pinocchio and the upcoming Robert Zemeckis film Here, which uses AI to de-age its stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. “Everybody’s using it. Everybody’s playing with it.” Some of the industry’s adoption of AI has been quiet – for years, studios and tech companies with entertainment arms have already engaged in a tacit machine learning arms race. Others have embraced the technology enthusiastically and optimistically; Runway, an AI research company, hosted its second annual AI Film Festival in New York and Los Angeles this spring, with presenting partners in the Television Academy and the Tribeca Festival. The latter featured five short films made by OpenAI’s Sora, the text-to-video model yet to be released to the public that prompted the film mogul Tyler Perry to halt an $800m expansion of his studios in Atlanta because “jobs are going to be lost”. The industry’s embrace has engendered plenty of pushback. Last month, in response to Tribeca and other nascent AI film festivals, the director of Violet, Justine Bateman, announced a “raw and real”, no-AI-allowed film festival for spring 2025, which “creates a tunnel for human artists through the theft-based, job-replacing AI destruction”. And in the year since the dual actors and writers’ strikes secured landmark protections against the use of generative AI to replace jobs or steal likenesses, numerous non-protected instances of AI have drawn attention and scorn online. Concerns about job and quality loss surrounded AI-generated images in A24 promotional posters for the film Civil War, interstitials in the horror film Late Night with the Devil and a fake band poster in True Detective: Night Country. The alleged use of AI-generated archival photos in the Netflix documentary What Jennifer Did reignited discussions about documentary ethics first sparked by similar outcry over three lines of AI-generated narration to mimic Anthony Bourdain in the 2021 film Roadrunner. And that’s not to mention all of the bemoaning of disposable AI filler content – or “slop”, as the parlance goes – clogging up our social media feeds. Taken together, the burgeoning use of generative AI in media can feel overwhelming – before the ink is dry on any new proclamation about it, the ground has shifted again. On an individual level, film artists are figuring out whether to embrace the technology now, how to use it and where their craft is headed. It has already rendered dubbing and translation work nearly obsolete. Visual effects artists, perennially on the bleeding edge of new technology for Hollywood, are already working with machine learning and some generative AI, particularly for pre-production visualizations and workflows. “From an artist’s perspective, we’re all trying to get ahead of the game and play with open source tools that are available,” said Kathryn Brillhart, a cinematographer and director whose credits include The Mandalorian, Black Adam and Fallout. Both Geduldick and Brillhart noted numerous limitations on the use of generative AI in film projects at this point – for one, the security of these platforms, especially for big studios worried about leaks or hacks. There’s the legal liability and ethics of the current generative AI models, which to date have trained on scraped data. “Some studios are like, ‘We don’t even feel comfortable using gen AI in storyboards and concept art, because we don’t want a hint of any theft or licensing issues to come through in the final,’” said Brillhart. Studio films that do employ AI have limited uses and a clear data trail – in the case of Zemeckis’s Here, the new de-aging and face replacement tech, designed by the AI firm Metaphysic and the Hollywood agency CAA, uses the faces of Hanks and Wright, famous actors who have signed on to the roles, to play characters over the course of 50 years. “I’ve always been attracted to technology that helps me to tell a story,” Zemeckis said in 2023 of his decision to use Metaphysic. “With Here, the film simply wouldn’t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic’s AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible!” And then there’s the output of generative AI, which often plunges deep into the uncanny valley and leaves much to be desired. (Or, in the words of the AI skeptic David Fincher, “it always looks like sort of a low-rent version of Roger Deakins”). Geduldick, who has integrated AI into his workflow, sees current generative AI models as more “assistive” than truly imitative of human art. “Are they implementing generative models that are going to speed up both the business and the creative side of what we’re doing? Yes,” he said. “But I think that there is no generative model out there today that doesn’t get touched by artistic hands to get it to the next level. That is for the foreseeable future.” Still, like the digital revolution before it, the one certainty about generative AI is that it will change the field of visual effects – making pre-visualization cheaper and more efficient, streamlining tedious processes, shaping storyboard design. As the work shifts, “I think everybody needs to pivot,” said Geduldick. “The craft has gone from hand-making models to using a mouse to now using text and using your brain in different ways,” said Brillhart. “What’s going to happen is more of a forced learning curve,” she added. “I think there’s going to be growing pains, for sure.” On the documentary side, generative AI opens new opportunities for nonfiction storytelling, though also threatens trust. “All technology has a kind of a dual moral purpose. And it’s up to us to interrogate the technology to find the way to use it for good,” said David France, an investigative journalist and film-maker whose 2020 documentary Welcome to Chechnya is one of a handful in recent years to employ generative AI as an anonymization device. The film, which follows the state-sanctioned persecution of LGBTQ+ people in the Russian republic, used AI to map actors’ faces over real subjects who faced harrowing violence. France and his team tried several different methods to get around risking exposure; nothing worked cinematically, until trying the equivalent of deepfake technology, though with multi-step processes of consent and clear limitations. “We realized that we had an opportunity to really empower the people whose stories we were telling, to tell their stories directly to the audience and be faithful in their kind of emotional presentation,” said France. The film-makers Reuben Hamlyn and Sophie Compton employed a similar technique for the subjects of their film Another Body, who were the victims of nonconsensual, deepfake pornography. Their main subject, “Taylor”, communicates through a digital veil – like deepfakes, an AI-generated face that interprets her real expressions through different features. Along with demonstrating the convincing, uncanny power of the technology that someone used to target Taylor, the AI translated “every minute facial gesture”, said Hamlyn. “That emotional truth is retained in a way that is impossible even with silhouetting.” “It’s such an important tool in empowering people to share their story,” he added. Crucially, both Welcome to Chechnya and Another Body clue their audiences to the technology through implicit or explicit tells. That’s in line with the best practices put forth by the Archival Producers Alliance, to avoid what has landed other films in hot water – namely Roadrunner, whose use of AI was revealed in the New Yorker after the film’s release. The group also encourages documentary film-makers to rely on primary sources whenever possible; to think through algorithmic biases produced by the model’s training data; to be as intentional with generative AI as they would with re-enactments; and consider how synthetic material, released in the world, could cloud the historical record. “We never say don’t do it,” said Jenkins, the APA member, but instead “think about what you’re saying when you use this new material and how it will come across to your audience. There is something really special about the human voice and the human face, and you want to engage with [generative AI] in a way that is intentional and doesn’t fall into some sort of manipulation.” That line between human and machine is perhaps the most fraught one in Hollywood at the moment, in flux and uncertain. Compton, the co-director of Another Body, sees the emotionally loaded debates around AI as a series of smaller, more manageable questions involving pre-existing industry issues. “There are genuinely existential aspects of this discussion, but in terms of film and AI, we’re not really talking about those things,” she said. “We’re not talking about killer robots. What we are talking about is consent, and what is the dataset that’s being used, and whose jobs are on the line if this is adopted massively.” Geduldick, an optimist on the assistive uses of generative AI, nevertheless sees a gap between its day-to-day applications, tech companies’ lofty rhetoric, and “soulless” AI content produced for content’s sake. Companies such as OpenAI – whose chief technology officer recently said generative AI might eliminate some creative jobs, “but maybe they shouldn’t have been there in the first place” – have “repeatedly shown in their public-facing interviews or marketing that there’s a disconnect [in] understanding what creatives actually do,” he said. “Film-making is a collaborative thing. You are hiring loads of talented artists, technicians, craftspeople to come together and create this vision that the writers, director, showrunners and producers have thought up.” For now, according to Geduldick, the “hype outweighs the practical applications” of generative AI, but that does not obviate the need for regulation from the top, or for guidelines for those already using it. “The potential for it to be cinematic is really great,” said France. “I don’t know yet that we’ve seen anybody solve the ethical problem of how to use it.” In the meantime, film-making, both feature and nonfiction, is at a fluid, amorphous crossroads. Generative AI is here – part potential, part application, part daunting, part exciting and, to many, a tool. There will likely be more AI film festivals, more backlash, more and more AI content creation – for better or for worse. There are already whole AI-generated streaming services, should you choose to generate your own content. How the human element will fare remains an open question – according to a recent Deloitte study, a surprising 22% of Americans thought generative AI could write more interesting TV shows or movies than people. The only certainty, at this point, is that AI will be used, and the industry will change as a result. “This will be in films that are coming out,” said Jenkins. “So hold on to your seats.”"

                    "bodyText": "The pub is empty when we arrive. “Can you fit us in?” Jess Phillips asks the barman, followed by the familiar smirk. She can’t help herself. Phillips has never been your regular MP. She’s a warm, wise-cracking, potty-mouthed, deeply serious showoff. She’s political Marmite. Lots of people love her, while a fair few hate her with a passion. At least half a dozen men have been convicted of abuse, death and rape threats. She orders half a lager, then mocks herself for being such a wuss. “Half a lager!” she parrots, as if she can’t quite believe that it’s come to this. But Phillips is exhausted. It’s six days since the most remarkable British general election in decades, with Labour transforming the 2019 trouncing into a landslide victory. On a night of memorable moments (the unseating of Liz Truss, Jeremy Corbyn winning as an independent, Nigel Farage becoming an MP at his eighth attempt, and on it goes), the most memorable might well belong to Phillips – and not in a good way. She had started the day with a majority of 10,659 and only just held on to her Birmingham Yardley seat by 693 votes, with George Galloway’s Workers party of Great Britain, standing on a pro-Palestine platform, finishing a close second. When she began her victory speech, she was heckled by Workers party supporters. She looked both distraught and furious. In the end it was the fury that won out with an astonishingly pugnacious speech. She asked officials to remove the hecklers, called it “the worst election I have ever stood in”, reporting that a Labour activist was filmed on the street and had her tyres slashed, while a young woman on her own delivering leaflets was filmed and screamed at by a much older man. Phillips said the family of Jo Cox, the former MP murdered by a far-right extremist in the runup to the Brexit referendum, had been due to campaign with her that day, but she wouldn’t allow them to see the “aggression and violence in our democracy”. Phillips, 42, grew into her anger as the boos continued. “I will continue with my speech. I understand that a strong woman standing up to you is met with such reticence,” she said. She triumphed over the toxicity, but it made for uncomfortable and upsetting viewing. Her speech was then weaponised by campaigners on the right who suggested Phillips had been solely addressing Muslim men. Three days after the election, she told LBC: “The fact that they were Muslim is not significant, because the Muslim men in my constituency did not behave like this. They did it because they were idiots, not because they were Muslims.” The count represented all that is ugly in contemporary British politics – and how much work the Labour government has to do to restore civility and trust. “The right will always try to find some rhetoric to hang their hat on,” she says today. “Loads of Muslim people have been writing to me from my constituency saying they had to tell me they thought what happened was abhorrent. And I’m like: it’s not your responsibility.” Was she more worried about losing her job as an MP, or losing to the Workers party? The latter, she says. “Losing to opponents is the game we play, but I didn’t want to lose to them because they’d been so vile. The thing that frightens me about losing is they would have used it as a scalp of feminism. It’s the takedown of your ideals that I find difficult more than losing. I’d get another job, wouldn’t I?” As well as being an MP, Phillips is a regular guest on satirical TV shows such as Have I Got News for You and The Last Leg, has starred in the weekly podcast Electoral Dysfunction alongside political journalist Beth Rigby and former Scottish Conservative party leader Ruth Davidson, and is about to publish her fourth book. Let’s Be Honest is a plea and manifesto for decent politics. A recent report revealed that Phillips was the second-highest earner outside parliament among Labour MPs. You are highly employable, I say. “Yeaaaah!” she says, like a cat lapping the milk. “I’d say so, but luckily it doesn’t matter now, does it?” The irony is that Phillips resigned from her shadow minister role last November in protest at her party’s failure to support a ceasefire in Gaza. She tells me it was a mix of principle and self-interest – she wanted to make a stance and knew that if she didn’t she would almost certainly lose her seat in the general election anyway. She is still devastated by the campaign. “The idea that people could shout at me saying I was harming the children of Gaza when I was literally helping children get out of Gaza … ” She trails off. Does she think Keir Starmer’s initial response to Gaza, when he said Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water from Gaza, almost cost her her seat? “Yep. Yeah, no doubt about it. The original response was bad.” She insists he was so determined to stick to the line that Israel had a right to defend itself that he went too far. “It was a mistake. He did clarify later, but it was too late.” Phillips admits she thought she had blown her chance of a ministerial role in the new government. When her 15-year-old son, Danny, asked if she thought she would be given a cabinet job, she replied that seeing as she was sat next to him in her pyjamas as the chosen few were walking into No 10, it seemed unlikely. A couple of days later, she got the call from Labour’s chief of staff, Sue Gray: would she join the Home Office as an undersecretary with her old responsibilities for domestic abuse and safeguarding. Would she ever! To say she is thrilled is putting it mildly. In Let’s Be Honest she talks about holding this post in the shadow cabinet. “Had I held this job in government, it would have been the realisation of my life’s work,” she writes. When I remind her, she smiles. “Yeah, that’s how I feel. It’s overwhelming. Overwhelming. Actually, the realisation of my life’s work will be once I’ve done it for five years and made some difference. But, yes, it’s the first day of the realisation of my life’s work.” As she finishes the sentence, her phone beeps with a text message. She looks at it and goes pale, and continues staring at the phone. Eventually she turns back to me, and reads it out. “The three women killed in the crossbow attack were the wife and two daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt. So his wife and two daughters have been murdered. Beggars belief, doesn’t it? Well, it doesn’t beggar belief. My husband sometimes says to me, ‘Your ability to be shocked by these things is a phenomenon to me, Jess.’ People say you have to have a thick skin in politics. Well, actually, I don’t want to have a thick skin. I want it to be pierced by these things.” She looks floored. What’s your first reaction when you hear about something like this? “You feel horrified for the loss and you feel tired. And you immediately go to what happened preceding it that could have stopped it. There may be none, so I wouldn’t speculate in this case. But in 50% of femicide cases there have been at least 10 opportunities presented to stop it.” Your skin is thick in some ways, I say. “Oh, I’m nails, don’t get me wrong.” Phillips has a distinctive way of talking – thick Brummie accent, and when she wants to emphasise a point, her pitch rises and she elongates the final word. You’re like a kid in the schoolyard, I say. She nods. “I am like a schoolkid. I was thinking, with all the new MPs I’d be like a year 11 girl with big hoop earrings and a short skirt.” She takes a rare pause. “I’m actually being very nice to them all, even though I don’t know who they all are and which are Tory and which are Labour. They all just look like very lovely, clean people.” Were you a fighter at school? “Not at school. But I have three older brothers and used to have physical fights with them at home. I was raised to believe I was tougher than them. I’m tough in most situations and I’m not afraid to speak back at people if they’re having a pop at me. That’s what I mean by being nails. But I’d be dreadful in a physical fight now. I’ve got very weak arms. I wouldn’t know how to punch somebody.” Phillips is the youngest of four siblings. She was brought up as a socialist in a formidable line of socialists. Her father, a retired English teacher who went on to be a teacher trainer, has always been more of a firebrand than her mother. “Though he would never appreciate being referred to as a Trot. He’s not a Trot or a Tankie. He’s a very pure socialist.” Her mother, who died 13 years ago, was an NHS administrator who rose to become deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation and chair of South Birmingham mental health trust. Her maternal grandfather was a commercial cartoonist who also drew for the newspaper of the leftwing Labour group Campaign and was friends with Tony Benn, whom she cites as her hero. Her maternal great-grandfather was a founder of the Independent Labour party in Birmingham. For her 14th birthday, her parents bought her party membership. “It wasn’t an option. If you were a member of our house, you were a member of the Labour party when you turned 14.” She looks at me, lest I’ve misunderstood. “I did get other birthday presents as well!” And yet for many on the left she is a bete noire. Why? “I suppose the Jeremy Corbyn thing.” She was vocal in her criticism of Corbyn and said she would find it “incredibly difficult” to continue as a Labour MP if he remained leader. “I hate that people on the left think I’m not leftwing because I didn’t like their man. Who gets to define leftwingness? I am pragmatic, but I’m leftwing. My mum used to say, ‘The only trouble with socialists is that they have bad connotations for me of shouty men looking after each other.’” And she says, that’s what Labour felt like to her in the Corbyn years. “Anything offered with a false prophet gets a bit shouty. Anything where you’re certain that you are right without exception, your certainty stinks. Always open yourself up for nuance.” Did she fall out with her dad over Corbyn? “No. My dad is a kind socialist, not an angry one, and they were attacking me, and he was like: ‘Hold on, she might be more rightwing than you lot but she’s mine.’ I think me and my father are about to start disagreeing! I can sense the ‘I’m not sure this is the Labour party I joined’ in the air already. My dad is not keen on a slick Labour party.” According to research published earlier this month, Phillips’ constituency is one of the top five in the country adversely affected by the two-child benefit cap, which has been shown to have a strong correlation to child poverty. Does she want to get rid of the cap? “Yes, of course I want to get rid of it. And so does Keir Starmer – the idea that anyone in the Labour party wouldn’t want to get rid of it … nobody wants it ideologically!” So Labour will get rid of it? “I think we probably will at such a time as it’s affordable.” On Tuesday, a couple of weeks after we last met, Labour suspended seven “leftwing” MPs, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, for supporting an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit. It’s a controversial move – critics described it as autocratic - and pointless, because the amendment failed by 260 votes anyway. “I’m good friends with some of these people, but I think Keir did the right thing, if I’m honest,” Phillips tells me on the phone. “When I was first elected to parliament, just after Ed Miliband stood down, it felt like anybody could do whatever they liked on anything. And that is the politics I’ve lived with for the last decade. We’ve got all these new MPs who’ve started and this was one of the first votes and I think Keir had to show leadership. If you’re going to deliver a government programme, you have to show strength. Also it felt like a game was being played rather than changing anything to do with child poverty.” Her tensions with Labour’s left go back to her earliest days in parliament. Ed Miliband had resigned as Labour leader after losing the 2015 election, Corbyn had won the race to succeed him, and there was an infamous spat with Diane Abbott. “I think it was the third parliamentary Labour party meeting I’d attended. I stood up and said, ‘Every person who was elected to the four great [shadow] offices of state was a man, and I need assurances that this is not how you are going to govern.’” At the end of the meeting, she went to tell Corbyn there was nothing personal in her comments. “I’d never spoken to the man before, and I said, ‘I hope you don’t take this as anything but the constructive criticism I intended it to be’, and he was like, ‘Oh no, I understand.’ He was being perfectly reasonable – I never found him anything but perfectly reasonable. But his people were considerably less forgiving than he was. And Diane came over and said, ‘You’re not the only feminist in the Labour party.’ And I was just like, ‘Oh, fuck off.’” It’s funny the way she tells it – as if to say: how could Abbott possibly have taken offence. With the benefit of hindsight, would she have reacted differently? Phillips thinks about it, and says probably not. “It really was nothing. It was, ‘Oh, fuck off’, it’s just the way I speak. It wasn’t like, ‘Fuck you, bitch!’” So many of Phillips’ stories start or end with a “fuck off”. A couple of weeks before the general election, she did Keir Starmer’s reputation the world of good when she revealed on Have I Got News For You that he’d just told her to fuck off. She had been chatting with him after being on the same train as Rishi Sunak and his team, who had locked themselves away in first class. “I was like, God, he really doesn’t want to be around the public, and I would hate that. I saw Keir that weekend and I said I was starting to feel a bit sorry for him, and Keir was like, ‘Oh, fuck off, Jess!’” And? “I said to him, ‘You’re right!’” Politics has become so full of certainties, says Phillips. Partly because of people screaming at each other on social media. Take the culture wars, she says – in the real world, most people don’t spend their life ranting about migrants, Brexit and gender. “The truth is immigration had fallen right down the list of people’s concerns until about a year ago. One of the things I talk about in the book is the disease election cycles can bring to politics. Not that I’m suggesting we get rid of democracy!” Another pause. “Though my husband is sometimes like: universal suffrage, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.” She is always quoting Tom, a former lift engineer who now does something to do with virtual reality that she doesn’t understand. “My husband says near daily, ‘Your perception is not real, nobody’s talking about this where I work, Jess.’” Tom, whom she met at school and is three years older than her, is the first cousin of former England footballer Kevin Phillips. Is Tom a good footballer? “No, he hates football. I don’t think he’s ever played in his life. Doesn’t even watch the England matches.” Phillips calls him “the best person on Earth”. You’re going to have to write a book of Tom’s quotes, I say. “Yeah. He said to me, ‘99% of what you say is just stuff I’ve said’, and I said, ‘That’s because you’re better than me, it’s just that you’re shy – and a bit rude.’” In what way rude? She changes her mind. “My husband is not rude, but he’s very upfront. So if we were to bump into somebody in the street and they were to invite us for dinner and we didn’t particularly want to go, I would say, ‘Oh, we’ll try but I think I’ve got a work thing’, and he’d just be like, ‘Oh, we don’t want to!’” Does that cause social difficulties? “When we were first together I did find it a bit jarring. Tom came home about a year ago and said, ‘I’ve just read this thing and think I might be neurodivergent.’ And everyone went, ‘No shit, mate.’” What clarified the need for more nuance in politics was a debate about chocolate she recently had with the family. Living in a household of males, she says, lots of conversations are centred on lists – best movies, best bands, etc. This time they were ranking the best chocolate. “Somebody put forward Twirl and I really love a Twirl so I was fighting for it, and my son Danny went, ‘You know what, I’ve no strong feelings!’ And I thought, in that moment, I’m going to admit when I have no strong feelings about things. There are so many things I have to vote on where I don’t have strong feelings.” We’ve run out of time and she has got to get back to Birmingham. There is so much more to talk about, so we agree to reconvene there tomorrow. * * * Tom is sick, so we meet at a cafe in New Street station instead of her home. In the middle of the night, she dropped Danny off for a school trip to Flanders. “I tweeted something saying, ‘I’m not grateful for 4am coach dropoffs on the week you become a minister.’ The amount of people who commented saying, ‘It’s so nice that there are now people in government who are doing the shit we have to do, like dropping our kids off at 4.30am to go on a coach trip.’” She chats to the woman who brings over our coffees, and a passing man stops to congratulate her on the election. It’s obvious how easily she relates to people from different backgrounds. Phillips herself went to an academic grammar school and always considered herself middle class until she got to parliament and discovered a different type of middle class. But her childhood was hardly cushioned. Her brother Luke was a drug addict by the age of 14 and turned family life upside down. “I hated him for years. It’s traumatic living with someone with a terrible addiction. When you love somebody, it’s a horrible realisation when you think it would be better if they weren’t there. I used to hate the level of sympathy my parents gave him.” Did he steal stuff from them? “Oh, Jesus, yeah. I remember when the Milibands were fighting over who got to be the leader of the Labour party, I did think, ‘Your diamond shoes are too tight for you. This morning I went to get all my belongings back from Cash Converters.’ This is a nice problem to have as siblings. Hahahaha!” Luke has made a remarkable recovery. He left school without qualifications, eventually went to university and graduated with a first, is now studying for a PhD, and runs the only university campus-based recovery community for students in the country, in Birmingham. After going to university in Leeds, Phillips worked with vulnerable people, mainly women – asylum seekers, victims of domestic abuse and rape, drug addicts who were in and out of prison. I ask if the way her political opponents treated her during the campaign could mirror patterns of domestic abuse. “I wouldn’t put it on the same level, but, yes, fundamentally it is based on the same model. What happens is there’s a slow and steady buildup to control a woman – you have to be very negative about them, bring them down, groom them to a position of weakness, isolate them from people by threatening to embarrass them at work. You close them in, and then when all those bits of control are done, you escalate to violence. That’s the usual pattern.” She says of the campaign: “They were very negative about me, constantly driving me down. Then hunting you so you can no longer go out to talk to people in public, because they’re going to turn up and scream at the person you’re talking to.” How did they hunt you? “If we advertised any door-knocking sessions they’d turn up and film the people we were speaking to, screaming about us being genocidal baby killers, that sort of thing. The people behind the doors don’t want to be filmed, so they have isolated you from being able to talk to the people you represent. I couldn’t go to hustings because they’d have people shouting at me so they could film it.” We are talking two days before the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. She is appalled by the lack of civility in modern political discourse, exemplified by Trump himself and the Brexit campaign that resulted in the assassination of Cox, a close friend, in 2016, just a year after both women had become MPs. Parliament had gone into recess because of Brexit, and Phillips went on a short holiday to Spain with her girlfriends. “I’d been at Jo’s houseboat 24 hours before. She was the last person I saw on British soil.” Cox lived on a houseboat on the Thames in London. Phillips didn’t have family in London, so Cox would often invite her and Anna Turley, another new Labour MP, over for supper. “The last thing I told Jo was I loved her. The last thing she said to me was, ‘I’m frightened, I’m scared of what’s going to happen.’ Her political antennae were better than most. I thought remain would win, but she was flagging up it might not.” She describes Cox with such tenderness – her kindness, wisdom and determination to make sure they all looked out for each other as young female MPs. When she talks about her murder, the trauma feels fresh. How did she feel when she heard about the attack on Cox? “The very first thing I felt before I knew she’d died was that it was an attack on all of us. It felt personal, like I was being hunted, which is a selfish thing to think, but that’s the truth.” Phillips later received a call to say Cox had died, and she went into denial. “I just sat in silence, staring. And my friend Ruth, who is a nurse, sat next to me quietly for 12 hours. I couldn’t process it. I left Jo voice messages and text messages after I’d been told she’d died. I knew she was dead.” What did you say? “‘I love you and I’ll speak to you when you get better.’ I properly disassociated from what was happening. Total and utter delusion. So, yes, it had a pretty bad effect on me.” Did she think of quitting after Cox’s murder or the many threats to herself? “No. But Danny said to me I don’t want you to do the job, it’s not worth it. I said the trouble is it is worth it. To quit in the face of threats and violence is to allow threats and violence to win.” Today, hard right or extremist views appear to be on the rise in Britain. While the general election was a landslide for Labour in terms of seats (412 out of 650), it only won 33.8% of the vote share. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage’s rightwing populist Reform UK party secured 14% of the vote share (but only five seats). Does she find it … ? She completes the question for me. “Terrifying? Yes.” She calls it a broad but shallow victory. How does Labour turn that into a more meaningful victory? “You have to deliver. People think the upset in my constituency was all strictly Gaza. It wasn’t. Gaza was the catalyst for years and years of everything being shit. Reform and the Workers party are just against things. The policies of grievance are very easy to sell; easiest trick in the book. Any fucker can do it. Building something based on hope is much harder. But you have to be honest about delivery. You can’t just go to the places where the Labour party did badly and whack a youth centre in there. That won’t work, either. It has to be based on genuine delivery and being honest about how long improvement will take. That is how you take a loveless landslide into a second term of a Labour government.” She is convinced Farage will be hopeless as a constituency MP and as a performer in the Commons. “It’s like with George Galloway. His whole power is in the hat. He’s been in parliament recently and he’s not allowed to wear the hat, and he just looks like a shuffling man who stands up and speaks for three minutes. I’m like, oh my God, you’re like Samson. You’ve got no hat, you’ve got no sparkle. I think Farage is going to be the same. Parliament crushes people. It crushed Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson never managed to land a moment of bombast in parliament, because it’s a bigger institution than you. I am better in parliament than Boris Johnson and I’ll be better than Nigel Farage.” It’s approaching 3.30pm, another cut-off point for Phillips. This time she’s returning to the airport to collect her older son, Harry, who has been on holiday with his friends. She suggests that I travel with her so we can finish the interview. “I’m not good at driving, but I’m very confident,” she says. “Just like my politics!” She addresses her satnav. “Navigate to Birmingham airport,” she says in a brusque voice, before adding “please” apologetically. “Have to be polite to AI!” In 2020, Phillips was one of six candidates who stood in the race to succeed Corbyn – won by Starmer at a canter. How much did she want it? “Not at all.” Why stand then? “It was out of loyalty to the Labour party, actually. I hated every moment of the process. It was the worst thing I’ve ever done. It turned me into a shell of a person because I’m not good having loads of people around me going, ‘Don’t say this, don’t do that.’ All these people up in your grill. I would never do it again.” I ask her what she means about doing it for the party. “In my life and in the lives of my family the Labour party has been the greatest vehicle for social change that benefits the masses. It’s the only vehicle that has ever done that, as far as I’m concerned. And I desperately wanted to rebuild it.” She comes to a sudden stop. “It sounds really noble now. I’m not sure that’s the way I felt about it at the time.” How much of her is nobility and how much is ego? “Ooh, 50-50.” How big is your ego? “Massive. Of course, I’ve got a massive ego!” Has it always been massive? “Yes, 100%. I was told I was clever from an early age and that sticks. I was singled out. I was the cleverest girl in my class from the age of four. You get an ego about it.” She calls herself “a bombastic attention-seeking sort”, and says if everybody was like her in politics it would be chaos. In what way is she bombastic? “Well, I’m loud, aren’t I? And I’ll crack jokes. And I’ll say things that some people will go, ‘Oooof! I can’t believe you said that!’” She says she used to feel nervous before making speeches to the point of taking beta blockers to calm herself down. “Now I don’t feel nervous before, I feel nervous after. Because I think, shit, what did I just say? What’s coming back to bite me?” Do you always like yourself? “No. I think I’m awful sometimes. I’m usually awful when I’m not very well in my head. I suffer from anxiety. And when that is at a peak, I don’t like myself very much then, but that is clinical.” She says she can be “mean” to people. “My nan’s favourite saying was, ‘Go in the corner and have a word with yourself.’ I have to have a word with myself all the time.” You can come across as someone who’s a little in love with yourself, I say. “No, no, no. Not at all. My protective characteristic is to grow into a monstrous manic thing. And that’s much less understood than people who shrink away and are nervous and quiet. People don’t feel any sympathy for it. And why should they, because it normally means I’m being an arse.” We reach the airport. Harry calls on her phone to say he has just got through security. I ask her a few quick-fire questions before leaving. Who’s the most moral MP you’ve worked with? “Ooh, that’s a good question. I would say Diana Johnson. D’you know what? Keir Starmer’s not far off it.” The funniest? “This never comes across on the television, but Rachel Reeves is a hoot in private, particularly when she’s pissed off about something. And, let me tell you, Wes Streeting is an almost perfect mimic. His Emily Thornberry is second to none.” Who’s the worst? “I’m going to have to say Farage at the moment.” A couple of drivers are beeping away for all they’re worth. “Why are people beeping at me? Maybe it’s not me. Why do I assume it’s me? It’s because I’m an egomaniac! Right, I’m going to have to kick you out because four people are about to get in the car.” As I leave, I ask if she still has a plaque on her desk saying: “Well-behaved women rarely make history.” She nods. Does she think she’ll be better behaved now she’s a minister? “Probably. But I’ll never ever be truly well behaved, will I?” Let’s Be Honest by Jess Phillips (Simon &amp; Schuster, £20).

                    "bodyText": "Elon Musk’s X platform is under pressure from data regulators after it emerged that users are consenting to their posts being used to build artificial intelligence systems via a default setting on the app. The UK and Irish data watchdogs said they have contacted X over the apparent attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without them knowing about it. An X user highlighted the issue on Friday, pointing to a setting on the app that activated by default and permitted the account holder’s posts to be used for training Grok, an AI chatbot built by Musk’s xAI business. Under UK GDPR, which is based on the EU data regulation of the same name, companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”. The setting, which comes with an already ticked box, states that you “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”. According to the X user, the setting can only be turned off on the web version of X. Data regulators immediately expressed concern about the default setting. In the UK, the information commissioner’s office (ICO) said it was “making enquiries” with X. “Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO. “They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way.” The Data Protection Commission (DPC) in the Republic of Ireland, the lead regulator for X across the European Union, said it had already been speaking to Musk’s company about data collection and AI models this week and was “surprised” to learn of the default setting. “The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner. Large language models are the technology underpinning chatbots such as ChatGPT and Grok and are fed vast amounts of data scraped from the internet in order to spot patterns in language and build a statistical understanding of it. This ultimately enables chatbots to churn out convincing-looking answers to queries. However, this approach has met with opposition in multiple areas including from news publishers, authors – who argue that the process breaches copyright laws – and regulators. This month Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it would not release an advanced version of its artificial intelligence model in the EU, blaming the decision on the “unpredictable” behaviour of regulators. X has been contacted for comment."

                    "bodyText": "Top of the weekend to you all. A gentle reminder to my fellow Australians that there is a time and place for the “Oi! Oi! Oi!” chant and that was Sydney almost a quarter of a century ago. With that Olympics-related PSA out of the way, go the Boomers, go the Tillies – and rest assured that from here this newsletter is a sport-free zone. Kind of. 1. ‘We pledged not to eat each other’ When Dougal Robertson sold the farm to sail his family around the world, he wanted to teach his four children about life. Mission accomplished: their ship was attacked by orcas, forcing its six passengers on to a raft where they barely survived on rations, turtle meat and by sucking the eyeballs out of fish once their tinned water ran out. Dougal’s son Douglas, who was 18 when the Robertsons abandoned ship in 1972, recalls the 38 days lost at sea, the joy of the rescue, and how the family members coped in the aftermath. The honorary Robertson: Robin Williams – a financial analyst, not the other one – joined the voyage 12 months in. The deal was he would teach the children English and maths to pay his way, but Douglas says his role became even more vital. “When you’re on a raft in the Pacific it’s fantastic to have someone who can just talk. To hear that human noise. He kept everybody’s morale up with his chirpy chitchat.” How long will it take to read: Six minutes. Further reading: The rest of our How we survive series. 2. Shooting down some ‘nepo baby’ myths Sirin Kale’s interview with the actor Zosia Mamet – who you may know from Girls, Mad Men or, umm, Madame Web – is a fairly standard celebrity profile until conversation turns to her family. Mamet’s mother (Lindsay Crouse) is an actor who dieted constantly as her daughter grew up. Mamet says that contributed to her own eating disorder, although she makes clear she does not blame her mother. And her father, the playwright David Mamet, told a book festival in April that Hollywood diversity targets are “fascist totalitarianism”. Mamet argues that being a so-called “nepo baby” has at times made forging her own career more of a challenge. “Because people knew I was coming in with a famous name,” she says. “It meant that I was walking into the room with baggage.” On why Madame Web was such a turkey: “Nothing creative made by committee is ever brilliant.” How long will it take to read: Five minutes. 3. ‘My family were all Nazis – and they had no regrets’ Martin Pollack was 14 when he learned his biological father, Gerhard Bast, had been an officer of the SS and a leading member of the Gestapo. His mother was also a Nazi, as was his stepfather, his uncle and his paternal grandparents. Pollack ceased contact with his family as an adult and didn’t delve into their dark past until after his mother had died. By that stage in his late 50s, he learned his father was not a “monster” or a “sadist” but an “ordinary man” – and there were many like him. “Of course his deep involvement in the murderous Nazi regime was partly an outcome of his upbringing, but this doesn’t minimise his guilt,” Pollack says. “He knew what he was doing.” *** “I sometimes think my family members would have become admirers of Putin and his ilk. They were convinced that democracy was poison and only a strong man can save us.” – Pollack on the echoes of national socialism that still exist How long will it take to read: Ten minutes. 4. Why it’s time to start panicking about AI The novelist and playwright Daniel Kehlmann wrote in 2020 about his experiment with a large language model – a type of generative AI. He urges anyone interested not to read that book. “It is so outdated it’s as though it came from a different period in world history,” he writes, “like a text about the first railways or a biplane airshow.” Developments in the field are happening fast. There is a lot of money to be made. And Kehlmann argues it is time for governments to summon the collective will “to rein in AI’s powers and protect life as we know it” before it is too late. A warning from the writers’ room: One of Kehlmann’s friends recently road-tested a screenplay AI. The TV series it created and scripted from his prompts was so convincing he said he’d be out of a job in three years. How long will it take to read: Four minutes. Further reading: Speaking of art that machines could churn out, electro house is back. 5. The man who ate 159 tacos in 10 minutes Takeru Kobayashi is competitive eating’s first elite athlete – not that you’d know it by looking at him. At just 68kg and 5ft 8in he’s a welterweight in boxing terms, but when it comes to smashing ridiculous amounts of food down his gullet his glut of world records make him the undisputed heavyweight champ. Now 46, Kobayashi is making a comeback – in a livestreamed Netflix special, naturally – against his fiercest rival, the American Joey Chestnut. Why is he putting himself through six months of intensive training (surprise ingredient: lots of water) after five years out of the game? “I never had a retirement match.” Long-term injuries: Kobayashi is as battered and bruised as any sportsperson, though his ailments are unique: arthritis in the jaw from excessive chewing and tooth erosion among them. How long will it take to read: Four minutes. Further reading: A former Olympic gymnast on why being super fit doesn’t necessarily mean being healthy. Sign up Enjoying the Five Great Reads email?

                    "bodyText": "Spending on artificial intelligence could hit a staggering $1tn, according to analysts concerned about whether there will be a return on such a spree. Mark Zuckerberg’s answer this week to such jitters was to release his latest AI system for free. Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B is its most powerful yet, it says, and one of the most capable in the world. While the tech company didn’t disclose how much it cost to train, Zuckerberg, its co-founder and chief executive, has previously disclosed a $10.5bn (£8.9bn) investment in just the chips required to power its AI data centres – with the rest of the electronics, the electricity itself, and the physical building an additional cost on top of that. Yet despite the exorbitant outlay, the parent of Facebook and Instagram will charge you nothing for it. If you can get hold of a computer powerful enough to run it, you don’t have to pay Zuckerberg a cent. Whether that gamble will pay off matters to more than just Meta, though: a big bet by investors and Meta’s tech peers is hingeing on the same question. In June, analysts at Goldman Sachs published a note with the sceptical title: “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?” It pointed to a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years by the tech industries, other companies and utilities on infrastructure, including chips and power grids. That prompted the question: “Will this large spend ever pay off?” The note covers a range of views on whether the spree will bring acceptable returns, including an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Daron Acemoglu, who argues that “truly transformative changes” brought about by AI “won’t happen quickly”. In other words, the beneficial economic return from this boom might take longer than investors expect. The research also questions whether power supply can keep up with the demand related to training and operating AI systems – and asks the same about the chips needed to power those models. There are also more optimistic takes from Goldman analysts, who argue that AI will ultimately automate 25% of all work tasks in the US (thus making the economy more productive but also creating new tasks and products) and that the spending boom is not out of whack with previous tech investment sprees. However, Sequoia Capital, an early investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, has made it clear that AI companies need to work hard to pay back all that investment in infrastructure such as chips and data centres. A prior estimate that AI companies will need to earn $200bn to pay back their investment has risen to $600bn, wrote Sequoia partner David Cahn. Cahn stressed that backing AI so strongly would “almost certainly” be worthwhile but “the road ahead is going to be a long one”. Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, asked in a note this month whether large language models – the technology underpinning tools such as ChatGPT – “might also be a trap”, because while ChatGPT might look like a full-fledged product, it isn’t. Evans draws an analogy between LLMs and the first iPhones and the appearance of the internet – the potential is there, but other things need to happen as well. “When most technologies first appear they aren’t ready yet and it’s not clear why they’re useful, and they need a bunch more work,” he says. “The iPhone didn’t have 3G and it didn’t have apps. The web arrived in the early 90s, but no one had a modem, let alone broadband. A whole bunch of stuff had to happen before the web could take off.” Evans adds that chatbots have worked well for people who need time-saving fixes for coding and marketing, but it has yet to bring fixes in other areas. “There are very specific cases where this already saves a huge amount of time, but it hasn’t generalised to everybody yet.” He adds: “The feeling that I think most people have looking at ChatGPT is, OK, this is amazingly cool … but what am I supposed to do with this?” This week, OpenAI announced it is testing a search engine in the US, in what could become a direct challenge to search behemoth Google, which has launched AI-generated search answers, too. OpenAI has also hired a former Meta and Twitter executive, Kevin Weil, as its chief product officer to help answer the question: “What am I supposed to do with this?” This week, tech news site the Information reported that OpenAI could lose as much as $5bn this year, based on analysis of internal financial figures and interviews with sources, as it amasses $8.5bn-worth of operating costs including $4bn a year on renting servers from Microsoft and $3bn a year on training models. Full-year revenue could be anywhere between $3.5bn and $4.5bn per year the Information reported, implying a loss of up to $5bn. San Francisco-based OpenAI makes money from charging companies to build consumer products using its models, or letting companies build in-house chatbots with its technology, as well as generating revenue from charging users $20 a month to access a more powerful version of ChatGPT. Google and Anthropic also sell subscriptions to AI systems for $20 a month, while Cohere sells its models to business customers for tasks such as coding or data analysis. The Information admitted its OpenAI calculations were “guesstimates” but if they are right, the company needs to raise cash over the next 12 months. OpenAI declined to comment, although with Microsoft as its main financial backer it could call upon a wealthy benefactor – albeit with regulators circling. But even as tech companies have been fighting for domination at the “frontier” of AI, investing billions in building bigger and better systems, a second front has opened up in a more traditional battle: cost. OpenAI’s most recent release isn’t GPT-4o, the headline-grabbing “multimodal” system that sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson that it sparked a lawsuit. Instead, it’s GPT-4o mini, a stripped-back version of the same AI that the company offers to third-party developers at less than 5% of the cost of its frontier system – undercutting the previous cheapest models, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. On Tuesday, Meta’s release of the latest version of its Llama system undercut OpenAI. Again, while the attention was on the frontier version of the model, dubbed 405B, the company was equally eager to push its smallest LLM, 8B. Unlike its competitors, Llama is available for anyone to download and run on their own systems, with cloud providers such as Groq offering it for a third of the price of OpenAI’s competitor systems. Llama 3.1 8B underperforms those OpenAI equivalents, per benchmarks from Artificial Analysis, but for the price, who can complain? Meta calls Llama “open source”, although critics dispute the claim: it’s possible to download the model and use it with a fairly free licence but the training data remains entirely closed, and the model is not free for anyone to use for any purpose. Some of the restrictions are practical: the copyright status of training data for large language models is, at best, controversial. Meta keeps the specific data it trained Llama 3.1 on a secret, and almost certainly lacks the licence to redistribute it free of charge. Other restrictions have more commercial weight behind them. By keeping restrictions on Llama 3.1’s use in place, Meta places itself at the middle of any future sector that grows around its AI: even if it doesn’t charge directly for access to the model, it gets to control the direction of development, and can always close future avenues if competitors grow too big using its tech. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg said: “I believe the Llama 3.1 release will be an inflection point in the industry… I hope you’ll join us on this journey to bring the benefits of AI to everyone in the world.” For investors and other tech companies, those benefits need to produce a meaningful return."

Here is a wrap of the main news: Former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has lost her legal challenge against an anti-corruption watchdog finding that she engaged in “serious corrupt conduct”. (She had argued the finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption was invalid because the commissioner was no longer at Icac when the findings were handed down.) Nine’s newspaper journalists went on strike from 11am today after crisis talks yesterday failed to stop a strike at Nine Entertainment’s mastheads, with journalists from the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday rallying outside newsrooms of Nine Entertainment across the country. Queensland parliamentary estimates heard the Queensland police has yet to show any “drastic” improvement in human rights, years after the legislation of the state’s Human Rights Act was passed. The Northern Territory government will not renew a lease for Energy Resources Australia (ERA) on the Jabiluka uranium mine. The lease had been previously granted for for 42 years. Anthony Albanese has joined with his Canadian and New Zealand counterparts to say a ceasefire in Gaza is “needed desperately” and to urge Israel to “listen to the concerns of the international community”. Have a great weekend, and see you next week. Bus driver charged after pedestrian fatally struck in Brisbane A Brisbane bus driver has been charged with manslaughter after a pedestrian was fatally struck at a city intersection. Police allege Carl James Van Der Wiel, 59, was driving the bus carrying 10 passengers when the pedestrian aged in his 40s was hit at South Brisbane on 28 June. Emergency services arrived about 11.30pm but the pedestrian was declared dead at the scene. None of the bus passengers were injured. Van Der Wiel appeared in Brisbane magistrates court on Friday. He was granted bail and the matter was adjourned until 26 August. - Australian Associated Press The new joint statement from the prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand reiterated that they were “committed to working towards an irreversible path to achieving a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely within internationally recognised borders”. They said this was “the only realistic option to achieve a just and enduring peace”. The statement included some strong language directed at Israel in the wake of last Friday’s international court of justice ruling that the continued occupation of territory Israel seized in 1967 was illegal under international law: We call on Israel to respond substantively to the ICJ’s advisory opinion, and ensure accountability for ongoing acts of violence against Palestinians by extremist settlers, reverse the record expansion of settlements in the West Bank which are illegal under international law, and work towards a two-state solution. To date, the Israeli government has labelled the ICJ ruling as “not legally binding” and “blatantly one-sided”. Read more on that issue here: It’s the third time the prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand have issued a joint statement about developments in the Middle East (the first, in December 2023, was to press for a ceasefire, and the second, in February, was to oppose an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah). Today’s joint statement described the situation in Gaza as “catastrophic” and said the human suffering was “unacceptable” and “cannot continue”. The three prime ministers said they remained “unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas for the atrocities of 7 October and ongoing acts of terror”, urging the group to “lay down its arms and release all hostages”. The prime ministers said Israel “must listen to the concerns of the international community”, noting that the protection of civilians “is paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law”. Repeating language from their previous statement, the prime ministers said: Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas. It must end. The prime ministers said they stood fully behind “the comprehensive ceasefire deal, outlined by President Biden and endorsed by the UN security council”, and they called on all parties “to agree to the deal”. They said any delay in securing the ceasefire would “only see more lives lost”. Anthony Albanese has joined with his Canadian and New Zealand counterparts to say a ceasefire in Gaza is “needed desperately” and to urge Israel to “listen to the concerns of the international community”. In a joint statement issued this afternoon, Albanese and fellow prime ministers Justin Trudeau and Christopher Luxon also said they were “gravely concerned about the prospect of further escalation across the region”, including between Hezbollah and Israel. They said further hostilities would “put tens of thousands of civilians in Lebanon and Israel at risk”, a concern that “only makes a ceasefire in Gaza more urgent”. The leaders urged “all involved actors to exercise restraint and de-escalate” and added: A wider scale war would have disastrous consequences for Israel and Lebanon, and for civilians across the region. More details to come. Here is the last installation of AAP’s wrap on cabinet reshuffle talk. With Northern Territory senator Malarndirri McCarthy expected to take the Indigenous Australians portfolio after serving as Burney’s assistant minister, a final cabinet spot remains. It could go to a junior minister such as Albanese’s confidant Pat Conroy, or an assistant minister could be called in. Assistant ministers and senators Tim Ayres, Jenny McAllister and Anthony Chisholm are all viewed as strong contenders to be promoted. “We are a caucus that is batting very deep ... there’s dozens of colleagues who have very strong capability, very strong capacity,” Ayres said. New assistant ministers would also need to be picked. Northern Territory MP Marion Scrymgour could pick up Senator McCarthy’s assistant Indigenous affairs position. The future of home affairs minister Clare O’Neil is uncertain, with speculation she could be moved sideways into another ministry to allow someone such as frontbencher Murray Watt to take over the portfolio. Burney won the inner-Sydney seat of Barton with more than 50% of the primary vote at the 2022 federal election. “The most important thing ... is for me to support whoever it is in the role and to give them the space to be able to chart their own path,” she told ABC Radio. - Australian Associated Press More from AAP on cabinet reshuffling. Labor backbencher Kate Thwaites, touted for a potential promotion, said the government was focused on issues rather than on themselves. “Our focus is exactly where it needs to be, providing people with cost-of-living relief, making sure our economy is as strong as possible,” she told Sky News. MP Ged Kearney, another candidate for promotion, said the prime minister “has made it very clear that he has utmost confidence in his cabinet” when asked whether changes were likely to be minor. But the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is pushing for the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, to be sacked over the handling of a high court decision that ruled indefinite detention was illegal. The decision forced the government to release about 150 detainees – including some who had committed serious offences and served prison time – and the Coalition has argued more should have been done to keep them locked up. “If Andrew Giles doesn’t get the flick, I don’t know who does,” Dutton said. - Australian Associated Press More to come Labor MPs are publicly spruiking stability as Anthony Albanese decides on the cabinet team he will likely take to the federal election. Labor’s ministry maintains a factional balance between the left and right, which convene and put people forward through different processes before the prime minister assigns portfolios. Ministers Linda Burney and Brendan O’Connor will retire at the next federal election, which is due by May 2025. They will step back from cabinet immediately to bring in fresh legs as the race to polling day starts to heat up. Albanese has put a premium on stability, having gone the first two years of his term without dumping or moving ministers. Cabinet minister and former Labor leader Bill Shorten, a factional opponent of Albanese, has called for promotions to be merit-based. “Loyalty is not always rewarded but merit should be,” he told Nine’s Today Show today. But he too lauded the longevity of Albanese’s first cabinet. “Normally in a first term of a Coalition government, they lose six or seven of their ministers, so, really Albo set a record for stability,” he said. - Australian Associated Press More to come Nine CEO dodges questions after staff decision to strike Nine CEO Mike Sneesby has been door-stopped by Australian journalists outside his boutique hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine in Paris. Hours after after his newspaper staff in Australia went on strike, a Channel Seven reporter asked Sneesby whether it was appropriate for him to have carried the Olympic torch as part of the relay. “Look guys, (I’ve) just got back from dinner and it’s not really the time to have a chat,” Sneesby said. “Why don’t you stop and have a chat to us now?” the reporter said. “Because I’m meeting my family,” Sneesby said. “You’re the boss of a media business here for work – or are you here on a holiday with your family?” the reporter questioned. Victorian premier Jacinta Allan’s comments follow a vote of no confidence by the ambulance union earlier today, in which 97.8% of members endorsed a call to sack Ambulance Victoria’s current executive. About 4200 members supported the move, which called for the minister for health, health infrastructure and ambulance services, Mary-Anne Thomas to appoint new management. Responding to the vote, Ambulance Victoria’s chief executive Jane Miller said the organisation acknowledged the result and was “committed to rebuilding the trust of the workforce”. “Our people, along with the patients they care for, are our absolute priority,” she said in a statement. We are negotiating in good faith ... to deliver an enterprise agreement which is fair for all and acknowledges the significant value of our people. Ambulance union secretary Danny Hill said the no-confidence vote was a “massive wake-up call” to both the Ambulance Victoria board and the Victorian government. He told AAP that paramedics were being “sent out like robots, just to continue working hours and hours past the end of their shift”. The biggest factors crippling the ambulance service and our members, are hospital ramping and call-taking accuracy. [Ambulance Victoria’s] response is always ‘that’s out of our control’. The workforce is sick of hearing that. On the same day, about 150 members attended a rally outside Thomas’ office to raise awareness of the ongoing strikes, the union said. Thomas’ office has been contacted by AAP for comment. - Australian Associated Press Paramedic dispute unsustainable, Victorian premier says Paramedics in Victoria have engaged in five months of industrial action as they continue to call for a new enterprise agreement, which they have been negotiating for 18 months. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said she was concerned about the “protracted” dispute between management and paramedics and the situation was not sustainable. “We do need to see better, harmonious relationships,” she told reporters today. It’s important that the Ambulance Victoria is focused on the hard work of paramedics, not on these ongoing relationship challenges. - Australian Associated Press More to come The Queensland police commissioner, Steve Gollschewski, has faced questions about the Guardian’s ‘in the box’ watch house investigation in parliamentary budget estimates. Gollschewski said he is “concerned about the levels of complaints we’re seeing coming out of our watch houses” and has appointed a deputy commissioner with reviewing the culture at police watch houses. Greens MP Michael Berkman asked whether police routinely use isolation cells – which are supposed to only be used for safety reasons – for punishment. Footage broadcast exclusively by the Guardian shows one officer telling a young Indigenous female inmate who was put in isolation, “you were disobeying the rules, missy”. “I would be extremely concerned if that were the case. I’m not aware – and would think that that would certainly not be what we were doing in a practice. But if anyone has got information otherwise it’d be certainly wanting to hear about it,” Gollschewski said. Gollschewski said he was also “not satisfied with the explanation” he’d been given so far about another incident at a Brisbane watch house reported by the ABC. The state government overturned the Queensland Human Rights Act last year in order to reverse a court decision banning the use of watch houses for children. Estimates also heard that police unintentionally shared the details of a victim of crime with her alleged attacker in an apparent data blunder. And the police minister, Mark Ryan, announced the rollout of naloxone – a drug which counteracts the effects of an opiate overdose – in police tactical first aid kits. Two teenagers have been charged over the alleged vandalism of federal Labor MP Josh Burns’ Melbourne office. Windows were smashed and covered in painted slogans including “Zionism is fascism” at the electoral office at Barkly Street in St Kilda, on 19 June. At the time, Burns alleged the damage was a “politically motivated attack” and acknowledged that images of the incident might be distressing for people. Police charged an 18-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy on Thursday with burglary and two counts of criminal damage. The charges included a second incident of alleged vandalism with red paint at a building on St Kilda Road in Melbourne, on 17 July. Here is the full story: Statement from the NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, on Gladys Berejiklian: Today’s decision by the NSW court of appeal underscores the legal challenges in contesting Icac findings due to the Act’s limitations on ‘merits’ reviews. The standards required by law applies equally to everyone. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Rafqa Touma will see you through the rest of the evening. Take care, and enjoy your weekend! Woman found guilty of 73 charges of wildlife and animal cruelty A Violet Town woman has been found guilty of 73 charges of wildlife and animal cruelty offences for poisoning wedge-tailed eagles and keeping dead wildlife in her freezer. The woman had pleaded guilty to 26 charges relating to the illegal possession of wildlife, after a search of her property found almost 130 dead wedge-tailed eagles. She had contested 47 other charges, including allegations she had laid baits to kill wedge-tailed eagles. In the Victorian magistrates court in Shepparton on Wednesday, magistrate David Faram said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the woman was involved by intentionally assisting and/or encouraging the commission of the offences, even if he was not able to conclude she was solely responsible. He found she had laid baits that were found in the paddocks in 2019 or was complicit in doing so, and that she must have had some knowledge or involvement in the destruction of the birds. She will be sentenced after a further mention date in September. The Northern Territory government will not renew a lease for Energy Resources Australia (ERA) on the Jabiluka Uranium mine. The lease had been previously granted for for 42 years. Last month, the Northern Territory issued a two-year order to prevent mining and exploration at Jabiluka while the decision was pending on whether to grant the leaseholder a 10-year extension. The state’s mining minister Mark Monaghan said: We have gone through a thorough process to ensure that all stakeholder views have been considered in this decision. The federal government advice, along with the wishes of the Mirarr people, were critical to this process and outcome. As Karen Middleton reported last month, Jabiluka is the site of one of the world’s biggest uranium deposits. ERA, which is majority-owned by Rio Tinto, has held the mining lease since 1991. The mine is surrounded by Kakadu national park and the Mirrar people want the land incorporated into the park. You can read the full background on this from last month below: Greens senator says Great Barrier Reef’s exclusion from ‘in danger’ list is ‘triumph of spin over science’ Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson says the decision to keep the Great Barrier Reef off the world heritage “in danger” list is a “triumph of spin over science and denies the reality of the current prospects for the reef.” (Graham Readfearn reported on this earlier in the blog here). In a post to X, Whish-Wilson said he travelled to Heron Island in April this year to witness the most recent bleaching event at the reef with his own eyes, and “one thing was undeniable - the Great Barrier Reef is in danger”. Just this week Labor announced new permits for gas drilling along Australia’s west and south-east coastlines. If we are to have any hope of limiting warming to 1.5C as dictated in Unesco’s decision, there can be no new coal and gas. Labor remains in denial of this fact … The more coal and gas mines the Albanese government rips open, the closer the Great Barrier Reef is to becoming irrevocably degraded and changed forever. It’s new coal and gas or the reef – you can’t have both. Homelessness, harm, health risks for refugee women Specialist homelessness services say domestic violence is the main reason for women who are refugees in Australia seeking their help, AAP reports. An Australian Institute of Health Welfare report has found that one in eight humanitarian entrants (male and female) received support from specialist housing services, compared to one in 50 from the permanent migrant population. Of the humanitarian refugees seeking help, three in five were women. Domestic violence was the main reason (17.8% of the time) that led to housing vulnerability. Refugees were almost twice as likely to be hospitalised or attend an emergency department as other permanent migrants over a five-year period (2016-2021). Falls, contact with objects and transport accidents were the three most common reasons for going to the hospital. But the report also found that humanitarian entrants were being admitted for injuries caused by assault at greater rates (more than six times higher) than other permanent migrants. There are over 210,000 refugees in Australia who have arrived in the last two decades. Overall they are younger (31.8) on average compared to the general population born in Australia (39.3) and other permanent migrants (37.4), according to the latest census in 2021. Three men have been charged over the alleged forced marriage of two teenage children in Perth. The Australian federal police said this is the first time it had laid charges in Western Australia for this crime. The men – two related to the boy, and one related to the girl – faced Perth magistrates court today, each charged with one count of causing a person to enter a forced marriage. The maximum penalty is nine years in prison. Police will allege the teenagers – one aged between 13 and 15, and the other aged 17 – wanted to date each other, but the relatives told them they would have to be married for cultural reasons. The men then allegedly facilitated the marriage of the children in a religious ceremony last year. AFP detective superintendent Peter Chwal said the legal age for marriage in Australia is 18, and while a child aged 16 to 18 can obtain permission from a court to marry, the person they wed must be an adult. He said forced marriage was a complex crime because it often involved family members as victims and perpetrators. Forced marriage has been illegal in Australia since 2013. Cold front to bring snow to Tasmania, Victoria and NSW this weekend A wintry cold front will bring snow to low levels across Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales this weekend, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Snowfall amounts will be low, it said in a post to X. ADF chief to travel to Fiji and Vanuatu this weekend The chief of the Australian defence force (ADF), Adm David Johnston, will travel to Fiji and Vanuatu from today until Sunday. It will be his first international trip as chief of the ADF, since being appointed in April. In Fiji, Johnston will formally hand over 14 Bushmasters purchased by the Fijian government. In Vanuatu he will attend the commissioning ceremony of RVS Sokomanu, the nation’s new landing craft. Johnston said: Australia and Vanuatu’s bilateral relationship is founded on our shared values and vision for a secure and prosperous Blue Pacific. We recognise the impact of natural disasters across the Pacific and are committed to working with Pacific partners to respond when disasters occur, build disaster resilience and support communities to recover. Striking Nine Entertainment journalists gathered outside the company’s headquarters in Melbourne and Sydney at 11am today to express their frustration with management’s negotiations for a new enterprise bargaining agreement. They have begun a five-day strike which will see the company’s mastheads produced by exempt members of staff, including management. Staff in Melbourne held a homemade replica Olympic torch and posters saying “Don’t Torch Journalism”, references to CEO Mike Sneesby’s decision to run in the torch relay in Paris. Sneesby told staff he is “profoundly disappointed” talks had failed to stop the strike. At 11am the majority of journalists at Nine’s newspapers logged off for five days, leaving the following message on the the Age’s rolling news blog: That’s where we’ll leave today’s national news blog. Thanks so much for reading. Last night, editorial staff from the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday voted to reject a last-minute pay offer from management. We can tell you the striking staff won’t be posting anything else though, because sources say they have been locked out of the publishing system. They have also been logged out of the internal messaging system, Slack. Senator urges Albanese government to support a truth and justice commission Greens senator Dorinda Cox has urged the government to support a bill for a truth and justice commission. This comes following a report in the Age that the government was considering a minimalist, community-led truth-telling process to “fill the void” on reconciliation after the voice referendum loss, led by local Indigenous groups to unearth local histories. In a statement, Cox called on the government to implement the Uluru statement from the heart in full and back the Greens legislation: A ‘minimalist’ model will do nothing and certainly won’t allow us to record the pre-colonial history of Australia and make recommendations to the parliament on how to address the ongoing systemic issues, which will bring practical changes to close the gap for our people, we need something stronger like the Victorian model. We cannot change the past, but we can build a better future for First Nations and non-indigenous Australians with a federal truth and justice commission, which will help us to heal and move forward together as a nation. The Nine Network strike, in pictures Here are some photos from the Nine Network newspaper journalists strike, filtering through from AAP: Continuing from our last post: After visits to Laos and Japan, Penny Wong will fly to South Korea where the Australian foreign affairs minister will meet with her South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, in Seoul. Wong said South Korea and Australia were “building on our strategic alignment with expanded bilateral and regional cooperation, including on the energy transition and economic security”. She said she would then visit the UN Command Buildings in the Joint Security Area within the Demilitarised Zone between South Korea and North Korea, describing it as “an enduring symbol of international cooperation in addressing North Korea’s challenges to security and stability”. Wong said her travel to Laos, Japan and South Korea was “an opportunity to promote Australia’s interests and deepen collaboration with key partners and regional architecture in pursuit of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region”. Foreign minister Penny Wong going to Laos, Japan, South Korea The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is setting off on a trip to Laos, Japan and South Korea. The agenda in Laos this weekend includes a meeting with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), following up on outcomes from a special summit held earlier this year in Melbourne. Laos will also host a meeting of foreign ministers from East Asia Summit countries (in addition to Asean members, this high-powered grouping brings in Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US). Wong will then travel to Tokyo, where she is scheduled to attend a meeting of the Quad foreign ministers on Monday. It’s the second time Wong has visited Japan this month. (The previous trip was focused on talks with Pacific leaders.) The Quad is a grouping of Australia, Japan, India and the US. It is viewed warily by Beijing, which argues it is an anti-China initiative. Quad members reject such framing. Wong said the Quad was “working closely with Indo-Pacific countries and institutions to deliver on a positive agenda that responds tangibly to the region’s priorities and most pressing challenges”. Wong said she and fellow Quad foreign ministers would seek to progress “cooperation on infrastructure, supply chains, connectivity, education, research, humanitarian and disaster responses, counterterrorism and security”. The Queensland police has yet to show any “drastic” improvement in human rights, years after the legislation of the state’s Human Rights Act was passed, parliament has heard. Greens MP Michael Berkman used parliamentary estimates to question human rights commissioner Scott McDougall. “Has the commission identified any shift in the way QPS [Queensland police service] is approaching any human rights complaints that are brought in respect of the police service or QPS officers?” he asked McDougall said the commission is currently collaborating with the police to improve its hiring practices, and they have established a good working relationship. I am yet to see any evidence, though, that that relationship is translating into a drastic improvement in the way that human rights are protected and respected by Queensland police officers. That’s something that’s certainly within my ambit though, it’s certainly a goal of the commission. The state Human Rights Act became law in 2019. ‘Unprecedented’ bad behaviour at Queensland council elections The head of the Queensland electoral commission has told parliament there was “unprecedented” bad behaviour at this year’s local council elections. ECQ commissioner Pat Vidgen said today: The poor behaviour of candidates and candidate workers in some local governments in March, such as Redlands, was unprecedented. On Tuesday, Labor premier Steven Miles made national headlines by criticising the opposition for using AI to create a TikTok video of him dancing. But Vidgen said the ECQ had few powers outside proscribed election periods and even then their legislation permitted them only to regulate the proper authorisation of electoral material. The threats to electoral integrity in western democracies is more greater than ever. What we’re seeing is the growth of misinformation, disinformation is on the rise, especially across social media platforms. Cyber threats are real, the threat of foreign interference is real to elections. The use of artificial intelligence is expanding. And the physical threats to temporary election staff is rising. Vidgen said the ECQ could and did ask social media platforms to take down problematic posts on social media, but the responses were “inconsistent”. Former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has responded to losing her legal challenge against an anti-corruption watchdog’s finding that she engaged in “serious corrupt conduct”, saying: “I always worked my hardest to look after the welfare and interests of the people of NSW.” Berejiklian said: I would like to thank the NSW court of appeal for its consideration of these matters given the limited nature of a challenge that can be made to Icac findings by any citizen. As the court noted, the Icac Act does not permit a “merits” review of the findings of Icac. The decision of the NSW court of appeal was split 2-1. The dissenting judgment of the president of the court of appeal held that the report was beyond power and that the findings of Icac should be quashed. Serving the people of NSW was an honour and privilege which I never took for granted. I always worked my hardest to look after the welfare and interests of the people of NSW. Berejiklian had argued the finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was invalid because the commissioner, Ruth McColl, was no longer at Icac when the findings were handed down. The decision, handed down earlier today, was split two to one by the three judges presiding over the case. The NSW chief justice, Andrew Bell, and Justice Anthony Meagher rejected the judicial review on all grounds, finding McColl handing down the findings while she was no longer at the commission was valid. In a dissenting judgement, Justice Julie Ward found McColl had made findings she did “not have the power to make”, and on those grounds would quash the findings of “serious corrupt conduct”. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting thunderstorms through the southern interior of Queensland this afternoon and evening: Family ‘heartbroken’ after Australian’s death in Thailand The family of an Australian man who died in Thailand has released a statement expressing their heartbreak over losing their “beautiful, gifted, much beloved Liam”. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed on Tuesday that an Australian had died in Thailand and it was providing consular assistance to the family. Multiple outlets reported that the man was allegedly stabbed after an argument at a restaurant. The family wrote in their statement: We are heartbroken at the loss of our beautiful, gifted, much beloved Liam. The world is a poorer place for his passing. Thanks to family, friends and colleagues for their support. We requested that all family members be allowed to mourn Liam’s passing in private. Financial Review reporter speaks to ABC as strike kicks off Hannah Wootton, a reporter with the Australian Financial Review, is speaking with ABC TV amid the Nine Network strike. Asked where negotiations went last night, she said they “fell down on a couple of fronts” – mainly the need for a pay rise amid inflation. We have had real pay cuts for quite a few years now. We took a 0% pay rises during the pandemic to help the company, this year it’s a cost-of-living crisis – we really wanted and needed 4%. And the company just wouldn’t come to the table on that despite publishing been profitable, despite last year they reported profits of about $150m after tax, and they just wouldn’t do it for us… Our papers more profitable than the New York Times. We do a lot with not much, and now they are saying they want to cut that even more. Wootton said there was agreement around AI consultation, and a middle ground was reached on improving diversity in the newsroom – as well as working towards better conditions for freelancers. When will staff return to the negotiating table? Wootton replied: “When they’ve got an offer for us that matches inflation.” Boy, 14, to face Adelaide court on terrorism charges Counter-terrorism detectives have charged a 14-year-old boy in Adelaide after seizing explosives instructions and extremist material, AAP reports. South Australian police said the counter-terrorism and security section had arrested the boy, who was charged with possessing explosives instructions, information for terrorist acts and extremist material. He was refused police bail to appear in the Adelaide youth court today. It is an offence in South Australia to possess extremist material and instructions on explosives. Material that directly or indirectly encourages, glorifies, promotes or condones terrorist acts, or seeks support for or justifies the carrying out of terrorist acts, is considered to be extremist material. Anyone who has information on the possession, production or distribution of extremist material can report it to the national security hotline or Crime Stoppers. It’s just gone past 11am not too long ago, and staff at the Nine Network have begun their walkout: Nine’s newspaper journalists are going on strike from 11am today following a pay dispute with management. Broede Carmody, a state political reporter at the Age newspaper, told ABC RN earlier that the anger among members was “white hot” amid job cuts and he was “not ruling out us taking further action going forward”. Surgeries at Australian hospitals could be cancelled as soon as next week due to an “unprecedented” shortage of intravenous fluids, AAP reports. Australian Medical Association president Prof Steve Robson warned supply concerns in all states and territories could have bigger implications than Covid-19 restrictions. Manufacturing issues and unexpected increases in demand are behind the global shortage of multiple intravenous fluid products, according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Several state health departments have warned of supply disruptions, including NSW Health, which issued a safety alert over critical shortages that could last two or three weeks from mid-July. Robson said imminent shortages from next week flagged by local health authorities were yet to be experienced, but they could have huge implications across the health sector. The health system potentially could come to a grinding halt next week if intravenous fluid isn’t available. The surgeon said he was scheduled to perform procedures next week but they would not go ahead if he did not have intravenous fluids. That would affect every surgeon, every anaesthetist and every patient awaiting surgery in the country. That has potentially bigger implications than the Covid restrictions. If any of your colleagues are looking a little bleary-eyed this morning, they were probably up early – or late? – watching the Matildas’ first match as part of the Paris Olympics. Bleary-eyed because the match began at 3am AEST, but also because the team were defeated 3-0 by Germany. But all hope isn’t lost, as Kieran Pender writes from Marseille: And so the Matildas find themselves in a familiar position. Backs against the wall. Never say die, and all that. The good news is it is early days in France, with two group stage matches remaining. Plenty of time, in other words, for Gustavsson and his players to turn things around. You can read his full piece below: More on the outcome of Berejiklian’s legal challenge The outcome of former NSW premier Gladys Berejikilian’s legal challenge was split two to one by the three justices presiding over the judicial review. Andrew Bell, the NSW chief justice, who read out the brief orders a short moment ago, said Justice Julie Ward took a different view on ground one of the amended summons. Bell said he would publish Ward’s view, with the written judgment due later today. Berejikilian’s legal challenge was dismissed with costs. Man arrested after allegedly stripping naked on domestic flight A Western Australian man will face court today after allegedly stripping naked and assaulting a crew member on a domestic flight to Melbourne. The 32-year-old was arrested at Perth domestic airport on 27 May after airline staff notified the Australian federal police a passenger had allegedly removed their clothing and assaulted a crew member on the flight. The man was allegedly restrained by members of the crew and the flight was forced to return to Perth airport. AFP said its officers boarded the plane and spoke to the man, who was then escorted off the plane and arrested before being taken for a mental health assessment. The man was charged via summons with one count of assault and one count of offensive/disorderly behaviour on an aircraft. The former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has lost her legal challenge against an anti-corruption watchdog finding that she engaged in “serious corrupt conduct”. Berejiklian had argued the finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was invalid because the commissioner was no longer at Icac when the findings were handed down. Berejiklian filed a summons for judicial review in the NSW court of appeal in September. A judicial review, unlike an appeal, is limited to legal missteps and cannot involve challenging the findings of fact. Weather outlook points to soggy spring in the east, dry in the west There’s been a bit of chatter about whether a La Nina will form later this year in the Pacific, making it four years out of five. The event typically brings wetter than average rainfall for much of Australia, particularly in the east. While climate models mostly point to an La Nina forming, the Bureau of Meteorology’s own model (Access S2) places more likelihood on neutral conditions. The bureau’s long-range weather forecasts, though, are probably what we should watch more closely. The latest updates for spring and for September-November point to the odds favouring wetter than usual conditions for much of the east. (The leeside of the Great Dividing Range - where most of those in, say, NSW live - should see rainfall “within the typical range”.) The west, though, tilts the other way to a drier than usual stint: There’s much less variation for temperatures, whether for maximums or minimums. And that applies to both the coming three months, and for spring itself. To be sure, these are the general forecasts. As the bureau notes, “periods of cold weather are still possible”, as are dry or wet spells for regions where conditions are currently looking at relatively wet or dry months. Murder charge laid but no sign of missing Melbourne man’s body Police have charged a man with murder after the disappearance of Adrian Romeo, who vanished five months ago and whose body is yet to be located despite an extensive search, AAP reports. Romeo, 43, has not been seen since 10 February, when he told his parents he was going to Greenvale, in Melbourne’s north, to visit friends. His phone and bank cards have not been used since then and police are yet to find a 2004 gold Toyota Camry he was driving. A 58-year-old man has been charged with murder and will face Melbourne magistrates court today. Police arrested him at a Wallan address, just north of Melbourne, about 7.20pm yesterday. The charge follows a search of a Greenvale property involving the dog squad, major crime scene investigators, the State Emergency Service, the Australian federal police’s specialist forensic search team and NSW police cadaver dogs. Anyone with information about the vehicle or Romeo’s whereabouts is urged to contact police. Nine Network newspaper journalists will go on strike from 11am this morning following a pay dispute with management. Broede Carmody, a state political reporter at the Age newspaper, spoke to ABC RN earlier this morning and said the “overwhelming majority” of members voted to take action and hundreds are due to walk out. Carmody said they were “seeking a fair pay rise that’s in line with inflation”, plus protections from AI and greater diversity measures in the newsroom. The company announced it would rip out up to 90 jobs out of our newsrooms. It’s an awful, awful situation. Carmody noted that the roughly 20 staff currently in Paris for the Olympics were not exempt from the strike action and while it was difficult for them on “the trip of a lifetime”, “what we’re fighting for is really important.” There’s just too much at stake. As to what the paper will look like over the coming days, I think people will see that you can’t put out a proper high-quality newspaper … without really talented journalists. Carmody said the anger among members was “white hot” amid job cuts, and he was “not ruling out us taking further action going forward”. It’s the worst that I’ve seen the anger … We took a 0% pay rise during the pandemic to help the company out when everyone else was shedding jobs, and it was really uncertain times. It’s time for the company to help us. Queensland corruption watchdog paid $441k in ex-public trustee’s legal bills Queensland’s Crime and Corruption Commission paid $440,806 in legal bills after a precedent-setting legal case by former public trustee Peter Carne. But it has yet to agree how much to pay the lawyers of former deputy premier Jacquie Trad. CCC chairperson Bruce Barbour revealed the organisation’s huge legal bill in a parliamentary estimates hearing this morning. Barbour said the CCC’s own legal bill totalled nearly a million dollars for defending the Carne case, and $91,000 on the Trad case. Both Carne and Trad challenged the right of the CCC to release reports which were critical of a public figure but which did not recommend “prosecution proceedings or disciplinary action” or after a public hearing. The CCC took the matter all the way to the high court, where Carne ultimately prevailed last September. The judgment also applies to Trad. This post was amended on 26 July 2024 to change the figure in the first paragraph after Barbour told parliamentary estimates he had made an error about the costs. What kind of leader do voters want in these chaotic times? After weeks of chaos on the campaign trail, the new Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, has brought some voters fresh enthusiasm for the US presidential election. But will this early bump propel Harris to the White House? Progressive leaders around the world have countered the chaos of conservatives by projecting calm and by running sensible, risk-averse campaigns. In today’s episode of the Full Story podcast, Bridie Jabour speaks to Guardian Australia’s editor-in-chief, Lenore Taylor, national news editor, Josephine Tovey, and head of news, Mike Ticher, about the politics of being sensible and what voters really want in their leader. You can have a listen below: The bombshell ruling that made it impossible for Australia to delay sanctions against Israeli settlers While much of the Australian media were focused on the latest twists in the US presidential election, the international court of justice (ICJ) delivered sweeping findings against Israel’s conduct in the occupied Palestinian territories, ratcheting up pressure on all governments to take a firmer line. The ICJ ruling comes at a time of significant legal peril for the Israeli government over the way it has conducted its military response to Hamas’s 7 October attacks. In a separate and ongoing case, the ICJ is weighing up South Africa’s allegations that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. Additionally, the international criminal court will soon decide whether to issue arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defence minister (along with three Hamas leaders) for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes. These are significant accusations and the Israeli government denies them all. In some ways, however, the latest advisory opinion from the ICJ regarding the 57-year-long occupation of territories it seized in 1967, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has the potential to have the biggest impact. In case you missed our full analysis overnight, you can continue reading below: As expected, the 21-country World Heritage committee has decided overnight the Great Barrier Reef will not be placed on a list of sites in danger. The committee, currently meeting in India, accepted a set of draft recommendations from Unesco and the International Union for Conservation of Nature that were published last month. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the decision was a “huge win” for Queensland and the thousands of people who relied on it for their work “and a huge win for all the plants and animals that call it home”. Australia was urged by the committee to set more ambitious climate targets and expressed “high concern” at rates of land clearing in catchments flowing into the reef. Australia will need to submit a progress report by February next year and the committee said it could consider the reef for inclusion on the “in danger” list at its 2026 meeting. The committee has for years been expressing concern at the impacts on the reef from global heating, poor water quality and fishing. No World Heritage site has ever been placed on the “in danger” list because of climate change impacts. The NSW government has granted extended trading hours to licensed venues showing major events live from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, AAP reports. Hotels, bars, clubs, small bars and live music venues could trade until the early morning if they screen Olympics Matildas games or the swimming finals, the government has said. With an eight-hour time difference between Paris and Sydney, the extended trading will give more fans the chance to cheer on their favourite athletes and teams. The special trading hours encouraged a vibrant nightlife for residents and tourists, minister for the night-time economy John Graham said. He said eligible venues did not need to apply individually to open when they screened the Olympics coverage. India charges man for allegedly sexually abusing WA girl, 11, via social media A man has been charged by Indian authorities after allegedly sexually abusing and intimidating a girl from Western Australia through social media, starting when she was 11. WA police said detectives were notified in 2023 of allegations involving an 11-year-old girl in 2020 and that she was the victim of online grooming, sextortion and other online offences from a person she met online. Police allege the abuse continued over several years and “caused severe trauma to the girl”. Detectives determined the alleged offender resided in India and referred the matter to Indian authorities, who arrested and charged a man from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, with criminal intimidation, transmitting material depicting children in a sexually explicit act, and sexual harassment upon a child with sexual intent. India’s Central Bureau of Investigation used geolocation techniques to track the man and execute a search warrant, where they seized incriminating materials, WA police said. It is understood the matter is still going through the Indian court system. Violence against women has declined significantly in the past three decades, AAP reports, but experts warn there is still a long way to go. The latest report card from Our Watch, a leading national organisation in the prevention of violence against women, showed there had been a 66% drop in the number of women killed by men in the past 30 years. The number of young men supporting harmful ideas of masculinity had fallen by 13% since 2018. But the trends came against the backdrop of an increase in the number of women killed by men this year. While the findings were welcome, more work needed to be done, the organisation’s chief executive, Patty Kinnersly, said. In a year where 42 women have [allegedly] been killed by men’s violence, it’s difficult to reconcile we are making progress in ending this national crisis. But when we look at the longer-term picture, we can see significant reductions in the number of women killed by men’s violence, reductions in women experiencing violence and improvements in community attitudes that reject and challenge this violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732), Lifeline 13 11 14 Linda Burney is asked when she realised the voice referendum wasn’t going to be a success. Burney said she held on to hope until the last minute, but historically referendums had always relied on bipartisan support – which was not reached – and “that made things much, much more difficult”. I wouldn’t say it was cooked from the start … 6.5 million Australians voted yes, in Aboriginal communities they voted 80-90% yes, and the most fabulous thing is that we’ve got a group of young Aboriginal people who’ve had a fire lit in their belly and they will take things forward. Q: Will Malarndirri McCarthy, the assistant minister for Indigenous Australians, replace you? Linda Burney said that was “way above [her] pay grade” but that McCarthy was a dear friend: The most important thing is for me to support whoever it is in the role and to give them the space to be able to chart their own path … Aboriginal affairs is every minister’s responsibility, not just the minister for Indigenous Australians. Burney reflects on career after resigning from politics The outgoing minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, is now speaking with ABC RN after announcing she would retire from politics. She said she would miss the camaraderie of her colleagues, the “fact you can affect lives and make the world a little bit better”, and the thousands of First Nations people she has met throughout her career. Asked what she hoped her legacy will be, Burney replied she wanted to be remembered for her “grace and integrity”. Burney said she didn’t want the voice referendum debate to turn into a “he said she said” and despite the outcome not being what she had hoped for, “we did move forward with the public discussion”. The outgoing minister said she would be “lying” if she said some of the public discussion during the debate wasn’t hurtful, but she chose not to engage with it because the “broader objective” was more important. Burney said she had no regrets and saw “such wonderful leadership in the Aboriginal community” and it was time “to give the new minister the space they need to chart their own way”. My job is to support that person as much as I can. MPs quizzed on ministerial reshuffle Labor MPs are being questioned about Sunday’s ministerial reshuffle on breakfast television this morning. As the prime minister announced yesterday, he will unveil a reshuffled ministry on Sunday after Linda Burney and Brendan O’Connor announced their retirement from politics: NDIS minister Bill Shorten made his regular Friday appearance on the Today Show just a moment ago, and suggested he didn’t expect too many changes. We will [have] to wait and see. I am not expecting a lot, but having said that, I guess we will wait and see. We will find out soon enough. Only three more sleeps. Education minister Jason Clare was on Sunrise and said: “I haven’t heard anything.” Meanwhile, Liberal MP Sussan Ley, the shadow minister for skills and training opposite O’Connor, wished both him and Burney well. It’s absolutely the prime minister’s decision and when he makes it, everybody finds out, including the nation. Road safety alert issued as fog coats Brisbane this morning The Bureau of Meteorology has warned of fog across Brisbane this morning, reducing visibility and making road conditions dangerous. Journalists from the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday will down tools at 11am today after crisis talks yesterday failed to stop a strike at Nine Entertainment’s mastheads. Rallies are planned outside the newsrooms of Nine Entertainment across the country, where union membership is as high as 90%. The industrial action will include the 20 journalists who travelled to Paris for the Olympic Games and who will now have to sit out the opening ceremony and the opening weekend. Management insists its coverage across all platforms will be unaffected. TV staff are not unionised so the broadcasting of the games, for which Nine has the $100m broadcasting rights, is not impacted. The media union said journalists were taking a stand for ethical journalism and wages that keep up with the cost of living. More on the call to release robodebt report’s ‘sealed’ chapter Continuing from our last post: It means now the Nacc’s inquiry has ended, and at least one AFP investigation has been finalised, the only remaining known investigations lie within a special public service taskforce investigating the actions of 16 bureaucrats. In an update at Senate estimates hearings in May, the Australian public service commissioner, Gordon de Brouwer, said one of the 16 people “did not meet the threshold to issue a notice of suspected breach”. Seven final determinations – meaning a finding – had been given and another seven were still under way. The final outcomes are expected to be made public in the coming months. But the Greens’ social and government services spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said it was now time for those pages to be revealed publicly: The illegal Robodebt scheme saw thousands of innocent people pursued like criminals, yet the members of parliament and senior department officials responsible for this injustice have never been held accountable. And while the victims of the scheme still wait for justice, many of those same people are still trapped in a broken and punitive social security system where aggressive debt recovery practices continue and for-profit job providers can suspend payments on a whim. It’s been more than 12 months since the royal commission handed down its findings and we still don’t know who the commissioner referred for civil and criminal prosecution, despite minister Shorten saying that keeping this information secret was “not sustainable”. We can’t allow this to get swept under the carpet and lost to history. The chapter must be unsealed and those responsible for so much death, pain and loss must face the consequences of their actions. Greens call for ‘sealed’ chapter of robodebt inquiry report to be made public A “sealed” chapter of the robodebt royal commission’s final report, containing the names of individuals referred to integrity bodies and the police “for civil action or criminal prosecution”, should be urgently made public, the Greens say. It comes as the Australian federal police revealed on Wednesday it had finalised an investigation into allegations a witness gave false evidence in a hearing. The AFP said it did not find “sufficient admissible evidence” that the alleged offender had intended to mislead. The final report, released last July, concluded the robodebt scheme was “crude and cruel”, a “costly failure of public administration” and “neither fair nor legal”. Upon the final report’s release, commissioner Catherine Holmes recommended an additional chapter “remain sealed and not be tabled with the rest of the report so as not to prejudice the conduct of any future civil action or criminal prosecution”. At the time, the government services minister, Bill Shorten, said it was not a “sustainable position” to keep the chapter a secret forever. He added he didn’t believe Holmes’ directions on the sealed chapter implied a “forever situation”. In June, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) announced it was no longer investigating the six individuals referred to the new body, saying it was “unlikely it would obtain significant new evidence” because of a separate public service investigation simultaneously under way. And happy Friday – thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our live coverage today. Feel free to get in touch with any thoughts, tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let’s get started. The former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian is expected to learn later this morning whether she has succeeded in her legal challenge to findings made against her by the anti-corruption watchdog. Berejiklian filed a summons for judicial review in the NSW court of appeal last September. She argued that Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) findings that she engaged in serious corrupt conduct were invalid because the assistant commissioner in charge of the investigation was no longer at the commission when the findings were finalised. Andrew Bell, the NSW chief justice, is expected to hand down his judgment in the case at 10.15am. He is only expected to read out brief orders, before a written judgment is published later on Friday. Icac had initially been investigating former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire, who was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct. Maguire was alleged to have used his position to conduct a business helping property developers. After Berejiklian was heard on phone taps, she was called to give evidence at Icac and admitted she had been in a “close personal relationship” with Maguire for several years, which she had not disclosed to colleagues or family. Icac then investigated a number of grants she had been involved in approving for Wagga Wagga as well as her state of knowledge of Maguire’s business dealings. Berejiklian has maintained she served the public interest “at all times” while in office. The court heard in February that lawyers for Berejiklian argued that viewing a relationship as a “standing potential for impropriety” is a “black, depressing and utterly unrealistic view of human life”. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be flagging some of the best overnight stories before Emily Wind takes over. Linda Burney has been praised for her “courage” and “dedication” after she resigned as minister for Indigenous Australians. She tells our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, that her successor must “listen to people, allow people to get to know you and, most importantly, bring people with you”. Meanwhile, our political editor, Karen Middleton, looks at the challenges for Anthony Albanese as he tries to find a replacement for her and outgoing skills minister Brendan O’Connor. Journalists employed by Nine Entertainment’s publishing division have voted overwhelmingly to strike over pay from Friday for five days, hampering the company’s coverage of the Paris Olympic Games due to officially begin overnight, Australian time. Nine is the official broadcaster of the 2024 games, paying $100m for the broadcast rights for this year alone. The stop work action starts at 11am today and includes all newspaper staff covering the Games in Paris, but not television. Gladys Berejiklian’s fight to clear her name of serious corruption findings will be decided in a court of appeal ruling for her and the NSW integrity watchdog. Chief Justice Andrew Bell will deliver his decision today as the former NSW premier fights findings she breached public trust through her covert romance with disgraced party colleague Daryl Maguire. We’ll have all the details as they unfold."

                    "bodyText": "Even though computers were made to do maths faster than any human could manage, the top level of formal mathematics remains an exclusively human domain. But a breakthrough by researchers at Google DeepMind has brought AI systems closer than ever to beating the best human mathematicians at their own game. A pair of new systems, called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, worked together to tackle questions from the International Mathematical Olympiad, a global maths competition for secondary-school students that has been running since 1959. The Olympiad takes the form of six mind-bogglingly hard questions each year, covering fields including algebra, geometry and number theory. Winning a gold medal places you among the best handful of young mathematicians in the world. The combined efforts of DeepMind’s two systems weren’t quite in that league. After their answers were marked by Prof Timothy Gowers – a winner of the mathematics equivalent to the Nobel prize, the Fields medal, and a gold medalist in the olympiad himself – the DeepMind team scored 28 out of 42 – enough for a silver medal, but one point short of gold. Unlike a human mathematician, the systems were either flawless or hopeless. In each of the questions they solved, they scored perfect marks, but for two out of the six questions, they were unable to even begin working towards an answer. Moreover, DeepMind, unlike humancompetitors, was given no time limit. While students get nine hours to tackle the problems, the DeepMind systems took three days working round the clock to solve one question, despite blitzing another in seconds. The two systems that worked on the challenge were very different from each other. AlphaProof, which solved three of the problems, works by pairing a large language model – of the sort applied in consumer chatbots – with a specialist “reinforcement learning” approach, like that used by DeepMind to tackle the board game Go. The trick is in leveraging a pre-existing approach called “formal mathematics”, a set of rules that lets you write a mathematical proof as a program that can run only if it is true. “What we try to do is to build a bridge between these two spheres,” said Thomas Hubert, the lead on AlphaProof, “so that we can take advantage of the guarantees that come with formal mathematics and the data that is available in informal mathematics.” After it was trained on a vast number of maths problems written in English, AlphaProof used its knowledge to try to generate specific proofs in the formal language. Because those proofs can be verifiably true or not, it is possible to teach the system to improve itself. The approach can solve difficult problems, but isn’t always fast at doing so: while it is far better than simple trial and error, it took three days to find the correct formal model for one of the hardest questions in the challenge. The other system, AlphaGeometry 2, similarly pairs a language model with a more mathematically inclined approach. But its success at the narrower field of geometry problems was startling: it solved its problem in just 16 seconds. And, Gowers says, chose a surprising route to do so. “There have been some legendary examples of [computer-aided] proofs that are longer than Wikipedia. This was not that: we’re talking about a very short, human-style output.” The lead on AlphaGeometry 2, Thang Luong, described the output as similar to the famous “move 37” in DeepMind’s historic victory at Go, when the AI system made a move no human would have thought of, and went on to win. AlphaGeometry 2’s proof involved constructing a circle around another point, and then using that circle to prove the overall answer. “At first, our expert didn’t quite understand why it constructed that point at all,” said Luong. “But after looking at the solution, it really connects many triangles together, and they thought that the solution was really quite elegant.” AlphaGeometry 2’s easiest question … Let ABC be a triangle with AB &lt; AC &lt; BC. Let the incentre and incircle of triangle ABC be I and ω, respectively. Let X be the point on line BC different from C such that the line through X parallel to AC is tangent to ω. Similarly, let Y be the point on line BC different from B such that the line through Y parallel to AB is tangent to ω. Let AI intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC again at P ≠ A. Let K and L be the midpoints of AC and AB, respectively. Prove that ∠KIL + ∠YPX = 180◦. Solved in 19 seconds. … and AlphaProof’s hardest one Turbo the snail plays a game on a board with 2024 rows and 2023 columns. There are hidden monsters in 2022 of the cells. Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters are, but he knows that there is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last row, and that each column contains at most one monster. Turbo makes a series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing a common side. (He is allowed to return to a previously visited cell.) If he reaches a cell with a monster, his attempt ends and he is transported back to the first row to start a new attempt. The monsters do not move, and Turbo remembers whether or not each cell he has visited contains a monster. If he reaches any cell in the last row, his attempt ends and the game is over. Determine the minimum value of n for which Turbo has a strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on the nth attempt or earlier, regardless of the locations of the monsters. Unsolved."

                    "bodyText": "Almost two-thirds of British jobs could be “enhanced” with AI, Google has claimed, with only a tiny proportion at risk of being “phased out” entirely. Instead of worrying about job losses caused by AI, the focus needed to be on making sure the millions of Britons who could work in smarter and faster ways with AI tech got the support to use it, the company said. “Fewer than 50% of people are actually taking advantage of these tools in their working life on a day to day basis,” said Debbie Weinstein, managing director of Google UK. “The uptake of these tools is very low, and I think the only way we’re going to unlock the potential of what AI can do is actually by getting people to use them, and to feel confident and capable about them.” According to research from the thinktank Public First, commissioned by Google, 61% of British jobs will be “radically” transformed by AI, with just 31% “insulated” from the technology – defined as having fewer than a quarter of their workplace tasks with the potential to be automated. Those insulated jobs would overwhelmingly be in social care, transport, accommodation and food services, where complex and varied physical tasks were achievable only by human workers, Public First said. Just a handful of jobs were likely to be fully “phased out” by the introduction of AI, the thinktank estimated. Even the most affected sector, financial and insurance, is forecast to lose just 4% of jobs, with 83% “enhanced” instead. Public First’s findings are similar to recent research from the Tony Blair Institute. The thinktank drew up its estimates by using an AI model “to classify over 17,000 types of work tasks by the potential for generative AI to either significantly reduce the time taken to do them, or automate them entirely”. Given the research, Google is partnering with the Community union, the small-business network Enterprise Nation, and a pair of multi-academy trusts to try to crack how best to introduce AI technology into typical workplaces in a way that boosts workers’ abilities rather than replaces them. Weinstein said: “Part of what’s tricky about us talking about it now is that we actually don’t know exactly what’s going to transpire. What we do know is the first step is going to be sitting down [with the partners] and really understanding the use cases. If it’s school administrators versus people in the classroom, what are the particular tasks we actually want to get after for these folks? “If you are a school teacher some of it might be a simple email with ideas about how to use Gemini in lesson planning, some of it might be formal classroom training, some of it one on one coaching. Across 1,200 people there will be a lot of different pilots, each group with around 100 people.” The government backs the trial, with Minister for AI, Feryal Clark MP, saying: “Speeding up the diffusion of AI throughout our economy will be key to kickstarting growth, transforming our public services, and delivering new opportunities for working people across the country. Just as important, is making sure we bring people along with us and build a workforce which is fit for the future by delivering the AI skills training which will help careers to flourish and businesses to grow – this will help us do just that.” Public First estimates potential gains of more than £400bn for the UK economy if AI were adopted to its fullest over the next six years, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 2.6% from the technology alone. It says that 100 hours a year could be saved by the average British worker using generative AI, a gain which, Google claims, is the biggest improvement to worker productivity “since the arrival of Google Search”. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, on Tuesday reported surging profits and revenues, as well as a $70bn stock buyback. Its AI exploits this year came under scrutiny when it botched the rollout of its Gemini AI image-generator tool, which led to investor fears about its investments in artificial intelligence products. However, it doubled down on showcasing its investments in AI during its annual developers’ conference in May. Among the AI-related features and tools it debuted was an attempt to overhaul Google Search through the widespread release of AI Overviews, short pieces of text that summarise articles and search results. AI Overviews have faced heavy criticism, including from publishers who argue that it will reduce traffic to their own sites."

                    "bodyText": "Wall Street suffered its worst day of trading in 19 months as disappointment around earnings from Tesla and Google challenged the recent big-tech rally. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index dropped 2.3% as a sell-off triggered its biggest single-day fall since December 2022. The technology-focused Nasdaq retreated 3.6%, its largest single-day decline since October 2022. Shares in Tesla sank 12% after it reported a 45% slump in quarterly profits amid discounting by electric carmakers. Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, also fell 5% as investors scrutinized a slowdown in advertising growth. The two companies were the first out of the gate as America’s tech giants update shareholders on their recent performance. Over the coming weeks, the rest of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech heavyweights – Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; Apple; Nvidia; Microsoft; and Amazon – are set to follow. “I can’t help thinking [that] if the tech sector does sneeze, the whole market could catch it,” said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: “Whilst Alphabet’s news wasn’t awful, the fact they’re still ploughing billions into [artificial intelligence] has caused some to begin questioning when enough will be enough, or at least when the expenditure will deliver the kind of results investors have been salivating over elsewhere in the AI space. “Elon Musk’s attempts to get investors to look anywhere but at the bottom line has also backfired. Even if Tesla’s CEO insists the company isn’t just a carmaker, until robots or robo-taxis start to make money, EVs are the only game in Tesla town, and margins have been wrung out.” Reuters contributed reporting"
