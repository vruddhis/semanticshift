          "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves’s enthusiasm for the City of London – the “crown jewel in our economy” – raises concerns. Economists were worried enough to publicly warn her this month that liberalising financial sector regulations could undermine the government’s efforts to grow the economy, posing “particular risks to the government’s wider industrial strategy”. They also stressed the importance of not forgetting the painful lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis. The experts were responding to the chancellor’s November Mansion House speech, in which Ms Reeves suggested that post-crisis regulations have “gone too far”. This is a troubling statement. Those rules were implemented to curb the sector’s excesses, prevent systemic risks and ensure that the Treasury does not have to bail out its failures. Rolling back such measures in the name of economic growth ignores the stability and protection they’ve provided. The crux of Ms Reeves’s argument is that expanding the sector will increase and broaden economic prosperity. History offers little support for such claims. The financial sector accounts for 9% of GDP, and the chancellor highlighted its success as the second-largest exporter of financial services in the G7. But it has done little to address the UK’s stagnant productivity or its chronic underinvestment. Rather the sector’s rise has come at the expense of the “real economy” by siphoning off resources and talent. About a million people are employed in financial services. Compare that to roughly 20 million adults in England and Wales classed as manual workers, or the 15 million who work in low-paid, white-collar positions. In the squeezed bottom and middle, pay and social mobility are stagnant. It would be better to promote labour-intensive industries that have long been neglected. Instead of further deregulation, Britain’s financial sector should return to directing productive investment. Once a tool for economic development, the sector is increasingly detached from its original purpose. The thinktank Positive Money pointed out that in 1960 the assets of UK banks were equivalent to 32% of GDP; by 2022 this figure had jumped to 563%. It highlighted international evidence that “too much finance is robustly found to harm growth”. The financialisation of the UK economy has contributed to inequality and instability. In housing, an asset bubble means average-priced English homes are affordable only to the richest 10%. There is a danger to the wider economy when speculators ditch caution and chase higher risks. Insiders are sounding alarms. Sir John Kay’s 2015 book Other People’s Money questioned the wisdom of a culture where morality and prudence are subordinate to personal profit. The Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, told MPs in December that loosening the regulator’s remit will let more bad actors through. A few months earlier, the Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, had drawn on Greek mythology to make a point about the need to be vigilant over financial services’ excess. He thought the Trojan princess Cassandra, doomed to deliver true but ignored prophecies, might have made a good central banker. Her warnings, said Mr Bailey, chime with the economist Hyman Minsky’s view that memories of crises fade, only to be replaced by illusions of a “new era”. The global financial crisis of 2008 feels distant. But complacency is the real danger. If the chancellor refuses to learn from history, Britain is likely to suffer the same mistakes again.

An earlier version said that there were 25 million working-age UK adults classed as manual workers, and 10 million who work in low-paid, white-collar positions. In fact, latest ONS figures show there were roughly 20 million working-age adults in England and Wales classed as manual workers, and 15 million who work in low-paid, white-collar positions."

          "bodyText": "You can serve these in one of two ways: three scallops, each in large half-shells or small ramekins as a dinner party starter, or if you are lucky enough to have 18 small shells, serve them as canapes – my daughter appropriated my collection into her toy kitchen, so I had to beg for them back: “I’m making fish fingers in a shell!” She didn’t buy it. For anyone who isn’t a toddler, these are a lovely, easy, prep-ahead dish. Scallop, leek and mushroom gratins Make the sauce and breadcrumb topping the day before, then reheat the sauce and cook the scallops just before assembling and flashing everything under the grill. Prep 15 min Cook 30 min Serves 6 as a starter 2 tbsp olive oil 15g salted butter 1 large leek, trimmed, tough outer leaves peeled off and discarded, the rest finely sliced (about 200g) 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated 150g mixed wild mushrooms, roughly chopped 1 tsp sea salt flakes 100ml dry white wine 3 heaped tbsp cream cheese 18 queen scallops Black pepper 15g grated parmesan 15g panko breadcrumbs 15g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped ½ tsp chilli flakes (optional) Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil and all the butter in a large frying pan on a low heat and, when the butter starts foaming, stir in the leeks and garlic, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until softened – you don’t want the leeks to take on any colour. Add the mushrooms and salt, and fry for five to six minutes more, until the mushrooms are soft and cooked through. Add the wine, leave to bubble down until the liquid is barely clinging to the mushrooms, then stir in the cream cheese. Add the scallops, turn up the heat to medium-high and cook for two minutes per side, until just cooked through. Turn off the heat, stir through some black pepper, then taste the sauce and adjust for salt as needed. Heat the grill to high (mine reads 200C). Mix the remaining tablespoon of oil with the parmesan, breadcrumbs, parsley and chilli, if using. Divide the scallop and mushroom mix evenly between scallop half-shells or ramekins, and top each one with some of the breadcrumb mix. Flash under the grill for two to three minutes, until the topping is golden brown, then serve immediately."

          "bodyText": "Will 2024 really be remembered for brat, brain rot and AI-generated slop? Judging by the Filter recommendations you loved the most, it’s actually been the year of heated blankets, book lights and big coats. An altogether more cuddly vibe. It makes perfect sense. When times are toxic, you reach for comfort. You’ve already had your fill of Trump, Musk and Baby Reindeer – not to mention rain, rising bills and the relentless horror of global news – so you’re craving a psychological detox. Finding joy in autumn’s best beauty buys and money-saving products that make life easier is a way of giving your mood a hug. When we crunched the sales data for more than 350 of the products we tested and recommended in 2024, self-soothing emerged as the clear theme. Thermals, pyjamas and a peacoat all featured in the top 20. So did a couple of products designed to feather your nest (a Ninja air fryer and Sage’s gorgeous Bambino coffee machine), and there was even a foam seat pad to comfort your bottom while camping. Excellent work, readers. We couldn’t have created a better collective antidote to the year of floods and algorithmic junk if we’d tried. Here are the 10 items you loved the most. *** The Thermos that keeps you in hot lunches Thermos food flask, £18.75 amazon.co.uk The classic chunky Thermos delivers all we’ve desired in 2024: hot food, hot food right now, and hot food right now that doesn’t cost a bomb. It’s also fabulous value, so it’s no surprise that you bought it in droves after the Filter’s editor Hannah Booth mentioned it in everyday products that make life easier. *** The heated throw to cut your bills Dreamland Hurry Home heated throw, £94.99 johnlewis.com Another everyday product that makes life easier, this toasty soft blanket is the smartest way to get warm. Wear it while you WFH, bury yourself under it while trying to escape the real world – and use it instead of putting on the radiators. It could even pay for itself by shaving pounds off your heating bills (see below for our more recent test). *** The pampering body stick The Inkey List body stick, £15 theinkeylist.com This deodorant-style glycolic body stick was the most popular of all our best beauty buys. It’s a great price, easy to use, and wonderfully soothing on rough patches and body spots. *** The pillow spray to soothe you to sleep This Works pillow spray, £20 thisworks.com A calming fragrance is one of the best triggers for good-quality sleep, as said sport sleep coach Nick Littlehales when recommending this clinically tested pillow spray in 16 affordable essentials. You loved the lavender edition so much that it’s sold out, but many other varieties will help you sleep that bit better in 2025. *** The best socks on the high street Heattech socks, £7.90 uniqlo.com Heattech socks are much more than a pretty pair of feet: they trap heat, absorb moisture and control odours, and they’re wonderfully comfortable. You know all this already, judging by how many of you bought these fabulous cable-knit socks after we featured them in our best Christmas gifts of 2024. *** The heated airer that dries your laundry – and warms the room Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe heated airer, £249.99 lakeland.co.uk This was my favourite of all the heated clothes airers I tested as autumn turned to winter, around the time Trump claimed victory. Boy, did this thing cheer me up. It’s pricey to buy but so cheap to run that I was happy to leave it on all day, and as well as drying my smalls with aplomb it gently warmed whatever room I used it in. A smart buy, especially if 2025’s weather is as wet as 2024’s. *** The scarf coat John Lewis Anyday crop scarf coat, £69 johnlewis.com A whole new coat! The year may have delivered some bad things but fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley found the ultimate antidote in the rise of the scarf coat, which, if nothing else, will prevent you from forgetting your scarf on a chilly day. You were particularly keen on this boxy version from John Lewis, which is excellent value at £69. *** The knee pillow that could save your sleep Ergonomic knee pillow, £17.95 amazon.co.uk A “gamechanger” for a side sleeper who’s fed up with trying to jigsaw their knees into place, this memory foam knee pillow was writer Simon Usborne’s selection for everyday items that could improve your life. He credits it for keeping his “spindly” knees “cosseted and comfortably separated” in bed, and you were convinced enough to blast it into the year’s top 10. *** A life-saver when you’re up a mountain Anker power bank, £26.99 amazon.co.uk If 2024 left you wanting to flee to the woods or mountains, we don’t blame you – but please do take a battery pack so you’re not stranded with a dead phone. Anker’s power bank featured in our university essentials guide and autumn hiking roundup, and it left all our other tech recommendations for dust in the sales charts. *** The vegetable chopper that saves you time (and makes chips) Vegetable chopper and cutter, £19.99 amazon.co.uk This one’s basically a giant garlic press – and what a fabulously time-saving, hassle-reducing, kitchen-injury-avoiding little masterpiece it is. In our list of everyday products that make life easier, books editor Charlotte Northedge credited it for tempting her children into eating more fruit and veg, and says it makes “perfect chips”. Surely that’s the best cure for 2024. *** This week’s picks The best slippers for men and women, from cosy sheepskin mules to chic ballet shoes The best waterproof jackets for men: get outdoors whatever the weather with our expert-tested picks The best women’s waterproof jackets for every type of adventure, reviewed and rated Editor’s pick With the cold, icy grip of January stretching before us, can you think of anything better than cuddling up with a fluffy blanket on the sofa? No? Well, what if the blanket was heated? Saving energy may come with all sorts of financial and environmental benefits, but doing so will rarely make you feel more warm and cosy. Yet, heated throws and electric blankets are so effective at heating the person, rather than the whole house, that they can also help you save money on energy bills (although you’ll need to factor in the initial cost of the blanket, of course). Bedding expert Emily Peck tested 10 electric blankets and throws for the Filter, measuring the temperature, calculating running costs and cuddling lots of blankets to seek out peak January cosiness for as little as 2p an hour.

          "bodyText": "As Rebeca Andrade, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles stood behind the podium at the medal ceremony for the Olympic women’s gymnastics floor exercise in Paris, the significance of the moment was clear to all. Their collective success marked the first time in history that three black gymnasts had won bronze, silver and gold at the Olympic Games. And after years of pushing the greatest gymnast of all time to the limit, Brazil’s Andrade had finally outperformed Biles. In the frenetic moments between competition and ceremony, Chiles and Biles agreed that the special circumstances merited a statement. When Andrade stepped up with her arms aloft to collect the gold medal, the two Americans bowed down to the Brazilian. Andrade extended a hand to each gymnast in response. “Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well,” said Chiles after the event, meaning flowers as a metaphor for recognition. “So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. I felt like it was needed.” This was an extraordinary demonstration of sportsmanship in a Games where athletes competed with sincerity and respect throughout. Even as they tackled challenges for which they had spent their lives training, many of them still put their humanity first. During the medal ceremony for the table tennis mixed doubles, the South Korean, North Korean and Chinese medallists, initiated by Lim Jong-hoon of South Korea, did not hesitate to pose for a selfie that defied closed borders. Moments after Great Britain’s Alex Yee had flitted past him in the final stages of the men’s triathlon to win gold, Hayden Wilde of New Zealand put an arm around his opponent as he offered his congratulations. When Angola’s Albertina Kassoma badly injured her knee during a handball match, it was a rival, Brazil’s Tamires Araújo Frossard, who carried her off the court. As the Olympics unfolded, the acts of sportsmanship in the arenas seemed to reflect the host city. Paris had never felt so tranquil and wholesome, the scepticism about the event days before the opening ceremony quickly dissipating as the city united in the spectacle and the emotions. While sporting events often bring out the worst in opposing fans, supporters from around the world warmly received each other for three weeks. Still, the Olympic bubble felt artificial – a welcome escape from real life, but also a distraction at a time when it seemed as if the world was falling apart. As the Games continued in Paris, far-right thugs rioted in England and Northern Ireland, attacking ethnic minority people, targeting their businesses and inflicting terror, their rampage mirroring the rise of the far-right elsewhere. As the few Palestinian athletes present used their platforms to spotlight others’ suffering, Israel’s airstrikes and ground incursion in Gaza continued. The International Olympic Committee affirmed its neutrality, presenting the Games as if it exists in a geopolitical void. The organisers of Paris 2024 were not beyond reproach, either. Instead of using the Olympics as an opportunity to develop better conditions for the most vulnerable, the authorities swept thousands of homeless people out of view and detached them from their support networks. Even the gesture of gymnastics sportsmanship between Andrade, Biles and Chiles has been tainted. Chiles won her bronze – her first individual Olympic medal – after a dramatic climax in the floor final, with her score initially placing her fifth, behind two Romanian gymnasts, Ana Bărbosu and Sabrina Voinea, before her coach lodged an inquiry. After the review, Chiles’s difficulty score was increased by 0.1, moving her into third place. Days later, after the Romanian Gymnastics Federation (FRG) contested the result, the court of arbitration for sport concluded that Chiles’ inquiry had been logged four seconds outside the time limit of one minute. USA Gymnastics says the inquiry was lodged in good time; arguments still rage over numerous judging decisions in the final. The FRG and USA Gymnastics were happy to share the bronze, but the IOC stripped Chiles of the medal and awarded it to Bărbosu. That decision (for which USA Gymnastics has submitted an appeal to the Swiss supreme court), and the mess that has followed the floor exercise medal ceremony, seems like a perfect representation of the 2024 Olympics. So many athletes delivered their performances under suffocating pressure – and inspired with their thoughtful, sporting gestures throughout – but the organisers and structures of the Games failed to live up to the values it promotes."

          "bodyText": "Here’s Geoff’s report from the MCG. See you back here for day five! An astounding end to an extraordinary day in an amazing Test. India threw the first punch of day four, popping the bubble of new sensation Sam Konstas who got an unplayable peach from – who else? – Jasprit Bumrah and walked off for eight. With Australia’s teen talisman gone, India went on a tear before a roaring crowd that has now reached a record high of over 299,000 over the four days. Mohammed Siraj got rid of Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja before Bumrah blasted out Travis Head (1), Mitchell Marsh (0) and Alex Carey (2). At 91 for 6, Australia looked shot. But two first innings heroes came to the rescue: Marnus Labuschagne scrapped his way to another 70 and captain Pat Cummins added to his 49 with a fighting 41. The home side got to 148 before India surged back into the contest. Cummins holes out, Mitchell Starc ran himself out and Australia looked down and out at 173 for 9. Enter the unlikely 10th wicket partnmers of Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland. Through guile, luck and courage they inched Australia to a lead of 300 and then went past it. Their extraordinary 55-run partnership for the 10th wicket has Australia 333 runs ahead. And given the highest score ever chased at the MCG which was 332 back in December 1928, it puts Australia in the box seat to win this fourth Test and take a 2-1 lead into the final match in Sydney. But it ain’t over til it’s over. And this Test series has twisted and turned like few others. Will Australia’s fast bowlers roll through India tomorrow – or will the niggles to Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Marsh leave them hamstrung? Or can India mount yet another fightback and steal the Test – and the series – with a record-chasing run chase? Join us tomorrow to find out. One thing’s for sure: it’ll be a day to remember. 82nd over: Australia 228-9 (Lyon 41, Boland 10) Last ocer of the day. Who you gonna call? Jasprit Bumrah. He tosses up a fat full toss and Nathan Lyon clubs it square for FOUR. Probably the worst ball of the series by Bumrah. He’s tired and needs a hot thali and a cold Kingfisher. Bumrah errs again with a no ball and then Lyon steers a short ball through midwicket for two. And now high farce… an edge, a catch between the knees, a brief celebration and then dropped heads as the umpire calls no-ball. There goes Bumnrah’s five-for. And judt when India think it can;’t get any worse Lyon salts the wound with a whack over midwicket that brings up the fifty partnership. Remarkable. And Lyon adds an absurd full stop to an extraordinary day by edging for FOUR. Ouch! 81st over: Australia 214-9 (Lyon 29, Boland 10) India has the new ball but seems they want Jasprit Bumrah to bowl with it next over. Instead Akash Deep gets a final whirl with the old cherry which is showing hints of reverse swing. Lyon doesn’t care. He drives another single. I stand corrected. With Boland on strike India take the new ball. Boland deflects a single to third man to go into double figures. And Lyon leans into the next and tonks FOUR down the ground. Stirring stuff from Australia’s tail! 80th over: Australia 207-9 (Lyon 23, Boland 9) Sundar enters his fourth over and Boland notches his 63rd ball survived. That’s the 80th over up in this innings. Will India bring back Bumrah for a final blast with the new ball? 79th over: Australia 206-9 (Lyon 21, Boland 9) Akash Deep returns to the attack and crashes it into Boland’s pad first ball. This looks close. Umpire says ‘Nah’ but India think ‘Yeah’ and sends it to the higher powers. No dice. It’s going down leg. Scott Boland breathes a little easier but not as deeply as India’s opening batters. There’s no way they want to face a Mitchell Starc over tonight. 78th over: Australia 206-9 (Lyon 21, Boland 9) Lyon slogs for FOUR! Jadeja put it on off stump and the old man from Young jumped out and put it through square leg. With 20 minutes left in the day’s play, Australia may be about to smash and grab their way to a couple of nasty Cummins-Starc overs in the shadow of stumps. 77th over: Australia 200-9 (Lyon 17, Boland 8) India bring on Washington Sundar but it can’t slow Australia’s inexorable crawl past 200. A Lyon single brings it up and takes the partnership to 27. Australia lead by 306. 76th over: Australia 199-9 (Lyon 16, Boland 8) Boland plays out another Jadeja over as he reaches then breaches his longest Test innings – 48 balls and eight runs. And he’s done yet. 74th over: Australia 197-9 (Lyon 15, Boland 7) Lyon edges Jadeja for a single. Neither side minds that. Can Boland carve another boundary. He has now faced more deliveries than Nathan Lyon and looks set for a big score – maybe even double figures. The only one who wants this final wicket more than India is my greyhound who is waiting for a break in play to be fed the last of his Christmas turkey. Sorry Bailey, blame Mr Boland. 73rd over: Australia 196-9 (Lyon 14, Boland 7) Lyon drives Siraj down the ground for a single leaving Boland to CUT FOR FOUR! That takes the Australian lead over 300. That is huge. This partnership has been worth 23 runs – every one them could prove golden. That hurt Siraj. He has 3-66 but still has a face angrier than a bulldog chewing a wasp. 72nd over: Australia 191-9 (Lyon 13, Boland 3) Bumrah to Boland. It sounds like a mismatch but the Australian No 11 has now hung tough for 30 balls. Bouncer. Yorker. Off stump, leg stump. Big Scotty survives it all. 71st over: Australia 191-9 (Lyon 13, Boland 3) A single to Lyon as Siraj strays. Boland cops a bouncer and flinches enough to pop it up. Luckily it comes down short of gully. Good bowling. It baffles me why India haven’t tried the chin music before to these two. Boland glances a single and takes a run which a direct hit would’ve ended the innings. 70th over: Australia 189-9 (Lyon 12, Boland 2) Bumrah barrels in and puts one on Lyon’s leg stump. His flick of the bat misses but there’s enough pad for a leg bye. Can Boland survive five Bumrah balls? Yes. He. Can. Gervase Greene has emailed to urge that we “officially drop the pretence that Cummins is not a genuine all-rounder? In the last year - and while captain, curiously - he has jettisoned the dour, but solid blocker propping up the tail. He can now accelerate the rate as required, not only keep out - but score from - even top-notch bowling. And most pertinently, he can flick these switches at will, depending on what the team requires. He is a marvel. A marvel he is, Gervase. And may yet prove it with a final burst this evening. 69th over: Australia 188-9 (Lyon 12, Boland 2) Time for another jet-fueled Jadeja over. And a little Nathan Lyon luck as he late cuts inches away from Rohit Sharma and steals a run. Blocker Boland survives a 14th ball as Australia lead by 293 runs. 68th over: Australia 186-9 (Lyon 10, Boland 2) Guess who’s back? Bumrah. Australia are creeping toward a lead of 300 and to reach that number would inflict an important psychological blow. Can India’s main man stop these bunnies from breeding 10 more runs? Lyon and Boland edge closer with two leg byes. And Lyon’s drive and Nitish’s misfield at mid-on adds another. These two have put on 14 runs for the 10th wicket. There’s a muted shout for lbw and a middlin review on the last but it’s way wide. 67th over: Australia 184-9 (Lyon 10, Boland 2) Spinner on spinner as Jadeja zips into Lyon. The Australian gets the better of the encounter, dabbing to backward point. He calls for two and it pressures the fielder into a fumble so he gets them. Then a single. And now more frustration for India as Boland’s cheeky single becomes a chancer’s two when the throw ricochets for an overthrow. The people’s hero is off the mark! Australia lead by 289. 66th over: Australia 176-9 (Lyon 8, Boland 0) Lyon is DROPPED! He was caught on the hop by a Siraj slower ball and tentatively popped it up at eye level. Siraj blinked at the wrong split second and spilt the chance. India have grassed four today by my count. Will it cost them in the long run? Siraj thunders one into Lyon’s pad and screams for an upraised finger from the umpire. It doesn’t come but Sharma shrugs and reviews. Unsurprisingly it’s sailing down leg side. Lyon celebrates by carving the fourth ball into the covers for three. 65th over: Australia 174-9 (Lyon 5, Boland 0) Here comes Australia’s No 11, local hero and Johnny Mullagh medallist 2021, Scott “Blocker” Boland. Jadeja gifts Australia a no-ball but Blocker blocks the rest to make it a wicket and five dots. Edged and caught! Cummins goes after another fine innings. Jadeja put it outside off and it gripped a fraction and Cummins’ artful steer became a top edge. That’s a crucial wicket but it gives Australia’s skipper time to put his feet up for a bit and prepare a plan for young master Jaiswal who has dropped three catches today and maybe isn’t feeling too lucky. 64th over: Australia 173-8 (Cummins 41, Lyon 5) We have 41,448 in the MCG and every one of them is on the edge of their seat. Lyon scampers a leg bye from Siraj’s first ball and gives back the strike to Cummins who cuts fine for another two to enter the roaring 40s. Great stuff from Cummins who, after 49 in the first innings, is now entering the rarified air of the full-fledged allrounder. And now he swings hard and high. Two there but he takes one to keep strike. Australia lead by 278. 63rd over: Australia 169-8 (Cummins 38, Lyon 5) Cummins steers a Bumrah yorker to third man. There’s a run there but he doesn’t takes it, preferring to protect the GOAT. Jasprit now gives him a bouncer to think about and the skipper takes evasive action. Then a yorker. Cummins is up to the challenge of both, knowing Bumrah can’t bowl forever. And now a little counterattack, leaning back and cutting to the rope for FOUR. 62nd over: Australia 165-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 5) Lyon edges for FOUR. Streaky but sweet for Australia. Mohammed Siraj adds another furrow to his well corrugated brow. Rohit Sharma has come alive as a captain this afternoon. Despite criticism of his leadership and a shocking run of form with the bat, he has injected his spearhead Bumrah with acumen and fired up Siraj to take three wickets. Not only is the Test and series in the balance, Sharma’s career might be too. 61st over: Australia 161-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 1) After a break for drinks, Jasprit Bumrah – refreshed and ready to bowl – steams in. Will Pat Cummins spurn singles to protect Nathan Lyon or will he trust the man with whom he orchestrated that famous victory at Edgbaston? There they put on 55 runs for the ninth wicket to secure victory in the first Ashes Test. Can they conjure more glory for Australia here? Not yet. It’s a maiden. 60th over: Australia 161-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 1) Siraj returns – face full of zinc, head full of steam. New batter Nathan Lyon flicks off the pads to get off the mark. Cummins does well to drop a bouncer at his feet. The next one is wide and Cummins opens the blade and runs it through gully for three more. Australia lead by 266 runs. Starc is GORN! The umpire went tot the replay but Starc walked. He knew he was well short of his ground. Dreadful mix-up by the Australian pair and probably Starc’s fault. He turned too quick for the second when Cummins, with a clear view of the swooping Nitish, cancelled it with a bark. But too late. Starc was well short of his ground and veered out of the path of the ball when he should’ve have tried to wear it on the body. 59th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Here comes Bumrah. Does he ever go away? He has Starc in his sights and the big man gets a single. Or is it two? NOOOOOO! There’s a huge mixup and Nitish has swooped and thrown it the ‘keeper. Rishabh Pant seizes the bouncing ball, removes the glove in a flash and throws down the the stumps at the non-striker’s end. This looks close… 58th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Starc attacks! That was a full blooded drive and if Nitish Kumar Reddy hadn’t dived for the stop it was four. Instead it’s one run. Desperate hours here at the MCG. A Test, a series and cricket’s world heavyweight title in the balance. Cummins carves Siraj for another two runs from the last. 57th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Cummins clips a single from Ravi Jadeja’s first ball. Australia lead by 257 now but runs are coming in a trickle. Do they risk being skittled cheaply by hitting out and trying and rip out India’s top order in the final hour? Or eke another 30 at snail’s pace so they’re safe at stumps? The question for Australia is: How much is enough? 56th over: Australia 150-6 (Cummins 28, Starc 2) Mohammed Siraj enjoyed that. He raises his arms and flapped them fiercely at the crowd, bellowing the whole time. Was that a sharp retort to the jerring Australian fans? Or a rev-up for the Indian contingent? Great theatre either way! New batter Starc flails one over the top to steal two runs. First ball is straight and fast from Siraj and Marnus misses. Big shout… OUT! Marnus reviews straight away but Siraj looks confident. Of course he does. Is there any bat? Replays show no and Marnus must go. Massive breakthrough for India! Siraj has three and Australia are back in strife. 55th over: Australia 148-6 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 28) A tight leave first up by Cummins as Jadeja ramps the pace up to 95kph. It narrowly missed off stump so it’s a good leave. And there’s a good shot! Captain Pat swivels Jadeja fine for a boundary. That brings the partnership to 57 and Australia lead to 253. 54th over: Australia 144-6 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 24) Attempted yorker. It’s straight and full but Labuschagne brings the bat down in time and jams it through backward square for two runs. He gets another two with a hip chip from the last. Hang on, it’s a belated no ball decision. 53rd over: Australia 139-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 24) Edged but safe! Cummins pierces slips and runs two. Weird few moments as the Australian pair knock back two singles from Jadeja. They need to win this Test to take the Sydney weather Gods out of the equation next week. Lose or draw and they’re behind the 8-ball. Finally Cummins taps another run to escape Cyclone Jasprit next over. 52nd over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Squared up and beaten! What a seed! Off stump line and seaming away. Bowler and batter share a grin at that one. Bumrah walks back to his mark watching the big screen and marvelling at his own genius. He proves it three more times as Marnus is made to look increasingly mortal. If you’re wondering… England hold the record for the highest score chased at the MCG which was 332 back in December 1928. Not a bad target for Australia to aim for I reckon. 51st over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Jadeja is whirling through his fifth over. He has 0-10 so far but has accelerated the run-rate no end. Cummins knocks back a single on the fifth to stay off strike to Mr Bumrah. Over to you Marnus… 50th over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Bumrah’s spell begins with a maiden as Labuschagne signals Australia’s intent to shut up shop when he’s the maestro is on and have a lash at whoever’s at the other end. We’ll see how that works out… Tick, tick… Bumrah. He has the ball in hand and we are about to resume. What a session! Yet again Jasprit Bumrah tore apart Australia’s brittle batting to bring India back into the game that looked to be slipping away. Bumrah has 4-30 from 14 overs and the scalps of Travis Head (1), MItch Marsh (0) and Alex Carey (2) are hanging from his belt to join that of Sam Konstas (8) from the first session. In doing so Bumrah went to 202 Test wickets at an average of 20. Incredible! Even so, Australia fought their way back in that final hour. Marnus Labuschagne has scrapped and scraped his way to an undefeated 60 and Pat Cummins (21 not out) is playing another brilliant rearguard knock to save his top order’s blushes. Those two have put on 43 runs in quick time – by far Australia’s most profitable partnership. This will be a fascinating night session. Will Bumrah the Destroyer return and rip through Australia’s final four wickets. Or will this epic Test take another twist with Australia batting beyond 300 and giving India a challenging target on day five? Grab a cuppa and contemplate. We’ll be back with the final session shortly. 49th over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) At 43 runs, Cummins and Labuschagne have given Australia its best partnership of the innings. But it almost ends as Jaiswal DROPS ANOTHER! The young opener has been banished from slips after dropping two catches there and put in the dog box of silly mid-off. Now Cummins fends at Jadeja and spits a catch at ankle-height but airborne enough to get fingers to it. Alas, Jaiswal is too high in his crouch and another chance goes begging. That’s Tea. 48th over: Australia 134-6 (Labuschagne 64, Cummins 21) Two from the first as Sundar shucks the rust with a first ball down legside. Second is wide again but outside off and Labuschagne slaps at it but can’t pierce the field. he does better next time, chipping past silly mid-on for a run. Australia lead by 239 and this partnership is now worth 43 runs. 47th over: Australia 131-6 (Labuschagne 61, Cummins 21) Another Jadeja over goes by in fast-forward with just a Labuschagne single from it. Looks like Washinton Sundar will bowl the last over before tea. Curious and curiouser… 46th over: Australia 131-6 (Labuschagne 60, Cummins 21) Short and sweet from Akash and Labuschagne swings it to the rope for four. Next one angles back and Marnus chops down late and watches aghast as it fizzes back towards the stumps… but bounces over! The luck of Labuschagne strikes again. He takes a single to celebrate leabing Cummins to carve the final ball to the boundary backward of point. Shot, skipper! 45th over: Australia 121-6 (Labuschagne 54, Cummins 17) Time for spin. Ravi Jadeja returns to the attack and his first ball is wide and full. Labuschagne cuts for a run. Cummins watches the next three then steps out and drives for four. Australia’s captain is putting together another valuable innings for his side here. 44th over: Australia 117-6 (Labuschagne 54, Cummins 14) Dropped! Akash Deep threw it down short and Cummins gave it a heave and top-edged. Nitish Kumar Reddy sent off under swirling wind to claim the catch but couldn’t get there in time. Valiant attempt. Cummins nails the next one and it runs close to the rope for another two. 43rd over: Australia 111-6 (Labuschagne 52, Cummins 9) Marnus gets his fifty with a push to square leg. It’s been another rearguard action by the mercurial No 3 who has held this innings together while never quite getting ion top of India’s bowling attack. Now Cummins flashes at a full ball outside off by Siraj. They run three. Labuschagne drives past mid-on for another two then works a single off his hip. Siraj is starting to tire, he’s too weary even to mutter murderous intent at the batters. Seven from the over. Australia lead by 216 but they need another hundred to be safe and apply pressure. 42nd over: Australia 104-6 (Labuschagne 49, Cummins 6) Uh-oh, Bumrah is back! After a short spell in the skinny shadows of the Shane Warne Stand, India’s destroyer has been recalled by skipper Rohit Sharma for a final spell in the hot half hour before tea. Bumrah runs in with 4-28 and you wouldn’t bet against him scalping the final four. Cummins fends off the first and Labuschagne rebuffs a single to fine leg to retain strike. Can Australia survive? Marnus finds a single from the last to keep strike for the next. 41st over: Australia 102-6 (Labuschagne 47, Cummins 5) With the zinc beading under his crazy eyes, Mohammed Siraj charges in at Cummins who flails at the first and edges the second, but survives both. He finds relief in a single to mid-on. Labuschagne, who is closing on another fighting half century despite living dangerously all innings, sees off the rest. 40th over: Australia 100-6 (Labuschagne 47, Cummins 4) Thick edge from Labuschagne and Jaiswal DROPS IT AGAIN! Good grief. A bad shot from Marnus – a half-blooded catching practice cut straight to the fielders – but an even worse attempt by the youngster, who reached with hard hands and put it down cold. That’s the second one Jaiswal has shelled at slip today after giving Usman Khawaja another life this morming. Is it the stroke of luck Australia need? 39th over: Australia 99-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 4) Captain Pat responds! First ball he faces from Siraj and Cummins clubs it into the outfield for four – all run. A statement shot. He will attack India with the bat and then go after them with the ball. Unnerved, Siraj sends the next few wide. Fourth Test on a tightrope right now. 38th over: Australia 94-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 0) Another one for Bumrah, but he’s bowling to Labuschagne, which is not what India want. In fact Labuschagne turns down a single first ball! Into the leg side, no thanks. Farming the strike with your No8 who nearly made a half century in the first innings. That’s the respect they have for this bowling artist. Labuschagne leaves where he can, gets through the over, then tries to dab four with a late cut from the last ball, but misses. And that, with a large exhale, is me for the day. Angus will be with you for the next four Bumrah wickets. 37th over: Australia 94-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 0) Siraj to Labuschagne, a couple of runs to cover. Andrew Jagels wrote in with a question earlier, before the action cranked up, so I will attempt an answer given it might be of interest to others. “Could any of our Indian readers clarify why some players have their first names on their shirts (Jasprit, Virat) whereas others have their ‘surname’ (Rahul, Siraj). The variety has always puzzled me.” I’ve had other correspondence asking this, so I’ll attempt the short version, based on working in cricket. Forgive any generalisations or errors. Basically, first name and surname structure doesn’t apply elsewhere in a Western way, unsurprisingly. India has so many different cultural and language groups that there are lots of methods of structuring names. Tamils tend to use their father’s name and then their own name, so Ravichandran Ashwin’s name is Ashwin. He wouldn’t use Ravichandran on a shirt, because it’s not his name. So his shirt name is also his personal name. But then Tamils who move elsewhere sometimes flip the order, so Washington Sundar’s name is Washington and his father is Sundar. Or our colleague Bharat Sundaresan’s name is Bharat, his dad was Sundaresan. Other cultural groups might use a common grouping name, like Singh or Sharma or Reddy, which are not really surnames but identifying broader group membership. So some coverage calls yesterday’s century-maker Nitish Kumar rather than Reddy. We went with Reddy because it’s not that common as a cricketing name, though it’s very common where he’s from. For another example, Jadeja’s first name in full is Ravindrasingh, but the ‘singh’ part gets discarded in the same way that the Kumar part after Nitish might eventually be. Then someone like Kohli, who does have a first name and surname structure, it’s more about marketing than naming. Having the Virat 18 shirt is a brand thing, and helps sell millions of copies, as well as promoting the brand he uses in other commercial ventures. The player agents probably decide that, it’s personal choice. Devdutt Padikkal was just out there sub fielding wearing a shirt that only said “Dev”. So that probably doesn’t answer your question, exactly, because there isn’t one answer, but that fact is also the answer. There are lots of different ways to structure Indian names, that are well beyond what we do with Smiths. 36th over: Australia 91-6 (Labuschagne 43) At a loss for words. Typed or written. Cummins will be in next. He’s done it again! Done it again, this time to a left-hander. Bumrah is unstoppable right now. It’s another snorter of a delivery. Around the wicket, angled in, then decking hard. Perfect length. Carey coming forward, trying to defend down the line. Not as extravagant an amount of movement as the Konstas one, but enough to beat the bat, perhaps brush the back pad, and nail the stumps. Bumrah has 29 for the series, 4 for 28 today. Can he keep it going? 35th over: Australia 88-5 (Labuschagne 40, Carey 2) Soooo. Labuschagne is looking good, and Carey has been in great touch. Australia still probably need another hundred runs though. Can’t expect the tail to deliver all the time. This is getting tight! Carey gets going with a flick through the leg side for two. Australia lead by 193. 34th over: Australia 85-5 (Labuschagne 38) Second ball and sixth ball of the over, those wickets. Bumrah has 201 at 19.46 right now, and in this series that’s 28 at 12.6. The series record for a visiting player is 38, by Maurice Tate. So a few more here and a big match in Sydney, who knows. They’re in it! India right in it now! Bumrah had just notched 200 career wickets at 19.56, the first player to cross that milestone averaging under 20. And he celebrates with 201. Two in the over. Marsh in a rut that he can’t get out of. Might not make it to Sydney. Australia 190 ahead, the wicketkeeper Carey coming out to join Labuschagne. Into the basket! Down comes the guillotine! Bumrah does it. He’s bowled so many great balls today that haven’t taken wickets, he deserves an innocuous one that does. In at the pads, Head flicks it away, but in the air and straight to short midwicket, where NK Reddy is hopping in the air and making it tough for himself but clings on to a ball around his midriff. 33rd over: Australia 84-3 (Labuschagne 38, Head 1) Off the mark first ball for Head, poked behind point, then Labuschagne guides a ball for three. He’s loving his threes today. India were bubbling about the place with the Smith wicket, they think they’re still in it. Got to lop off Head though, he could cost them the match in an hour. There’s that late-game probability! Not a good ball from Siraj, full and wide and there to hit if a player wants to. Smith does, huge drive, no footwork, reaching, and nicks it. 32nd over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 13) Time to try the man of the moment. Nitish Kumar Reddy bowls an innocuous first over, with a couple of twos in there for Marnus. 31st over: Australia 76-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 13) Carved away by Smith! Through the covers off Siraj, who has 1 for 16 and has just gone for his first boundary of the innings. 30th over: Australia 70-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 8) An awkward pull from Smith misses, a cover drive connects for three. Akash Deep goes past Labuschagne’s edge for the umpteenth time. How have they not got more edges here? 29th over: Australia 64-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 5) A few run-out jitters, as Labuschagne sends back Smith. But Smith goes back, and plays out the rest of the Bumrah over, wandering across towards the off side to block, taking a single last ball. 28th over: Australia 63-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 4) Snorter from Akash Deep. That ball goes up the trellis, past the glovery of Labuschagne and smacks the palms of Pant standing back, taken up around his shoulders. Then another, two balls later, and this one does crush his gloves. Hand off the bat, and he’s got the physio out there. If the bounce is doing this already, no way India are chasing a big score. Labuschagne gets some strapping on his forearm, like Konstas. It’s a big day for forearm injuries. Jeremy Stokes on the email: “Interesting re. Icelandic cricket term ‘the cat is back in the sack’. The Russian phrase ‘a cat in a sack’ loosely means not knowing whether what you’re going to get is going to be good or bad. Eg. ‘Sam Konstas is coming out to bat - this is a cat in a sack’.” Huh. Schrodinger’s cat in a sack? Where the unknown is less the aliveness and more the quality? Personally I would go for ‘Rasputin in a rug.’ Again, no idea whether he’s dead or alive in there. 27th over: Australia 63-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 4) What is Rohit Sharma’s favourite thing about lunch? He can ask Bumrah to bowl again afterwards. Begging for more magic. Bumrah must be tired, not so much physically but from the demand of needing to be the main player time and again. He bowls a few decent balls without the earlier menace, then overpitches and meets a lovely straight drive from Labuschagne. Top class, back past the bowler for four. 26th over: Australia 58-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 4) Lunch done, Akash Deep to start us off, but he gets too straight and he’s bowling to the Flick Brothers. Thee for Labushagne, two for Smith, all off the pads. Peter Leybourne, who is reading the OBO in bed in Bangkok and using the lunch break to make his breakfast, has sent me a glossary of Icelandic cricket terms. Personal faves, the wicketkeeper translates to ‘the keeper of the gate’, via the word vikketwörður. A duck is a duck but a golden duck is a falcon. Or if you say that someone is back in the hutch, you say “the cat is back in the sack”. I’m very interested in late-game-Smith, any time Steve Smith bats on day four or five. Because he’s rarely been effective late in games. You heard about his 34th Test hundred in this match – 30 of those have come in his team’s first innings. Only four batting second. Of those, all four were in the third match innings. Never made a ton in the fourth. Those third-innings hundreds, by the way: Edgbaston, his only twin tons, on his astonishing return in 2019. New Zealand at the WACA, on a pitch so flat that Mitchell Johnson spontaneously retired halfway through the Test. Melbourne 2017, when the surface was so turgid that they dug up and replaced the entire square. And Pune in 2017, when the game moved so quickly that he was batting a second time by day two. This isn’t a criticism per se, it’s just intriguing that a player can be such a dominant force in some ways and not a factor in others. Fun session. Some fine fast bowling, it was exciting moment by moment for a good while there. A few good shots, a couple of memorable deliveries, Jasprit Bumrah getting fired up on dismissing Sam Konstas and copying the young player’s move of waving to the crowd to get up adn about. Pretty good attendance by the looks, bottoms bays of the Olympic and Southern Stands filled out through the session. Nice sunshine out there and moderate temperatures. Australia in much the stronger position, there’s a big modern trend of overestimating how many runs one needs to defend in a fourth innings, but India remain in the game if they can get a rush of wickets happening. 25th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 20, Smith 2) Who said that Rohit Sharma is out of captaincy ideas? An over of spin before lunch! It’s bold, it’s daring, it’s a revelation. This is the incisive thinking we’ve been waiting for. Jadeja is the dart artist of choice, left arm straight, and he’s immediately clipped for three by Labuschagne. Smith tries a back-foot punch through cover but finds the fielder. And that’s it. It. Is. Sandwich. Time. 24th over: Australia 50-2 (Labuschagne 17, Smith 2) Labuschagne squeezes a single down to fine leg from Deep, second last over before the interval. Gets Smith onto strike, and gets Smith off the mark, a bottom handed wipe of a shot through midwicket. Like a mafia henchman, ugly but effective. 23rd over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Another scoreless over blocked out by Smith from Siraj, very happy to play for lunch at this stage. 22nd over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Akash Deep back for Bumrah, who did look like he was flagging in that previous over. And dishes out a working over! Smashes Labuschagne in the box, which is the trend of the moment, the mode du jour. Beats the inside half of the bat a couple more times, hitting pads, appealing. Loves an appeal for a very not out lbw, does our guy. No run. 21st over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Siraj to Smith, playing at almost everything, but taking his time to get a read of the pitch. 20th over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Bumrah with a normal human over, one that Labuschagne is able to defend without any personal injury or bowel-outraging alarms, before driving four through cover. 19th over: Australia 43-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 0) It was a great setup, if it was one. Four balls all going across, but pitching in line with the stumps first. The wicket ball also pitches in line, but just in line with leg stump, a touch straighter. And a couple of feet fuller, making sure the length is right. India need Siraj, who was so good on their last tour. He’s contributed today. Smith blocks his first ball. Another one clean bowled! Through the gate goes Siraj, lots of effort in the delivery action, and was there a little swing in there? Or was that seam? Siraj has been going past the outside edge time and again, now he passes the inside edge through a big gap and takes out middle and off stump. 18th over: Australia 43-1 (Khawaja 21, Labuschagne 12) Bumrah to Khawaja, who edges a run behind point, allowing the bowler to smack Labuschagne’s pads with an in-ducker and go to DRS when Umpire Gough says no. I thought leg side, live. It’s umpire’s call, and the tracking says possibly brushing the corner of the leg bail, so fair to err towards the batter. But a different call on field and they would have had him. Labuschagne adds another two off his pads to end the over. Eamonn Maloney has been studying the Wiki. “Unique but possibly not quite complimentary enough to be autobiography? Unlike the highly suspect page of an ex-AFL player I came across once that described him as ‘a successful businessman in today’s society’.” In today’s society! That sounds like a high-school debate opening. 17th over: Australia 40-1 (Khawaja 20, Labuschagne 10) Siraj isn’t bowling as short as Deep, but he keeps beating the edge too. Bowling across Khawaja, who makes it through another over and adds a run. 16th over: Australia 39-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 10) Five overs up front, now a chance of ends to bowl his sixth replacing Akash Deep. Bumrah starts with another leaping ball that smacks into Pant’s gloves after a fruitless push, but Labuschagne gets two next ball with a modest drive past the bowler. Beaten by the third ball of the over, very close to the edge and just over the bails as well, Pant appealing out of a sense that somehow, if the arc of the universe bends towards justice, that just should be out, even though the bat didn’t touch it. A hefty lbw appeal next ball, but Bumrah’s inward movement is taking it well down the leg side. Too good for thee, but too good for himself as well. Fifth ball, back past the outside edge, as the cordon hops and bubbles like the cheese on a French onion soup. Then Labuschagne ends the over with a bit of soup in his cup, as Bumrah cuts one into him and liquefies his box. Ouch. What an over. What a bowler. We keep saying things like this, but he is honestly on a level all his own right at the moment. 15th over: Australia 37-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 8) Much better over from Siraj. He draws an edge from Labuschagne that bounces in front of Kohli at slip and skims through his hands. Then a couple of really nice balls to the left-hander that threaten the edge. Now Bumrah is coming back. 14th over: Australia 36-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 7) Good pull shot from Khawaja. One of his main strokes when he’s playing well. Deep bowls a seventh over on the trot. Andy Bradshaw asks if it counts as a slogging injury “when the much missed Andrew Symonds ripped the bicep off the bone smacking Sajid Mahmood into orbit during the 2007 VB series, because Paul Nixon had irritated him so much?” We’ve developed a theory on The Final Word pod that Paul Nixon may have written his own Wikipedia page, given the level of detail and the fulsomeness of description compared to pages of some rather more prominent players. Go and have a look and tell me what you think. And donate to them. And donate to the Guardian, so I don’t get in trouble for saying that. 13th over: Australia 32-1 (Khawaja 15, Labuschagne 7) There we go. Siraj time, and the batting gets easy. Fish are jumping and the cotton is high. Three for Labuschagne, turned through square leg, three for Khawaja through point, two more for Marnus on the glance. The age of ease. Drinks. 12th over: Australia 24-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 2) Sixth over for Akash Deep, only a glanced single from it, he’s only gone for 13 in total. But we need that other column populated, Akash, to keep this game bubbling. 11th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) Bumrah gets a break. Amazing first spell, but I still think that Australia have had the better of it. India really needed Bumrah to get on a tear, get them three down perhaps. Could easily have happened, but another ten overs of graft and then the Australians can start to regain control of the innings. No run for Khawaja from Siraj’s first over. “‘You come for the King, you best not miss,’ spake Bumrah to Konstas.” That’s from Samir Chopra, quoting Omar Little. Konstas couldn’t do anything but miss that ball. 10th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) You’re hearing it more and more: Akash Deep, please pitch it up a little. Just a little. Deep is too shallow. He’s getting plenty out of this surface, exciting movement, but he’s kept passing the edge. Until he gets a nick! That is a bit fuller, but Labuschagne edges it into his leg first, and that takes the pace off it. Lands in front of slip. 9th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) How the hell is Khawaja still there? Two more in this over from Bumrah that go careening past the edge, as the batter tries to drive rather than just being a static target. It doesn’t work. 8th over: Australia 21-1 (Khawaja 11, Labuschagne 0) Right India, it’s time for Somebody Else As Well As Bumrah. Time for whoever that player is to do something with the ball. This is a good over from Deep, keeps Khawaja pinned down around the off stump, but can’t dislodge him. 7th over: Australia 20-1 (Khawaja 10, Labuschagne 0) Welcome to the jungle, Marnus. Labuschagne walks out and immediately gets beaten by another Bumrah jagger. Timmmmbbbberrrrr! What a ball from Bumrah! The da Vinci of hyperextension, except that Bumrah actually finishes his projects. That is unbelievable, in the literal sense. How do you play that? You don’t. You can’t. We can’t answer the question of whether Konstas can bat, because that wasn’t batting. He was just standing in the way. This ball pitches outside the off stump by a good distance, then seams as wickedly as the ones away from Khawaja earlier. But it’s seaming into the right hander. Screaming in. He plays the right line, for a ball that was moving anywhere near a normal amount. This one though goes past his inside edge. From well outside off, it knocks leg stump out of the ground. What a moment. 6th over: Australia 20-0 (Konstas 8, Khawaja 10) “I love the fact that after the last four days of Konstas mania, we still have no idea if he can bat.” Quite so, Peter Salmon. Might answer that before lunch. Konstas misses the first ball here, huge appeal from Deep. Senselessly, because that ball hits the top of the thigh. Nice movement, but pitch it up a bit, buddy. Nope, Deep goes shorter and Konstas pulls four through fine leg off a top edge, then nicks on the bounce past Jaiswal at gully for one. They’ve got deep third back for the scoop. Still no closer to an answer. 5th over: Australia 15-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 10) A delay while Konstas gets some strapping on his forearm and takes a couple of painkillers. Not sure what happened there. He hasn’t been hit, as far as I can see. Called for the physio immediately after the catch fell short. Can you strain a forearm muscle from slogging too hard? Bumrah keeps working over Khawaja. I don’t know how he hasn’t nicked one of these first three deliveries. They’ve all done too much, in the end. The third one is fuller than the others, and still deviates so far it misses willow. Last ball of the over, though, Khawaja can glance for four. 4th over: Australia 11-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 6) Still unconvincing, Khawaja. Misses a pull shot, edges to gully on the bounce, before flicking two runs square. Deep is bowling from the Shane Warne Stand end of the ground, the old Southern Stand. Khawaja drops a single. Konstas edged in front of gully. Jaiswal again. A very low ball, that one, but he hesitates and hangs back for half a second. Perhaps if he’d gone forward immediately he might have got fingers under it, but would have been tough. “Liked your piece on Reddy.” Cheers, Colum Fordham. “Together with Australia’s Sam Konstas, he has added a breath of fresh air to test cricket. All raw talent and nerveless aggression. Shame in a way that he capitulated early to Lyon but still. India have a faint whiff of a chance to draw the match if they dig in but it won’t be plain sailing. At least Reddy’s wonderful innings has given India some hope. Will be fascinating to see Konstas’ reaction now. I’m sure there will be fireworks one way or another.” 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 3) Bumrah’s turn to beat Khawaja outside the off stump, but again there’s no edge. Indian bowlers need one early. If Australia pass 200 in this innings then the game is all but gone. Good ball from Bumrah! Rearing at Khawaja, just past the shoulder of the bat as he pulls the bat inside the line. Khawaja chats to himself about it as he walks away. Then he’s dropped! Oh, that was straight to him. Jaiswal at a leg gully, almost, had to be expecting a catch in that position. Glanced off the pads, low and fast and flat, but straight into the hands at about knee level, and Jaiswal just lets it burst through. Huge moment. 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 2) Akash Deep with the new ball, not Siraj. If there’s any swing, now is the time. He has Khawaja hopping as ever, trying to play balls on a length. Gets one to fine leg. Deep bowls a goody to Konstas, that slams the seam and decks away, just past the edge. Then outswing but Konstas carves with the movement to deep backward for two, before being beaten again by a ball too short to take his edge. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Konstas 1, Khawaja 1) The Double Ks come to the middle, Konstas on strike to Bumrah… and there are boos as he takes a single first ball! Little pull shot. Khawaja glances his first run. Bumrah not quite on the spot yet, sore shoulders from carrying the side, all that. Bowls wide of the off stump and has a word to himself as Konstas stares back at him, then bowls leg stump and deflects off the pads for two. Pace down in the low 130s. Let’s give him an over or two to warm up. There’s the first Konstas shot! Charges, swats, misses with an almost horizontal bat, and the ball bounces over his stumps. John Starbuck, our most maritime-coded correspondent, writes in. “‘Morning, Geoff. Oh how I miss Richie saying ‘Morning everyone’. I’m currently drinking golden rum to help me sleep later (he says) and carrying on with re-reading Jasper Fforde’s The Woman Who Died a Lot, which I recommend, even though the dominant sport is not cricket, but croquet. More power to your typing fingers as I’m set to enjoy the OBO, so long as the rain holds off. What’s the weather forecast for the MCG?” I once confused some very pleasant Icelanders who thought I was talking about croquet. Weather is set fair, cool on the walk in this morning, but on the way to the mid 20s and no rain for the rest of the Test. So the Indian pair added 11 this morning, trimming the deficit usefully. Now everything rides on their efforts with the ball. Will Australia fall victim to the third-innings wobble, as they did in Brisbane? Will they seize control of this match? Sam Konstas is going to bat in a few minutes. Strap in, either way. Never mind, the point of contention is soon resolved. Team play from Reddy, he could have just batted for the nice red ink ton, but he keeps taking on Lyon and hits him down the ground again. This time elevated but not enough distance, and Starc at long off has the buckets out. Lyon gets three instead of Cummins getting four. 119th over: India 369-9 (Reddy 114, Siraj 4) Cheers as Siraj blocks the first ball. Not many in yet this morning with the early start, though the MCC area is well stocked. Siraj is able to squirt away a run fourth ball, then Reddy adds another. Then a big to-do from the last ball. Siraj jams down on a yorker outside off stump. It squeezes up from the edge to slip. Umpire’s review checks the bump ball, and the Bangladeshi third umpire Sharfuddoula rules it not out! Cummins is astonished, the Australians had already started wandering towards the fence when they saw the replay. Cummins is making the T sign for a review to the standing umpires, over and over again, while Joel Wilson tells him that he can’t review a review. I have to agree with Cummins there. There’s a chance that the ball is touching bat and ground at the same time as it arrives, I guess. That might be the umpire’s thinking. But it comes up off the ground and then subsequently off the bat, I would say. Touches the bat last on its way to slip. Anyway. Not out. 118th over: India 367-9 (Reddy 113, Siraj 3) Single first ball! Happy to let Siraj face the spin of Lyon. Interesting. Siraj might need to look for a run here rather than block out five balls. And he does so! A little prod behind point, nicely done. Reddy sweeps a couple of runs square. Then charges Lyon and smites four! That’s the stuff. When you may not have many opportunities to face, got to take the ones you get, and the young century-maker has been happy taking on Lyon all series. Down the ground this time. But can’t find the run from the sixth ball to keep strike. Cummins with a full over to Siraj could be the codicil. 117th over: India 359-9 (Reddy 106, Siraj 2) Cummins to bowl, Reddy to resume on a century, the onlookers cheer… and he plays a forward defence. Nice. Blocks out a couple and then decides to take the single fourth ball of the over, not fifth or sixth. So he’s decided to trust Siraj from the outset. Not so much that they take a possible run when Siraj blocks a ball into the midwicket gap. He spars at the sixth, down the line of the stumps, and it goes by the edge. Players are coming onto the field. Some Indian squad members are still taking high catches as the umpires walk out. That’s dedication. Now they’re on the move. Drop me an email, the address is in the sidebar. Or the bit up the top on your phone. The special part of yesterday was Reddy’s innings, one that he couldn’t have assembled without the partnership support from Washington Sundar. So that’s what I wrote about at stumps. Day 4, and the match is still is alive. I love that for us. December 28th may be known forevermore as Nitish Kumar Reddy Day. That’s unlikely, but it wouldn’t be outrageous if it happened. It was one hell of an innings from the young player to assemble his first century in Tests and to do so from No 8 in the order. India still trail by a lot, 116 runs, but they have a path towards at least scrapping this out for a draw, or if they happen to bowl well in the third innings then they could be in the frame for a win. So the scores are: Australia 474, India 358-9. Of course, the advantage is still very much with Australia, and all they have to do is bat decently in the third innings to put a win out of reach for India, and shoot for one themselves. First, though, they need to finish off Reddy. He reached 105 not out by the time bad light and rain ended play early on Day 3. He’s still there, and he’ll have strike. But he only has Mohammed Siraj for company. So this could all be over in a couple of minutes, or he might farm the strike for a while and whittle down that deficit still further. Let’s see."

          "bodyText": "Costellore Diamond Prosecco, Veneto Italy NV (£8.99, Aldi) In a sense, sparkling wine no longer has quite the sheen of glamour it once had. Thanks to the prosecco-led boom in fizz production and consumption that has been going on for the past couple of decades, it’s no longer considered decadent to open a bottle of bubbly of an ordinary drinking occasion, and it’s also become much more common to drink fizz with food. But there are still moments that would feel somehow less special without it – moments when even those of us who don’t bother with it the rest of the year feel the need to have at least a glass or two – and this Tuesday is very much one of them. As someone who considers themselves (rather pompously I’m told) largely immune to the influence of packaging and marketing, I have to admit there’s a rather fun, glittery, glamorous feel to my first pick for this year’s NYE; and the smart, pleasingly geometric, cut-glass bottle of the Costellore contains a very attractive, fresh, subtly, but not cloyingly, sweet prosecco, too. Les Pionniers Brut Champagne, France NV (£22.75, The Coop) Aldi also does a nice line in budget examples of the more savoury, champagne-like crémant sparkling wines that are made in France outside its most famous fizz centre: the retailer’s toasty-creamy Specially Selected Crémant du Jura NV (£8.19, Aldi) is outstanding value, but, so, too, is Burgundy’s gently honeyed Cave de Lugny Crémant de Bourgogne NV (£15, or £12 with a Clubcard, at Tesco; Waitrose), while a long-term favourite from the Loire, Bouvet Ladubay Saumur Brut NV (£14, or £10 as part of a mixed six, majestic.co.uk), is as brisk and crisp with green and red apples as ever. When it comes to good-value versions of champagne, meanwhile, it’s hard to look past The Coop’s remarkable, perennial prize winner Les Pionniers made by Champagne Piper Heidsieck, which offers classic brioche matched with luminous brightness and fine mousse, while Codorníu Ars Collecta Blanc de Blancs Cava Reserva 2021 (£18, ocado.com) is a richly flavoured but very refined example of Spain’s unjustly maligned, traditional-method sparkling wine. Christophe Mignon ADN de Meunier Brut Nature Champagne, France NV (£40.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk) Some of the most exciting and intriguing bottles in Champagne today are the work of small growers such as Christophe Mignon, producer of the pristine, scintillating, dry ADN, one of a growing number of champagnes made from the least renowned of the region’s traditional trio of grape varieties, (pinot) meunier. On this side of the Channel, English sparkling wine also continues to add new names to its upper echelon of producers, and I was impressed by the second release from a winery that makes much of its lofty position on the highest point of the South Downs national park in West Sussex: The Weyborne Estate Oriana 2019 (£48, hawkinsbros.co.uk) is a complex mix of nutty patisserie and bright orchard fruit with classic tingling English acidity. For English sparkling value, meanwhile, Waitrose has a very tempting offer for the flagship cuvée from one of its most established producers: East Sussex’s Ridgeview Estate Bloomsbury NV is £22.99, down from £34.99 until New Year’s Day, which is great value for delicious combination of apricot Danish richness with citrus raciness."

          "bodyText": "Foreign affairs The only thing that can be predicted with absolute certainty about Donald Trump’s second term as US president is that it will be unpredictable. Trump does not really know what he wants to do on a range of issues. He talks a good game, which is how he got re-elected. But he often seems to decide policy on the basis of what the last person he spoke to told him. Is he serious about mobilising the military to carry out mass deportations of “illegal” migrants? Will he use the justice department to hunt down political enemies and media critics? Will he impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and trigger a global trade war? Or will he act with greater circumspection, using these threats as bargaining tools? Who knows? He doesn’t yet. In Ukraine, it’s a fairly safe bet that some form of negotiations or talks about negotiations to halt, if not end, the war with Russia will begin. European governments appear to be preparing for a Trump-led effort to force a reluctant Kyiv to the table, with the price of peace being territorial concessions involving Crimea and the large chunk of eastern Ukraine currently under Moscow’s control. Any such deal may be preceded by a ceasefire and the separation of opposing forces along a line of control or demilitarised zone. Ukraine will want security guarantees against future attack. Vladimir Putin will want assurances Ukraine will not join Nato. A lot could go wrong. Amid rising tensions between Russia and the west at the year’s close, it remains possible the conflict will expand into a wider European war. It’s hard to believe that things could get any worse in Gaza and the Palestinian territories than they were in 2024 – but they could, and probably will. It can be assumed that an elusive ceasefire in Gaza will eventually be agreed, but at a high cost. It may leave hundreds of thousands of Palestinians permanently dispossessed and homeless, and Israeli forces occupying a large area of northern Gaza. Emboldened by Trump’s re-election, the hard-right Netanyahu coalition may move to annex much of the West Bank in pursuit of a “Greater Israel”. Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon, having taken a beating, will be hard-put to stop it. So, too, will the international courts. Joe Biden’s hopes of a two-state solution and a wider Middle East settlement will lie in ashes along with his presidency. Simon Tisdall Technology A few themes will dominate the year. The first is the AI bubble into which the tech giants have been pumping unconscionable sums of money with, at the moment, no conceivable or proportionate return. The two big questions then are: when will it burst – and when it does, what will be the consequences? Investors will lose their shirts, as usual, but the impact will be more significant than the dotcom bust in 2000, and stock markets will feel it first, as tech stocks have a disproportionate impact on the key indices. There will also be a consummation of the shotgun marriage between the tech industry and US politics. From now on they will be inextricably mixed – as the tech moguls intuited when they decided to endorse Trump. Elon Musk and X will thrive, as will Trump’s Truth Social. Bluesky will become the last redoubt of liberalism. And LinkedIn will follow the corporate herd. It’s not clear how Trump will vent his spite against Meta, but he will. The company may eventually decide that it will have to split into two entities: Meta US, which conforms to Trumpian decrees, and Meta EU, which can operate within EU jurisdiction and elsewhere. As far as Google is concerned, just about the only Biden initiative the US justice department will continue is the antitrust case against Google. This will end only when the company is forced to divest itself of Chrome (and maybe some other bits too). Elsewhere on the regulatory front, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under the chairmanship of Brendan Carr, will pursue fruitless attempts to amend Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to bring social media under the governmental heel. Carr also has fantasies about trying to ensure the first amendment protects only speech that is congenial to the Maga regime. Under Trump, cryptocurrencies will be liberated from the fear of oversight by government authorities, with societal consequences that will make current levels of grift and fraud in the industry look like a Victorian tea party. And finally, Global Britain will remain an interested but impotent onlooker on all of the above. John Naughton Food Food in 2025 will become like everything else in 2025: more extreme. There will be a superabundance of everything you like and everything you hate. YouTube channel TopJaw will be supplanted by an AI-generated definitive list of the “world’s best things” updated every hour and delivered in an editing style designed to be medically addictive. Simultaneously, the urge to experience individuality in an age of conformity will see an upsurge in those seeking out more organic recommendations from micro-influencers, and nano-influencers, and micro-nano-influencers (or, as they used to be known, “other people”). People will eat more – queueing outside whichever unsuspecting neighbourhood eatery has been anointed/cursed by the latest viral TikTok trend, a la Queen’s Wood Cafe in London (although they’ll also, inexplicably, eternally, continue queueing outside The Breakfast Club, for reasons unknown to modern science). They’ll also eat less – with the cost of living continuing to encroach from one side and the march of Ozempic on the other. Restaurants will somehow become more prohibitively expensive and more inaccessibly fully booked. Burgers will continue to become more smashed (see Supernova) and students will continue to become less smashed. We will crawl, terrifyingly, towards the era of the £10 pint. Everything will become fermented, raw, biodynamic, locally sourced, artisanal, vegan and three new things none of us have heard of yet but which will be a core part of our identities by March and passé by August. Consumers will know more than ever, but be beset by the perennial worry that they’re lagging behind on whatever the latest fad is, or was, or might be. And perhaps there are predictions to be made about things that won’t change. Tradition still means something in London’s restaurants. Neil the dessert waiter will continue to tread the boards at Oslo Court, fabulously diagnosing diners with the puddings they deserve, Brasserie Zédel will continue to offer remarkable value for money in its billion-seater dining room and Chinatown classic Wong Kei will continue to show the Yellow Bittern what it really means to be an unreasonable cash-only restaurant. Max Olesker Culture It is hard to ignore an exhibitionist, but it will be harder than usual in 2025 as a string of cultural figures with main character energy are placed centre stage. In February, Tate Modern kicks off its 25th anniversary year with a salute to the late Leigh Bowery, the influential clubber, designer, muse and performance artist of 1980s London. Bowery arrived from Melbourne, Australia, and his eccentric outfits promptly stole the limelight on the underground party scene. Those in Bowery’s orbit – regulars at London’s famed Blitz club – must wait until later in the year to get their own moment of cultural attention in a Design Museum show dedicated to the nightclub. The equally bold and alarming artist Jenny Saville will be showcased in her first major British exhibition, The Anatomy of Painting, at the National Portrait Gallery from June. Saville’s unconventional portraits focus on startling ways of seeing the body, much like Bowery’s images. A Royal Academician since 2007, Saville made headlines in 2018 when Propped, her painting of a large nude woman on a stool, sold for £9.5m at Sotheby’s. It’s still the record price paid for a work by a living female artist. But it is the queen of scene-stealing extravagance who will dominate from September, when the V&amp;A examines our lasting fascination with Marie Antoinette. The exhibition will look at the lavish style of the ill-fated French monarch and her role as an emblem of unbounded excess. Publishing has its own exhibitionist moment coming up in celebrating the fictional extravagance of Jay Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald’s enigmatic antihero of The Great Gatsby, now 100 years old. An American literary landmark, the novel will be four months into its centenary when a Tony Award-winning hit musical based on the book opens at the London Coliseum. From May, however, publishing headlines are likely to concentrate on Laura Bates’s new study of misogyny in the AI era. The New Age of Sexism will tackle the swift feminisation of our obedient smart-speaker “servants” and examine how deepfake technology and virtual girlfriends all pose new threats to real women everywhere. Showbiz, of course, has already embraced the digital future, and so the race is on to roll out the next convincing hologram or avatar stage show. The mega-success of Abba Voyage, revealed earlier this month to have contributed £1.4bn to the UK economy, has increased efforts to create another attraction. Pophouse, the Swedish firm behind Voyage, has pushed Presley rights owners to collaborate on an Elvis spectacular and has already bought up the back catalogues of glam rock band Kiss and 80s star Cyndi Lauper. Elsewhere, commercial negotiations are under way to set up an event based on David Bowie’s live shows, with the formal trademarking of a brand that includes rights to an avatar of the star. So watch this Space Oddity. Vanessa Thorpe Sport While there are no Olympic Games or World Cups to look forward to in 2025, there is still plenty of big sport to whet the appetite – led by England’s women football team defending their European title in the summer. A record 17.4 million people watched Sarina Wiegman’s side lift the Euro 2022 trophy with a 2-1 victory over Germany, and three years on they are among the favourites for the tournament, which takes place in Switzerland from 2 to 27 July. World champions Spain look like the ones to beat, however, with France and Germany also capable of going all the way. The US will also host the hugely controversial football Club World Championships on 15 June. Almost all the top European clubs are against the tournament, which has expanded from seven teams to 32, as they believe it will lead to competition overload and risk players’ health, as they will barely have a break all summer. Fifa, however, is pressing on regardless. England’s women will strongly fancy their chances of lifting the Rugby World Cup, which takes place on these shores between 22 August and 27 September. While women’s rugby has not broken through the same way as women’s football, that could start to change given the spotlight on the sport and the fact that the Red Roses have not lost since finishing runners-up to New Zealand in November 2022 and will be strong favourites. Finally, the global sports agency, IMG, predicts that 2025 will start the “era of wearables”. True, people have been wearing Apple and Garmin watches for a while to record their data while exercising. However, IMG believes that augmented reality glasses such as Meta’s Orion AR, Apple Vision Pro and Snap’s fifth iteration of its SPS spectacles will start being worn by more people to watch and engage in sport. “This will be the year when wearable tech finally starts to truly compete with the phone for our attention,” IMG says. “And soon, with a glance of an eye, users could find themselves connected to music, their fitness stats or the internet.” Sean Ingle Film Concrete provides the foundations for some of 2025’s most intriguing films. January sees the release of Architecton, a dazzling documentary by visionary Russian filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky which explores humanity’s relationship with our environment through the medium of, you’ve guessed it, concrete. The ubiquitous grey stuff also takes a starring role alongside Adrien Brody in Brady Corbet’s Oscar-tipped The Brutalist, the sweeping, epic story of a mid-20th-century architect who flees the Nazis and finds a wealthy but demanding patron in the US. Finally, there’s the wonderfully weird Canadian comedy Universal Language, set in an alternative Persian-speaking version of Winnipeg – a city that, according to the film’s quirky vision, is almost entirely built of concrete. Fans of gothic horror will have plenty to sink their teeth into (pun entirely intended) in 2025, starting with the release of Robert Eggers’s remake of the vampire classic Nosferatu on the very first day of the year. The film, which stars Lily-Rose Depp, is gloriously creepy and a sumptuously sensual visual spectacle. Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro (Pan’s Labyrinth) has teamed with Netflix to bring his vision of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to the screen. The cast includes Oscar Isaac as Dr Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi in the role of the Monster. Animation isn’t just for kids this year, with some of the most anticipated animated features exploring adult themes. Take Memoir of a Snail (out in February) from Australian Oscar-winner Adam Elliot. The film deals with depression, bad marriages, compulsive eating and hoarding, all tied together with Elliot’s trademark mordant humour. Gints Zilbalodis’s Flow, a dialogue-free animation from Latvia, explores a climate emergency through the eyes of the animals that find their world destroyed. Finally, there’s Wildwood, the latest from Laika, the studio behind Coraline. Wildwood looks set to reprise the same winning formula: like Coraline, the film is described as a “stop-motion fantasy horror”. Wendy Ide Money It looks as if 2025 will be a pricier year for UK consumers than anticipated. That is partly because many experts and policymakers agree that Rachel Reeves’s budget package unveiled at the end of October will push up inflation. Dozens of retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks &amp; Spencer, have warned that higher prices in shops are a nailed-on certainty because, they say, of the decision to boost the national living wage and raise billions of pounds by increasing employer national insurance contributions from April 2025. Meanwhile, Britons face slightly higher energy bills in January, putting more pressure on household finances, despite earlier hopes that prices would fall back. The Ofgem energy price cap for the period 1 January to 31 March 2025 has been set at £1,738 a year for the average dual-fuel bill – up from the current £1,717 a year.[ However, some consumers look set to receive cash windfalls that could help with the cost of living or go towards a deposit on a house, financing a big trip or paying off debts. We have all heard of “the bank of Mum and Dad”, but 2025 could be the year that “the bank of Grandma and Grandad” also starts dishing out cash in a big way. This relates to an announcement in the budget that unspent money left in a pension plan after your death will be included in inheritance tax calculations from April 2027. Experts have predicted that, as a result, many well-off older people will increasingly pass on money to grandkids, children and other family members while they are still alive (known as giving a “living inheritance”). They are also likely to withdraw more of their pension cash and spend it in order to reduce the value of their estate. That could make 2025 a good year for companies specialising in cruises, long-haul trips and home improvements. Talking of windfalls, during the coming months we will hear more about the billions of pounds of compensation that could be paid to consumers because of an unfolding scandal involving the alleged large-scale mis-selling of car finance deals. The UK’s main financial regulator is due to provide an update in May. Yet another budget announcement could mean that 2025 is a bit of a topsy-turvy year when it comes to housing market activity. Nationwide building society has predicted that the chancellor’s decision not to extend temporary stamp duty thresholds put in place by the previous government will lead to a “jump” in property sales in the first three months of 2025, especially in March, as buyers rush to complete deals, then a “period of weakness” for the next three to six months. Meanwhile, as with Taylor Swift’s shows, we can expect a flurry of news reports as analysts speculate on the scale of the spending bonanza that next summer’s Oasis reunion concerts are set to unleash. The reunited Gallagher brothers are playing 17 sold-out shows in UK stadiums and parks between 4 July and 28 September (more dates could be added), so that’s a lot of pints, parkas and bucket hats on top of spending on food, travel, accommodation and merch. One economic consultancy has predicted that each fan will spend £406, thereby boosting the economy by almost £500m. Rupert Jones Environment One small step for Trump. One giant leap backwards for humankind. Brace yourself for a flurry of grim environmental news when the climate-denying businessman returns to the White House in January. As was the case last time around, Trump is likely to kick off his administration with a series of decrees that roll back many of the nature protections and renewable energy incentives of the Biden years, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act – the most ambitious US climate plan in history. Globally, the biggest impact will be felt when Trump pulls the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The new president’s appointments will include Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, as energy secretary and Lee Zeldin, a former congressman who voted against wildlife refuges and oil drilling moratoriums, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. They will be charged with promoting an “America First” agenda, which means taking a wrecking ball to any regulation that holds back fossil fuel interests and extractive industries – and unlike during Trump’s first term, they will face fewer legal and legislative hurdles because the Republican party controls both houses and Trump appointees dominate the supreme court. Renewable energy may well weather the storm because wind and solar prices are now cheaper than oil, gas and coal. The biggest impacts will be on nature, people in the global south and international efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Rightwing parties throughout the world are likely to be emboldened to step up their campaigns against net zero targets. Political denials will make no difference, however, to the physics of the climate crisis, which will grow worse as long as emissions continue to rise. Expect another year of supercharged extreme weather and more intense drought, fire, flooding and storms. As usual, this is likely to be felt most strongly in the northern hemisphere summer. After two years of record global heat, the expected arrival of cooling La Niña conditions would normally be expected to bring some respite. But nobody is betting on that, because the world’s climate is now so disrupted by human activity that past patterns are no longer a reliable guide to future outcomes. If next year is another record hot year, it would be an extremely worrying sign and push fragile ecosystems, such as polar ice sheets and the Amazon rainforest, closer to a calamitous tipping point. The world’s attention will be on the latter in November, when the Brazilian city of Belém hosts the first ever UN climate summit in the Amazon. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has called this conference – Cop30 – “our last chance to avoid an irreversible collapse of the climate system”. This ought to be the moment when all the countries of the world submit updated national climate plans that respond to the growing severity of the situation. But the gathering will start under a cloud because of doubts about future US participation, the hostility to the process of Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, and the host nation’s internal contradictions when it comes to nature and climate. On one hand, there are extremely progressive forces inside the Brazilian government, such as environment minister Marina Silva and Indigenous minister Sônia Guajajara – but on the other is the powerful agribusiness and mining lobby, which dominates congress. Belém will struggle to cope logistically with the tens of thousands of Cop visitors. It may have even greater trouble preventing the system of global climate governance from straining beyond breaking point. Jonathan Watts Politics If 2024 delivered a landslide victory and a return to power for Labour, 2025 has to be the year in which signs of national recovery become visible: the party has to show its reason for governing. Keir Starmer and his party can afford to be unpopular at this point in the political cycle, even to be seen as error-prone in their first months in power. Tony Blair, after all, had difficulties after May 1997 and went on to win two more elections. What Starmer’s Labour cannot do, however, is continue to be perceived so negatively for much longer. The omens are not good. Labour put most of its eggs in the economic growth basket in its election campaign. Starmer promised to deliver the highest growth in the G7 by the end of this parliament – an almighty hostage to fortune. Rachel Reeves’s October budget then hammered employers by raising their national insurance to repair damage done to the public finances by 14 years of Tory rule. The result, the Bank of England says, is that growth is now all but nonexistent. Reeves will explain next month how she plans to kickstart economic activity. Public services, the NHS, social care, education, the courts – all desperately need more investment so that people can feel improvement. But an economy heading in the wrong direction means tax revenues will be below expectations, giving less to spend in areas of need. Dangers loom everywhere. Donald Trump’s return as US president threatens a global trade war, with tariffs of 20% on UK imports into the US, and 60% ones on those from China. The UK remains outside the EU’s single market and customs union – so it is horribly exposed. 2025 will see preparations laid for a renegotiation of the post-Brexit trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with the EU in 2026. But Brussels is not keen on big changes, and Starmer’s government does not want to risk an overtly pro-EU stance that might boost Nigel Farage and Reform UK or benefit Kemi Badenoch’s chances of establishing herself more firmly as Tory party leader. The only move that would make a big difference – UK re-entry into the EU single market – will not happen in Labour’s first term. In many ways the government’s economic and political requirements are at loggerheads as Reform UK climbs in the polls. Abroad, the UK needs to chart a difficult course with Trump’s Washington, the EU and China, and seek progress – showing UK influence – on intractable conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. A road ahead for Starmer’s government at home is not easy to see. It needs visible successes on the economy and on immigration too. Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell says a packed legislative agenda will show wider societal change is already in train. A planning and infrastructure bill in 2025 will sweep away restrictions that prevent the construction of new houses and stifle the economy. A crime and policing bill and a border security, asylum and immigration bill will tackle antisocial behaviour and people-smuggling. Renationalisation of train services will continue apace, as will reform of workers’ rights. Free breakfast clubs will be introduced in every state primary school. But with growth scraping along the bottom, evidence of improvement to living standards is likely to feel incremental at best. Labour’s best hope is to demonstrate that it has something approaching a coherent plan and that it might just be competent enough to deliver it. Toby Helm Lifestyle By now you might be familiar with what can only be described as “treat culture”. A bouquet of tulips on a Tuesday, a fancy skin mask for the weekend – it’s giving yourself something completely unnecessary yet cute by dint of the fact that you might deserve it. This is growing alongside the “glimmer”. Put simply, this is the opposite of a “trigger” – small moments of joy which have a positive impact on your mental health (the smell of fresh bread, the feeling of your cat lying on your feet on a chilly night). What’s more, the best glimmers cost nothing. The cool kids are hunting down vintage Stone Island and CP Company on eBay while the rich ones want Moncler’s ultra-technical one in cream, but whichever way your income is skewed, there is no question that the parka has undergone a huge cultural renaissance this year. This is in part because of the return of Oasis and in part because high fashion – particularly Burberry, Rabanne and Filippa K – has become so adept at rebranding something practical and warm as red carpet chic. Chioma Nnadi, head of British Vogue, recently wore her Loewe parka over a Simone Rocha dress at a fancy Vogue bash. The relationship between fashion and books will grow in 2025. Designer Marc Jacobs posts “reading hour” selfies on Instagram, Bottega Veneta’s Matthieu Blazy has this month created a collection inspired by Richard Scarry’s seminal 1985 kids’ book Biggest Word Book Ever using intrecciato leather, and German designer Daniel Del Core gave models a copy of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to carry down his spring 2025 catwalk. This year, Saint Laurent opened a bookstore in Paris, while Alaïa opened a London cafe, run by royal cakemaker Violet Cakes in partnership with cult bookseller Claire de Rouen. Now you can be well dressed and well read. Morwenna Ferrier"

          "bodyText": "Whenever I make a roast dinner, I save any leftovers in the fridge or freezer, because they’re a brilliant way to get ahead for another meal. Today’s one-pot dish turns those leftovers, plus a few simple additions, into an impressive-looking centrepiece. Leftover roast meat tahchin This has become one of my go-to dinner party dishes. I like to keep such meals simple, so I can enjoy time with my guests, and by cooking extra meat and vegetables earlier in the week, this apparently elaborate dish becomes very easy indeed to make. Tahchin is a magnificent, Persian-style baked rice dish, and I’ve deliberately kept this version very simple. Cooked rice is mixed with egg, yoghurt and turmeric, then layered with leftover shredded roast meat and leftover cooked vegetables. It’s cooked slowly on the hob or baked until the rice develops a glorious, golden crust. Once the cooking time is up, you should be able to see the crust around the edge – if you can’t just take off the lid and cook for 10 minutes more. Serves 4-6 with sides 400g basmati rice, white or brown 1 large egg, beaten 250g natural yoghurt 1 tsp ground turmeric Sea salt and black pepper 80g unsalted butter 2 red onions, peeled and sliced 2 tsp cumin seeds 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 250-300g leftover roast lamb (or chicken, turkey, pork or beef) 250-300g leftover cooked vegetables (eg, carrots, parsnips, onions) To serve 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped from stem to leaf 4 tbsp sultanas, or dried cranberries 3 tbsp shelled pistachios, or almonds, chopped Yoghurt Lemon wedges Leafy salad Cook the rice in salted boiling water for eight to 12 minutes, until just cooked but still firm, then drain and leave to cool. Mix the egg, yoghurt, turmeric and sea salt in a bowl, then stir this through the cooled rice. Melt half the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the sliced red onions and cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until soft and slightly caramelised. Add the cumin seeds and chopped garlic, saute for two minutes, then stir in the shredded roast meat and roast or boiled vegetables, season to taste, then take off the heat. Melt the remaining 40g butter, and use some to grease a medium casserole. Line the pot with baking paper and brush that with the remaining butter. Spread half the rice mixture in an even layer at the bottom of the pot, and top that with a layer of half the meat and vegetable mix. Toss the remaining rice and meat together, and layer on top. Put the casserole on a high heat and, once the pan is hot and the butter starts to bubble up the sides of the paper, cover with a lid and cook either on a very low heat or in a 190C (170C)/375F/gas 5 oven for 45 minutes. Once a golden crust has formed around the edge of the tahchin, flip it out on to a platter and decorate with the parsley, sultanas and pistachios, and serve with yoghurt, lemon wedges and perhaps a salad."

          "bodyText": "That’s all for today. Luke McLaughlin is covering the 3pm games and will also direct you to our City v Everton match report when it lands. See you a bit later for Wolves v Man Utd. Manuel Akanji’s reaction [Was a draw a fair result?] I don’t think so, no. We did way more for the game, created lots of chances and conceded a goal out of nothing. But that’s how it is. We could’ve scored three or four goals but the ball didn’t want to go in. I’ll be honest with you: it can’t happen that we nearly lose the game in the last minute. We’re trying to attack but then we lose the ball and it was like a 6-v-2 situation. Luckily I blocked the shot. Things like this can’t happen. [Are you still in the title race?] The season is not finished but that’s not our target. We need to focus game by game. Leicester away won’t be easy now with the shape we’re in. This is getting weirder and weirder. Manchester City’s run of form in all competitions now reads P13 W1 D3 L9 F15 A28. After first-half goals from Bernardo Silva and Iliman Ndiaye, Jordan Pickford save Erling Haaland’s penalty shortly after half-time. City had chances but Everton could also have nicked it on the break. For all City’s woes, the result continues a terrific run of results for Everton, who in the last three weeks have avoided defeat against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and City. This is what it does to the Premier League table. 90+6 min: What a chance for Everton! Broja again turns superbly and suddenly Everton have a four-on-two break. Four on two! Eventually he gives the ball to Harrison, whose shot is crucially blocked by Akanji. I’d like to see that again but it felt like Broja didn’t have the right angle to put somebody clean through on goal. 90+4 min Foden is booked for pulling back Broja, who has protected the ball really well since coming on. 90+3 min A really promising Everton break, sparked by a neat turn from Broja, ends with Gueye’s cross being blocked by Gvardiol at the near post. At one stage they had four on four and City were in trouble. 90+1 min Savinho’s pass, intended for De Bruyne, is mishit but runs kindly for Lewis, who whips over the bar from 16 yards. Half a chance. 90+1 min There will be six added minutes. 90 min: Everton substitution Nathan Patterson replaces Seamus Coleman. 90 min “Hi Rob,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Has a consensus pick for the world’s best player ever looked better than Rodri does now?” Good question. Roy Race? 89 min Plenty of City pressure now, though it’s all a bit scruffy and desperate. A draw wouldn’t flatter Everton. 87 min De Bruyne gets away on the right side of the penalty area, the space in which he is so dangerous, but his cross is crucially blocked at the near post. Branthwaite is then booked for a tackle on Savinho. 85 min: Double substitution for City Ilkay Gundogan and and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey replace Nathan Ake and Mateo Kovacic. 84 min “Delighted to read Paul McGrory’s recollection of that 3pm Ireland vs Poland Euro 92 qualifier,” writes Bob H. “It wasn’t the only game that kicked off early thanks to Lansdowne’s lack of floodlights, as Paul mentions. I remember being in class while the Ireland vs England game was on and the principal announcing over the PA in the most ‘school principal’ tones possible, ‘For those of you interested in the football, I have some bad news: David Platt has just scored for England.’ Cue an entire school’s worth of groans and angry yells. We didn’t learn about the equaliser until we’d got home. Great days.” 83 min: Just wide from Mangala! A cross from the left is cleared as far as Mangala on the edge of the area. He smashes a low shot that is going wide of the near post until it takes a huge deflection off Akanji and flashes just wide of the far post. That looked really close. 81 min: Everton substitution Jesper Lindstrom replaces the goalscorer Iliman Ndiaye. 80 min Meanwhile, Luke McLaughlin has all the team news for the 3pm games. 78 min: Chance for City! Savinho slips Branthwaite on the right edge of the area and curls a fine cross towards the backpedalling Haaland at the far post. He could go for goal but tries to give Bernardo Silva an easier chance with a header back across the face. There’s slightly too much on it and Everton are able to clear. I think it was the right decision to try to find Bernardo; the trajectory and speed of the cross were such that even Haaland would have struggled to generate the necessary power for a header at goal. 78 min Branthwaite is coming back on so hopefully it was an impact injury rather than any muscular damage. 76 min Branthwaite stays down after making a good sliding tackle on Haaland. This is a worry; he’s been terrific again today. 75 min: Man City substitution Kevin De Bruyne replaces Jeremy Doku, who had an okay game on the left. 73 min If it stays like this City will have won only one of the last 13 games in all competitions, which is beyond bonkers. 70 min: Everton substitution Armando Broja replaces Dominic Calvert-Lewin up front. 70 min The resulting corner is a shambles, totally wasted. 69 min A good Everton break almost leads to a second goal. Harrison runs Gvardiol and stands up a very deep cross towards Doucoure. He twists his body to sidefoot a volley that hits Lewis and dribbles just wide of the near post. 68 min City are starting to stir from their post-penalty slump, though they’re still a million miles from their rhythmic best. 66 min Haaland receives the ball in the area and tries to go past Branthwaite, who stays on his feet to make a calm tackle. Moments later Savinho curls a fair way wide from the right side of the area. 64 min Coleman plays an early pass up to Calvert-Lewin, who tries to run the last man Ake. For a split second it looks like he’s away but an imperfect touch allows Ake to slide in and knock the ball back to Ortega. Crucial defending. 63 min “This match is all squeak and no bubble,” says Lee Woodard. “Haaland is the fashionable Christmas toy everyone wanted a few years back but now realise it’s made playtime a bit boring and samey. Time to put the big toy back in its box and find the fun again.” I’m all for an extended analogy but that feels more than a little harsh on Haaland. The old quote about failure being an orphan doesn’t apply to this City collapse. 61 min Kevin De Bruyne, who has had a touch of flu, is warming up. Bernardo Silva rakes a drive from 25 yards that is booted away. 59 min That penalty save has winded City, who had started the second half really well. This is so weird. I can’t think of a single precedent, certainly in English football, for a truly great team collapsing like this. Man Utd had a shambolic spell in November and December 2001 but they didn’t lose nine in 12. 57 min Calvert-Lewin wins a header to find Ndiaye, who leaves the ball behind on the edge of the area but reacts quickly to return it to Calvert-Lewin. He tries to nip past Ake, who sticks out a leg to make an important tackle. Had he misjudged that it would have been an other penalty. 56 min Haaland’s penalty was far from perfect, slightly scuffed and not in the corner. Still a very good save though. One day Jordan Pickford will get the recognition he deserves. 55 min “Thanks for manning the MBM presumably whilst dehydrated from excess Tin,” writes Paul McGrory. “The England-Albania radio lesson reminded me of a May afternoon in 1991. Ireland (in the same group as England) had a crucial Euro 92 qualifier at home to Poland, which kicked off at 3pm due to Irish rugby bosses not needing floodlights at Lansdowne Road. Big Jack mania was at its peak, and our German teacher could sense that the half-class who had bothered to turn up weren’t interested in the dative case, so he pulled his car up outside the portacabin and blared the radio out. We all got to enjoy the first half hour of a 0-0 snorefest that ultimately cost Ireland qualification. Bah.” I have a vague memory of being at school for the 1-1 draw with England during the same campaign. Great story. You can imagine what the Sittingbourne under-16s brains trust made of Graham Taylor’s decision to omit Paul Gascoigne. 53 min Amazing. Haaland’s penalty was superbly saved by Pickford, diving low to his right. The ball kicked up and was headed across goal for Haaland to nod into the empty net – but he was a long way offside. 52 min Seamus Coleman is booked for playing silly buggers. 51 min: Penalty to City! Savinho, who has tormented Mykolenko at the start of the second half, beats him to a loose ball just inside the area and is kicked on the knee. A clear penalty. 50 min A deep cross is headed back by Haaland towards Savinho on the edge of the area. He whistles a half-volley through the crowd that is kicked away by Pickford, a good save as he must have seen it late. Kovacic then cracks just wide from 25 yards. 49 min Savinho beats Mykolenko again and crosses deep towards Haaland. It’s slightly too high for a header at goal so Haaland nods it back across the face and Everton clear. 48 min “What a contest,” weeps Paul Griffin. “Will the victor be this once iconic but now struggling side from the North West, which not so long ago had an almost unmatchable tradition of picking up trophies, but which slumped despite the largesse of a super-rich owner and access to crème de la crème La Liga coaching? Or will Manchester City pick up the points?” I mean we all knew what was coming, but at least it was delivered with a bit of flair. 47 min Savinho sprints away from Mykolenko, who makes an important lunging challenge to concede a corner. Foden curls it onto the head of Gvardiol, whose flicked header is blocked by Harrison in the six-yard box. 46 min No changes on either side as City begin the second half. “Everton seemed to have forgotten how to play football for 25 minutes,” begins Gary Naylor, “but once they remembered how to control and pass a ball, the lads have done well, probably shading it since then. There’s a feeling in the home crowd that Evertonians will recognise - an anticipation of an opportunity to moan and groan that so often brings it on. Next goal the winner?” I’m probably not the best person to ask given I congratulated myself on six Fantasy Premier League points for Rico Lewis before the match had even kicked off. Half-time reading Another face-scratching half of football for Manchester City. They took an early lead when Bernardo Silva’s shot deflected in off Jarrad Branthwaite, and with Everton’s goalscoring record away from home it was tempting to think that was that. It was not. Bernardo missed an excellent chance to make it 2-0, and a few minutes later Iliman Ndiaye flicked an excellent equaliser. It was Everton’s first goal away from home since mid-October. Strange times indeed. 45+1 min Harrison plays a neat one-two on the edge of the area with Mangala and lifts a cross that is headed behind by Gvardiol. Harrison’s inswinging corner is headed over by Calvert-Lewin, under pressure six yards from goal. Not a great chance, but a chance nonetheless. 45 min Now Foden, who has been increasingly excellent, has a shot from the left side of the area that is well blocked by Coleman. 44 min Foden’s corner is headed away to the edge of the area by Tarkowski. Savinho cracks a sweet half-volley that is blocked by one of the many outrushing defenders. 43 min Nothing comes of the free-kick. Coleman then gives the ball away from Bernardo near the byline and is rescued by Branthwaite, who belts the resulting cross behind for a corner. 42 min Doku is fouled just outside the area by Mykolenko, who gets a yellow card for his pains. 40 min Suddenly Everton fancy their chances. Ndiaye shuffles away from Lewis on the left of the area and hammers a cross that flashes behind Calvert-Lewin. That attack elicits a roar from the home crowd that is two parts defiance, two parts fear and fifty parts what-the-hell-is-going-on. Iliman Ndiaye has equalised out of nothing. Doucoure’s cross from a narrow position on the right came at an awkward height for Akanji, who should nonetheless have cleared it. Instead it brushed his knee, which wrongfooted Lewis and allowed the ball to reach Ndiaye beyond the far post. He took a touch and poked an early shot back across Ortega and into the net. That’s a terrific finish, really clinical. But Akanji should have cleared the cross. Not again. 33 min: Chance for Bernardo! City should be 2-0 up. Haaland seized upon a headed clearance and gave the ball to Foden, who rolled an inviting square pass towards the onrushing Bernardo Silva. He was through on goal, with time for a touch, but decided to take the shot first time from the edge of the area with the outside of his left foot. It whistled just wide of the far post. It would have been a lovely goal, and made City need a moment of swaggering brilliance to spark them, but it wasn’t the percentage option. 31 min There are seven more Premier League games today: five at 3pm, then Wolves 2-2 Man Utd (5.30pm) and Liverpool 4-0 Leicester (8pm). 29 min It’ll take more than one slightly fortuitous goal to replenish City’s confidence levels, so we shouldn’t be surprised that the game is still pretty flat. Foden is playing well, mind, and tees up Savinho for a shot that spins up off a defender and is held by the backpedalling Pickford. A comfortable save, although he might have been Origi flashbacks as the ball looped towards him. 28 min Everton win their first corner. It’s headed away to Gueye, who swishes a half-volley from about 23 yards. Ortega jumps to make a comfortable save. 26 min Foden puts Haaland through again, this time with a pinged pass from inside his own half. Haaland gets away from Branthwaite but Pickford is quickly out to dive at his feet and claim the ball. Good goalkeeping. 23 min I’m fairly sure, having seen a couple of replays, that City’s opener was an own-goal by Branthwaite. At the moment it has Bernardo Silva’s name next to it. Why I oughta. 22 min Foden plays a nice through pass to Haaland, who goes round the outrushing Pickford but forces himself too wide. He can only cut the ball back into the six-yard box and Branthwaite concedes a corner. Kudos to Haaland there; he could easily have bought a penalty (or tried to) when Pickford dived at his feet. 21 min A promising Everton attack, only their second of the game, ends with Mangala curling not far wide from 25 yards. Decent effort, and it was noticeable that Everton had plenty of time on the ball throughout that move. 18 min The atmosphere is still very flat despite that goal, which was greeted – as the great Clive Tyldesley noted on Amazon – more with relief than joy. I guess 12.30pm games can be flat at the best of the times, never mind when most of the supporters are nursing a bruiser between the eyes. Doku crackled inside from the left and angled a good pass behind Tarkowski towards Bernardo Silva. He made a late run into the area, tracked by Branthwaite, and tried to slide a low shot across goal from a tight angle. It deflected off the sliding Branthwaite before spinning across Pickford and into the far corner. The goal has provisionally been given to Bernardo but I’m not sure his shot was on target – I guess we’ll find out when we see more replays at half-time. City finally get a break! 13 min “I know it won’t make for the best MBM experience,” begins Joe Pearson, “but I hope this turns out to be the most Dyche match of all: tedious and pedestrian and ending in a nil-nil draw. Happy Boxing Day!” So far so, er, good. 12 min Haaland has a shot blocked after more good play from Savinho, who has been City’s most penetrative and fearless attacker to date. 11 min Here, this is good fun. 9 min Everton, more than most teams, take pride in their defending, and the early signs are that this will be another proud day for them. They know they have can keep clean sheets against the best, having done so against Arsenal and Chelsea in the last fortnight; that thought should sustain them during the inevitable periods of suffering. 6 min Everton’s first attack. Harrison curls a nice inswinging cross that just evades Calvert-Lewin, nipping in front of Ake. He would still have had a lot to do even if he had made contact with the ball, which he didn’t. 4 min Savinho, who has started sharply on the right, wriggles past a couple of defenders and drives a low shot straight at Pickford. There was a player sliding in front of Pickford, which could have put him off, but he kept his eye on the ball. 3 min: Gvardiol hits the post! City’s primary goal threat almost strikes. Foden took a short corner on the left and then clipped a nice cross to the near post, where Gvardiol rose between two defenders thumped a header off the face of the post. 2 min “I’m hug,” writes Amanda Knight. That’s it, that’s the whole message. Has another development in vibes culture that’s passed me by? 1 min Everton, in their dark grey change strip, kick off from right to left. “Fresh off a silly early start with the cricket, how are the exhaustion levels, Rob?” wonders Matt Dony. “Can we expect some tiredness-induced delusional entries? Like, I don’t know, City struggling to play coherently and score goals, despite having A comedy goal machine up front? Or maybe, Everton being solid and difficult to play against? All seems pretty outlandish…” I wonder how long you could get away with making the whole thing up. I remember being in an English lesson when England played Albania on a Wednesday afternoon in March 1989. Some lad claimed to have a radio under his desk, so we were all thrilled when word went round that England had taken an early lead. When they made it 4-0 after seven minutes we started to doubt the reliability of our intrepid reporter. A reminder of the teams Manchester City (possible 4-3-3) Ortega Moreno; Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol; Foden, Kovacic, Bernardo; Savinho, Haaland, Doku. Substitutes: Carson, Brits, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Simpson-Pusey, Mubama, Alleyne, O’Reilly, McAtee Everton (possible 4-2-3-1) Pickford; Coleman, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko; Mangala, Gueye; Harrison, Doucoure, Ndiaye; Calvert-Lewin. Substitutes: Virginia, Patterson, Keane, Beto, O’Brien, Chermiti, Broja, Lindstrom, Armstrong Referee Simon Hooper. “LFC failed to score against the Evo cos the game never happened,” writes Jon Dry. “Just sayin…” Did they score a goal, yes or no? Pep Guardiola on Manchester City’s new world “Is Seamus Coleman replacing Ashley Cole in a starting line up a candidate for oldest ever combined age for such a switch?” wonders Nick Smith. “Free sherry for anyone who can come up with an older outfield pairing.” Ashley Cole? Are you sure there’s any sherry left? It’s a good question, though: Seamus Coleman (36) and Ashley Young (39) have a combined age of 75. As with most age-based questions, the answer probably involves Stanley Matthews or Kazuyoshi Miura. Sean Dyche is one step away from using the V-word here. The day he starts talking about vibes is the day we know it’s over. Pep Guardiola takes to Amazon [How do you find your rhythm again?] I don’t know. Winning games, basically. We can’t think beyond the next game; we are going to try. I love the club, the hierarchy and the people, my life in Manchester. We have a lot of problems, for many reasons and the target is to turn it round. When we won everything in the past we had almost a full squad. Now we have eight important players out. When they come back they have to straight in the team, and with one game every three days they get injured again. We are in a cycle that we can’t get out of. Kyle is unwell, Kevin and Gundogan [who are on the bench] have had flu the last few days, Jack [Grealish] is injured. Football is unpredictable. When you think, ‘Oh it’s going to be difficult’, maybe our form will change. [On the transfer window] If we can we have to add players, definitely. Saying that, I don’t know if it will happen because the winter transfer window is not easy. Stats department City have won 14 and drawon of their last 15 games against Everton, so there’s that. Barney Ronay on City’s astonishing collapse There is no obvious explanation for any of this. A team that were all aura, that carried their presence before them like a lance have become an anti-presence, stuffed shirts, straw men. As ever the explanations tend to divide into the macro and micro view of history. Details will always decide a game. But we remain addicted to our sweeping narratives. So the more hard-headed analysis says: take the Ballon d’Or winner out of any team, chuck in one or two key defensive injuries, and there will of course be a drop-off. Nathan Ake, Savinho and Jeremy Doku come into the City side in place of Ilkay Gundogan and the injured pair of Jack Grealish and John Stones. Everton start Seamus Coleman at right-back in place of the suspended Ashley Young. That’s the only change from the goalless draw against Chelsea on Sunday. Manchester City (possible 4-3-3) Ortega Moreno; Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol; Foden, Kovacic, Bernardo; Savinho, Haaland, Doku. Substitutes: Carson, Brits, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Simpson-Pusey, Mubama, Alleyne, O’Reilly, McAtee Everton (possible 4-2-3-1) Pickford; Coleman, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko; Mangala, Gueye; Harrison, Doucoure, Ndiaye; Calvert-Lewin. Substitutes: Virginia, Patterson, Keane, Beto, O’Brien, Chermiti, Broja, Lindstrom, Armstrong Referee Simon Hooper. You don’t have to wait till New Year’s Day to start a resolution. STOP EFFING DRINKING. Manchester City will hope that the Christmas break – all four days of it – is the cue for them to emerge from the astonishing slump of the past two months. It’ll probably never make sense that a team of City’s calibre lost nine games in 12, but the sooner they start winning the sooner they can consign it to the annals. City have a relatively kind run of fixtures in the next few weeks, starting at home to Everton today. That said, Arsenal and Chelsea have both come up dry against Sean Dyche this month, and even Liverpool couldn’t score against them three weeks ago. Any goals are likely to be hard-earned. Kick off 12.30pm"

          "bodyText": "The first quarter of the 21st century is almost up, assuming one regards 31 December 1999 to have been the last day of the last millennium (non-partying pedants insist the date actually fell on the final day of 2000). It is the cue for analysts at Deutsche Bank to remind investors how much can change in the course of 25 years, in this case from the days when Nokia phones and fax machines, rather than iPhones and Amazon, were everyday features of life. Here’s one jaw-dropper: back in sunny days of 1999, there was a live debate as to when the US would pay down its entire stock of government debt. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reckoned the glorious day would arrive sometime in 2013. In reality, borrowing headed in the other direction almost immediately – and the US debt-to-GDP ratio is now above 100%. The CBO reckons annual deficits will take the ratio to 160% by 2050. In similar fashion, delusional dotcom thinking at the turn of the century provoked ridiculous speculation that the stock market was heading for the moon. A book called Dow 36,000 became a bestseller, predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average, then about 10,000, would hit the named level “within a few years”. It took 22 years. Deutsche calculates that, for stock market investors, the quarter century wasn’t much to shout about. US equities have left most other markets – including the UK – for dust, but they recorded their second-worst performance in the nine quarter centuries since 1800 with a 4.9% return above inflation. That is despite the increase in recent years from dominant tech superstars such as Apple and Nvidia. Gold actually did better in an era of aggressive central bank and government interventions to combat everything from the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, 9/11 in 2001, the global financial crisis in 2008, Covid in 2020, and the surge in energy and food prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “There’s still a big outstanding question as to whether this buildup of debt is storing up significant problems for the future,” writes Jim Reid, the Deutsche head of global economics. You bet. Debt is one of his three helicopter-view big factors for the next quarter century, he argues. Another is demographics, where there is strong correlation to both growth in gross domestic product and returns from equities. Unfortunately, trends there are not encouraging. “Given that demographics almost certainly deteriorate further in the 2024-49 quarter century, it stands to reason that all other things being equal (they may not be), you would expect another quarter century of below long-term average real GDP growth and real equity returns, especially in the developed market world,” Reid writes. Thus it’s hard to argue with the conclusion that that if debt and demographics are weighing on rates of productivity growth, as they did in the last 25 years, AI is “the great hope” for investors: “The prospect of artificial general intelligence arriving as we reach the second half of the 2025-49 quarter century is real and could completely revolutionise the world.” That doesn’t necessarily mean the outperformance of tech-heavy, but already richly valued, US markets is the way to bet. AI products could become “commoditised and inexpensive”, making it hard for the tech companies to recoup their hundreds of billions of investment while lifting the tide for everyone. Rather, Deutsche’s point is that “with regards to AI and tech-led productivity gains, it feels like we desperately need it given demographics and debt”. That is the slightly depressing conclusion of its grand multidecade sweep of the horizon. Deutsche still sees equities recording “notably higher” real returns than government bonds, as is normal in most multidecade periods. But, geopolitics aside, the swing factor for returns is whether the AI-led revolution also revolutionises productivity."

          "bodyText": "A celebratory bottle of bubbly doesn’t just mean champagne any more. Sure, it could be champagne, but it also could be méthode Tasmanoise, crémant or even English or Indian sparkling wine. Whether it’s dryness, flavour, or a specific country of origin or you’re looking for, there is a fizz to fit the bill. Here’s a selection of the best supermarket, wine club and online picks to raise a glass with. Bottoms up! Best champagne The Society’s Champagne Brut NV £33.81 at the Wine Society The Wine Society’s own-brand champagne is a wine trade favourite. Produced by champagne house Alfred Gratien, it’s a classic chardonnay-focused blend with rich notes of toasted brioche, balanced with a fresh, lemony zestiness. This champers is exceptional value for money, especially when you go for a case of six. Party time. Best value (prosecco) Finest Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG £10 at Tesco Is it worth spending an extra £1.50 for the “G” on the DOC? Simply put: yes. Prosecco from Valdobbiadene is a different beast – the bubbles are finer, the fruit is brighter and the texture is softer. A special wine at a bargain price. Best crémant Cave de Turckheim Crémant d’Alsace £13.99 at Fenwick £13.99 at Waitrose Cellar Champagne made in Alsace with different grapes – pinot blanc and pinot gris – give it notes of blossom, green apple and honey. Cave de Turckheim has a solid reputation, so you’re in safe hands with this one. Best cava Vinicola Nulles, Adernats Cava de Guarda Brut Nature NV £14 at Uncharted Wines £14.05 at Parched Wine Cava is often overlooked in favour of a similar-priced prosecco, but it actually has more in common with champagne. It undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle (rather than a tank, like prosecco). Beautifully bubbly Brut Nature cava is good-quality stuff, made from organic grapes and aged in a bottle for 24 months. Best English wine Chapel Down Brut NV £22 at Amazon £26.99 at Master of Malt An English wine for fans of champagne. It’s made in the same way, with the same grape varieties, and grown on the chalky North Downs of Kent. Chapel Down brings you crisp and fresh British bubbles with flavours of crunchy red apples and strawberries – perfect for a new year celebration. Best lambrusco Venturini Baldini Montelocco Lambrusco Rosso £14.75 at Abel &amp; Cole £16.50 at Vintage Roots Your idea of sparkling red wine, in particular lambrusco, may be a hangover from the 1970s, but this speciality from the hills of Reggio Emilia is having its time in the sun once again. Venturini Baldini is a reliable producer to seek out for its lively, ruby-coloured lambrusco wines, which are all organic. This one is aromatic and herbaceous with flavours of black cherries and cassis. Drink chilled. Best Indian bubbly Grover Zampa Soirée Brut £19 at Maharaja Drinks Impress guests with something a bit different: sparkling wine from India. The Grover Zampa Soirée Brut hails from Bengaluru and it’s made like champagne, with the chenin blanc grape. It’s on the sweeter side of dry, with fruity notes of pear and lemon, but the crisp acidity will cut through anything fried and rich. Best Tasmanian bubbly Jansz Premium Cuvée NV £13.99 at Waitrose Cellar £17.99 at Loki Wine Made in the méthode Tasmanoise (which is the same as méthode Champenoise, but Tasmanian) in the cool bit of Australia, this lively sparkling has delicious notes of citrus and nougat. Fun and approachable but made from serious stuff. Best no-alcohol sparkling wine Kylie Minogue alcohol free sparkling rosé £5.49 at the Bottle Club £6 at Ocado If anyone knows how to party, it’s Kylie. This pink-hued fizz, with popping flavours of fresh raspberries and strawberry laces, hits all the right notes for a celebration without the alcohol. • For more no-booze bubbles, read our guide to the best non-alcoholic champagne and sparkling wines Sophia Longhi is an award-winning wine communicator, wine writer and international wine judge.

          "bodyText": "Konstas’s joyous, impudent 65-ball 60, a debut innings like no other, gave Australia a grip on the game that they may not relinquish. India loosened it slightly during the last session, when they reduced Australia from 237 for 2 to 299 for 6, but overall it was Australia’s day. And it was undeniably Sam Konstas’s day. 86th over: Australia 311-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) A swinging yorker from Bumrah is played well by Cummins, who clips it into the leg side for a couple. Those are the last runs of a terrific day’s play, one that will be forever associated with the audacious brilliance of Sam Konstas. 85th over: Australia 308-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) Cummins edges Deep wide of third slip for four. He was worried for a split-second and and snapped his head round to follow the ball, but it bounced well short. Deep gets a move on to ensure there will be time for one more over. 84th over: Australia 303-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 1) Bumrah swings one back into Cummins and goes up for LBW. Too high, maybe leg side as well. Cummins takes a couple of leg-byes later in the over before pushing a single to get off the mark. That should be Bumrah’s last over of the day; if so he’ll end with slightly unusual figures of 20-7-72-3. 83rd over: Australia 300-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 0) A leg-bye brings up Australia’s 300. They’re still ahead in the game but India have done well to peg them back from 237 for 2. Deep ends an excellent over with a good delivery that Smith edges onto his inner thigh. He felt that. Good lord, that’s unplayable! Akash Deep, given the new ball ahead of Siraj, starts with a monstrous seaming lifter that Carey tickles through to Pant. It’s Deep’s first wicket of the innings, deserved reward for some terrific bowling. He’s arguably been India’s best bowler today, even though Bumrah has three-for. 82nd over: Australia 299-5 (Smith 68, Carey 31) Bumrah is taking the second new ball now. Two late wickets would make this a pretty good day for India. Carey takes his innings in his hands by running down the track to chip over the leg side. The ball teases mid-on before dropping safely for a couple of runs. A square drive for two more brings up a busy fifty partnership from 76 balls. 81st over: Australia 292-5 (Smith 68, Carey 24) No he’s not; Reddy is going to continue with the old ball. I’m not sure what happened there because Bumrah looked ready to go. There are suggestions it might be because of the light but then Reddy is a seam bowler and I don’t think the umpires can distinguish between fast-medium and medium. Anyway, Reddy bowls another uneventful over that yields just a single for Carey. “A much earlier OBO post enthused about how young Konstas’ knock would be a thrill for the massive Greek community here, especially in my old hometown of Melbourne,” writes Gervase Greene. “It reminded me how remarkable it is that such a huge diaspora here, ridiculously abundant with gifted football and soccer stars, has somehow missed the top cricket tier. For example, even the brilliantly intimidating Marcus Stoinis, I’m fairly sure, has never played an actual Test match. Go figure.” While I’m all for diversity and brilliantly intimidating cricketers, Stoinis isn’t a Test player, is he? 80th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) A maiden from Washington ends act one of this Test match. The second new ball is available and Jasprit Bumrah, back on the field, is going to take it. 79th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) We won’t get the full 90 overs in today, probably more like 84 or 85. Jasprit Bumrah is still off the field but you’d imagine Deep and Siraj will take the new ball in his absence. Reddy has an LBW shout against Carey turned down. It was a nice delivery that jagged back off the seam but Carey got a thick inside edge onto the pad. 78th over: Australia 288-5 (Smith 66, Carey 22) Smith has slowed down slightly since pulling Siraj for six, though it’s unlikely to affect his concentration. It feels like he’s taking a bit of downtime ahead of the second new ball, which will be available in two overs’ time. 77th over: Australia 286-5 (Smith 65, Carey 21) Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has bowled only two overs today, almost strikes with the first ball of a new spell when Smith plays a lazy shot that bounces just over the stumps. That was really close. 76th over: Australia 282-5 (Smith 63, Carey 19) Washington has been tidy without really threatening. The wicket of Labuschagne came from an unforced error. But he is at least holding up an end to get India through to the second new ball. “I’m going to claim providing Geoff with that Mr Smith Goes to Washington line a few years ago,” writes Ray Murphy. “He even replied at the time giving an ‘elephant stamp’ for creativity.” Bumrah had some treatment during the drinks break and is now leaving the field. He’s walking freely but that’s a concern for India; it looks like a calf problem. Might just be cramp. 75th over: Australia 279-5 (Smith 62, Carey 18) Carey sniffs at a good delivery from Siraj and is beaten. A misfield from Bumrah at long on – not his first of the day – turns one run into two, and there’s another misfield in the covers off the next delivery. Oh dear. Time for drinks. 74th over: Australia 276-5 (Smith 62, Carey 15) Carey jumps all over Washington Sundar, slog-sweeping handsomely over wide mid-on for six more. He has quietly had a terrific year with the bat, averaging just shy of 40. “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” Especially if England had a load of Brooks, Roots and Woods. 73rd over: Australia 269-5 (Smith 62, Carey 8) Siraj replaces Bumrah, who took care of business in a short spell of 3-0-14-2. He’ll be back with the second new ball you’d imagine. Smith punches a nice drive for three; the loss of those three wickets has not changed his batting one iota. To prove the point, he pulls the last ball of the over mightily over square leg for six. This is the best I’ve seen him bat in a long time. A couple of you have mentioned the Mr Smith/Washington line a few overs ago. I can’t take credit for that; Geoff (I think) referenced it during the 2020-21 series and it’s been burned in the memory ever since. Steal from the best and all that. 72nd over: Australia 258-5 (Smith 53, Carey 6) “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” That brief innings from Mitch Marsh continued a run of form that is becoming a concern. These are his scores in Tests this year: 54, 5, 21, 10, 40, 0, 0, 80, 6, 47, 9, 5, 2, 4. 71st over: Australia 254-5 (Smith 50, Carey 5) Bumrah is slightly too straight to the new batter Carey, who is able to work him behind square for a couple of singles. Smith pushes another into the off side to reach a serene, authoritative half-century from 71 balls. He’s looked terrific. A poor over by Bumrah’s standards ends with a wide delivery that Carey cuts for two. 70th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 48, Carey 1) Carey pushes Washington for a single to get off the mark. I’m surprised Rohit hasn’t gone in for the kill and brought Siraj back at this end. I know the second new ball is due after 80 overs but if necessary you could leave it until the morning; this is the time to strike. 69th over: Australia 246-5 (Smith 47, Carey 0) Since drinks Australia have lose three for 12 in four overs. Smith is squared up by Bumrah and gets a leading edge into the off side for a single. Again, India won’t mind that as it gives Bumrah the chance of five deliveries at Marsh. That’s all he needs. Marsh drives nicely for four, is hit on the glove by a nasty lifter and then top-edges a lusty pull through to Rishabh Pant. He’s usually so good on the pull but that zipped off the pitch and was on him too quickly. I’m not sure it was short enough for the shot either. 68th over: Australia 241-4 (Smith 46, Marsh 0) Smith carries on as if nothing has changed, rolling his wrists to collect a single off Washington’s first ball. Marsh defends the rest of the over. 67th over: Australia 240-4 (Smith 45, Marsh 0) Even on a day when he’s been nowhere near his best, Bumrah has taken 2 for 53 and is on the prowl for more. Bumrah returns in the hope of getting Travis Head early. Smith drives his first ball for three, the third run coming after a misfield from Siraj. I wonder if that was deliberate to get Head on strike. If it was, Siraj is a twisted genius because Head has gone for a duck! He shouldered arms to an immaculate delivery from round the wicket that came back just enough to trim the off bail. Now then. 66th over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 42, Head 0) The new batter is India’s Kryptonite. But if they can get him early they’ll be back in the contest. The drinks break has done for Marnus Labuschagne. He charged the first ball of the next over and swished a drive towards mid-off, where Kohli leapt to take a good catch. Labuschagne leaves the field in a manner that almost redefines the phrase “trudging off”; he can’t believe he’s given his wicket away like that. 65th over: Australia 237-2 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 42) Yikes. Out of nothing, Deep gets one to spit from a length and beat Labuschagne. It straightened a touch as well, which might actually have saved Labuschagne. This has been an impressive old-ball spell from Deep, one that deserves better than figures of 6-1-26-0. 64th over: Australia 233-2 (Labuschagne 69, Smith 41) Mr Smith goes after Washington, charging down the pitch to blast a straight drive for four. This is looking very ominous for India, not just in this game but also ahead of the Sydney Test. Khawaja, Labuschagne and Smith are all in a far better place than they were at the start of the series. 63rd over: Australia 226-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 36) Labuschagne and Smith are the most prolific third-wicket partnership in Australian Test history, with around 2350 runs at an average of 60. It’s been a while since their last century stand, though, which was at Lord’s in 2023. They may rectify that in the next hour. Smith mistimes a pull over midwicket for three to take the partnership to 72. “Is there any shade on the ground?” says Adam Humphries. “If there is, I’d be parking Bumrah in it and bringing him on late in the day. Seems to be the Aussies’ day, but the visitors might get a bit lucky as the finish of play approaches with a rested strike bowler.” It must be so difficult to resist the temptation to bowl him, especially when you’re in as much trouble as India are here. I agree, though; I’d be inclined to let him rest until either the second new ball is available or Travis Head arrives at the crease. 62nd over: Australia 223-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 33) Washington appeals unsuccessfully for LBW when Labuschagne misses a reverse sweep. Scratch that, replays show he gloved it. Rohit looked slightly more inclined to review that than the Deep appeal, but not with only one left. 61st over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) For the third time in this spell, Deep begs Joel Wilson to give Smith out LBW. It was a good delivery which straightened off the seam to hit Smith on the back leg, but it looked quite high and there’s no chance Rohit Sharma can risk his last review on that. Replays confirm it was bouncing over and was probably going down leg. A maiden from Deep, perhaps his best over to date, includes a beauty that beats Smith outside off. 60th over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) Washington Sundar replces Jadeja, who grazes with figures of 14-2-54-1. Four singles from the over, all taken with minimal risk. It feels like India are entering a world of pain. 59th over: Australia 217-2 (Labuschagne 64, Smith 30) Deep beats Labuschagne with a clever wide outswinger. Given Labuschagne’s recent struggles, it’s odd that India haven’t tempted himwith more deliveries like that. Runs continue to flow, with 40 in six overs since tea. Labuschagne pulls for three, Smith fences through the slips for three more and then a Bumrah misfield gives Labuschagne a second run. “Hey Rob, multicultural crowd of over 80,000,” says Ray Murphy. “Is there a better Leviathan-sized ground in the world to watch cricket?” I’m probably not the best person to ask, but none come to mind. 58th over: Australia 208-2 (Labuschagne 58, Smith 27) Smith rocks back to cart Jadeja wide of mid-on for four more. That brings up a ruthless fifty partnership from 82 balls; Smith celebrates by mauling the next delivery back over Jadeja’s head for four more. 57th over: Australia 199-2 (Labuschagne 57, Smith 19) I’m not sure Rohit would have reviewed that if the score was, say, 50 for 2. It was on the desperate side of optimistic. Smith is not out! Smith shuffled a long way across, missed a flick to leg and was hit on the knee roll. But it was doing too much and would have missed leg stump, so India are down to their last review. India review for LBW against Smith! Deep has another huge LBW shout turned down, but this time Rohit goes upstairs. My hunch is umpire’s call on line, though it’s really close. 56th over: Australia 197-2 (Labuschagne 56, Smith 19) Labuschagne, who is batting with increasing fluency, glides Jadeja for two and then spanks an inside-out drive to the extra-cover boundary. Lovely batting. India have got problems. 55th over: Australia 190-2 (Labuschagne 50, Smith 18) Akash Deep, on for Bumrah, has a big LBW shout against Smith first ball. It’s turned down by Joel Wilson and Rohit Sharma declines a review because of height. It was pretty close, mind, and would have been umpire’s call had they gone upstairs. Smith takes seven from two deliveries later in the over, flicking to fine leg and driving three more through extra cover. Labuschagne fiddles a couple through the slips to reach a vital, hard-fought fifty from 114 balls. Australia are in such a good position here. 54th over: Australia 181-2 (Labuschagne 48, Smith 11) Labuschagne sets the agenda for the evening session by running down the track to slap Jadeja over mid-on for four. While it’s too early to be talking about a 12th Test hundred, he does look comfortable out there. The players are back out there. It’ll be an extended evening session, with 37 overs still to be bowled. Ravindra Jadeja will take care of the first. Teatime reading A cracking piece here from Jack Snape on a debut innings like no other. More than anything, Konstas had belied expectation. On debut, against Bumrah, in the first session on Boxing Day, it should be not be possible to play the way Konstas did. He charged down the pitch to Siraj short of a length, cut a middle stump-bound yorker for four, and produced more ramps than Arisa Trew’s backyard. 53rd over: Australia 176-2 (Labuschagne 44, Smith 10) Finally, on the stroke of tea, Washington Sundar comes on to bowl. He starts around the wicket with a slip, leg slip and short leg. Labuschagne is beaten by a good delivery that zips across him from round the wicket, then strides forward to drive classily to the long-off boundary. That’s the end of a good session for Australia, who consolidated the work of Sam Konstas by scoring 64 runs in 28 overs for the loss of Usman Khawaja. India’s tiring bowlers are facing the prospect of a Headache in the evening session. 52nd over: Australia 171-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 9) It feels like Australia have weathered the brief storm that followed Khawaja’s unexpected dismissal. Jadeja, who is bowling accurately but with little help from the pitch, is milked for three singles. 51st over: Australia 168-2 (Labuschagne 39, Smith 7) Labuschagne and Smith are taking no risks against Bumrah, unlike Sam Konstas earlier in the day. I’m wary of recency bias but all but we’ll surely reflect on that as one of the most audacious debut innings ever played. Kevin Pietersen dumping Glenn McGrath back over his head for six comes to mind, but he was 25, not 19. Ashton Agar’s 98 was awesome in a different way. 50th over: Australia 165-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 6) Smith mistimes a pull off Jadeja but it beats Sundar at mid-on and runs away for four. Just under ten minutes to go until tea; as things stand it’s Australia’s session. 49th over: Australia 161-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 2) Bumrah snaps an absolute jaffa past Labuschagne’s outside edge. Kohli appealed from slip but nobody else was interested. This is a good spell for India, who are building some pressure, and Australia will be happy to get to tea without losing any more wickets. A yorker from wide on the crease is jabbed into the ground and over gully for a couple by Labuschagne, who flicks two more behind square to end the over. 48th over: Australia 157-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 2) Smith drives Jadeja for a couple to get off the mark. “Always love the almost poetic description we get from you,” writes Mark in Cleveland, though I should stress he’s talking about Geoff rather than me. “This piece from earlier only needed a tweak to become a first innings Haiku. Khawaja this time. Stretching for a ball, to slip? Again, Deep sorrow. 47th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Bumrah tries an elaborate off-break that is defended by Labuschagne, then walks back to his mark smiling at anything and everything. Geniuses are rarely as happy-go-lucky as Bumrah. Another maiden ends with Labuschagne edging a good one short of slip. Labuschagne has slowed down as his innings has progressed: 21 from the first 43 balls, 13 from the next 47. 46th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Jadeja is bowling very straight to the right-handers as usual, with a slip and short leg in place. Labuschagne waves a quick single to mid-off and Smith defends the last two balls. 45th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 0) That’s such a bonus for India, especially as Bumrah is at the start of his spell and could do some game-changing damage. The new batter Steve Smith nicks his fourth ball on the bounce to second slip, a lovely delivery that squared him up. A wicket maiden. “T20 has ruined Test cricket,” writes Simon T. “Should’ve seen off the new ball with solid defensives or (preferably) studious leaves. Good luck to the young fella but I’ve hardly settled in to my salmon sarnies &amp; Chardonnay…” Jasprit Bumrah strikes with the first ball of a new spell! It was a rancid delivery, short on leg stump, but Khawaja was through his pull shot too early and toe-ended it in slow motion to midwicket. Bumrah puts his hands over his face in mock-embarrassment. All those snorters he bowled this morning and he gets a wicket with that. 44th over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne dances down to Jadeja, is nowhere near the pitch and switches to a defensive stroke. A maiden. 43rd over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne times Siraj sweetly through mid-off, the first boundary in eight overs, anf dollows up with a clip through midwicket for three. Australia are in such a good position, one that would have been unimaginable this morning when seven of the first 10 deliveries went past the outside edge. 42nd over: Australia 146-1 (Khawaja 56, Labuschagne 26) Labuschagne waves Jadeja inside out for a couple to extend this methodical second-wicket partnership to 57. This is such a great opportunity for Australia to take control of the match and series. Perth is starting to seem forever ago. 41st over: Australia 143-1 (Khawaja 55, Labuschagne 24) Khawaja, who is back in his bubble after three difficult Tests, flicks Siraj for another single. Labuschagne drops another on the off side and Khawaja flicks a third to fine leg., Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy, ostensibly picked as bowling allrounders, have bowled two overs between them. If India lose this series they will lament some peculiar selections. That said, they are desperately missing Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Shami. “A decade or so ago there was a lot of online action around watermelon boy,” writes Pete. “Has there been another fruit-based crowd hero since? I’ll be on the lookout from my couch today.” He’s not among the crowd but Sam Konstas blew a few raspberries in India’s direction. 40th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Jadeja spits one past Labuschagne, who was beaten more by the bounce than the turn as he tried to cut. He decides to take precisely no risks for the remainder of the over. “Christmas Day here in North Carolina,” write Alex and Katelyn. “The first time I told my half-Swedish, half-American partner I loved her was during an Australia-Pakistan match last year and we are freshly engaged sitting down to watch a spot of today’s action. No sound on, as a compromise.” That’s really rather lovely. Congratulations! 39th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Khawaja flicks Siraj through square leg for a single; Labuschagne steals another on the off side. You never know with such things but it does feel like Konstas deserves an assist for some of these runs; from an Australian batting perspective, his innings has changed the mood of the whole series. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Any chance we can pause this match and relive Sam Konstas’s knock again? There have been something like 91,515 innings played in Test cricket; few, if any, were as eye-catchingly unique as Konstas’s 60. 38th over: Australia 138-1 (Khawaja 52, Labuschagne 22) The medium mediums of Nitish Kumar Reddy frighten nobody, especially when he bowls a bouncer that Labuschagne happily ducks, genuflecting. Wendy Cowling has finished off dinner recently. “Mixture of fruity and nutty Christmas pudding with top-quality vanilla ice cream - was a great success, although a brother-in-law poked at his serving after the first spoonful and in a suspicious voice said: ‘I think this has spices in it.’” Mystifies me how some people live their lives afraid of any food that isn’t a petrol station sausage roll. Drinks break. From here, your guide will be Rob Smyth. Please direct to him your emails, and hopefully he’s not blocked from his inbox by a rogue workplace router. 37th over: Australia 137-1 (Khawaja 51, Labuschagne 22) Siraj again, flying down the leg side. It feels like with Konstas having made the runs, these two can just squash the life out of India’s fast bowlers, then the rest can come in and profit. Trouble looming for India if they don’t break this pairing soon. Siraj settles for trying to break Labuschagne’s pair, again zeroing in on the testicles. If only someone hung a box on middle stump, Siraj might bowl full enough to hit it. 36th over: Australia 136-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 22) Very late in the piece, India’s fourth seamer has a shot. Innocuous first offering in the 120s. 35th over: Australia 134-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 21) Struck again by Siraj is Labuschagne, though this time mercifully it misses the box and hits more thigh. It draws an error to follow, a top-edged hook shot that lands safe and picks up four runs fine. It’s all going Australia’s way today, aside from the nut shots. Then a couple to square, and another near collision as Labuschagne dashes a single and clips Siraj, who gives him a long look. “Is Marnus channeling Wally Grout here?” asks Greg Wood. “Don’t rub em, just count ‘em?” 34th over: Australia 123-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 14) Khawaja moves again, a lovely on drive from a rare overpitched Deep delivery. Rather more streaky as he reaches for a rising ball and slices it between slip and gully. Konstas reached fifty in 52 balls, Khawaja in almost twice as many. Neil Brandom is far from Melbourne. “It’s Christmas afternoon in Orange County, California. We get the sketchy Fox coverage through Willow. More importantly, your OBO alerts me to sneak away from our Christmas gathering (who know nothing of cricket) to watch highlights.” Tactical, I like it. 33rd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) Straight in the bowl of Jatz crackers there from Siraj, who is booed as he starts a new spell. Labuschagne the unlucky wearer of the contact, and he makes it two on two the next ball! This time he’s down for longer, on his knees on the pitch. He looks up to Siraj with a rueful smile, as if to say, would you mind aiming somewhere else? Good inward movement from Siraj, but if I may repeat a point, the length isn’t threatening the stumps. It’s only threatening a length. Labuschagne needs a physio visit after the second blow, really just to give him time for a drink and a breather while he pretends to have a chat. 32nd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) The nicks aren’t carrying. Khawaja this time, stretching for a ball, short of slip. Again, Deep sorrow. 31st over: Australia 118-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 13) An overstep for Bumrah in the over, his first of those today, though his rhythm is still good enough to get an edge from Labuschagne from a different ball. It doesn’t carry to slip though. “Slumped in front of the telly is the only way to spend Boxing Day. The swirling heat outside makes it even better, though that’s tempered by the thought of those facing a fire threat in western Victoria,” writes David Meiklejohn. “Question: is Kohli in trouble? Or are the conspiracy theorists (ICC=BCCI) right and he’ll get off with a light slap on the wrist?” Well, it’s not a conspiracy theory when it’s demonstrably true, as that contention is. The Indian board sets terms at ICC meetings and the others are financially obliged to accede. So, the chance of Kohli being suspended is non-existent. If he were to be, India would probably refuse to play in Sydney and CA would be out millions of dollars. He might get some demerit points. 30th over: Australia 116-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 12) Runs at last! Four of them, Khawaja getting a full piece of a pull shot off a fast bowler for the first time today. Out through midwicket. Thoroughly beaten on the next two balls though, trying to drive. Deep is coming around the wicket and seaming the ball away. Gosh, he’s been an unlucky bowler in this series. Beats Khawaja a third time, again forcing the rabbit hop on the crease. I can’t fathom how that movement helps the batter control a shot. Any batting coaches out there, drop us a line. 29th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Four maidens in a row. Labuschagne handles Bumrah watchfully but without any alarms in this over, trying to defend incoming balls to leg, trying to leave outside off. 28th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Deep is giving Khawaja a hard time. Another ball that beats him, another jumping fend at it. There is still enough there for the bowlers, but India can’t break through. Three overs since lunch, no run. 27th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Bumrah from the Shane Warne Stand End. Rides his little imaginary horse up to the crease, then catapults. Labuschagne gets one off the gloves trying to glance, then one towards gully trying to press. Another appeal for a leg-side catch but nobody except Bumrah thinks there was a touch. In fact that was miles from the glove. Rohit pretends to review and then pulls out, laughing. 26th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) We’re back with Akash Deep, and it’s another maiden, in that groove outside Khawaja’s off stump. The opener is still playing on his toes a lot of the time. Trying to catch up on a few emails. One from Ibby Usman, before the break. “That’s absolutely embarrassing from Kohli. 35 years old, tens of thousands of runs, however many centuries, and he’s shoulder barging a 19 year old, then playing the victim. Never thought I’d say this, but I wish Warner was out there when that happened.” I generally try not to make assumptions about what players are thinking, rather than doing, but it’s hard to see how Kohli could have been genuinely surprised by the contact after walking towards the other player. We’re about to resume after lunch. It’s still hot and still cloudy in Melbourne. India need to find a way to get some equilibrium back after that break. Shiona Biswas is feeling upbeat. “It’s a working holiday season for me albeit while also spending time with old friends. Having grown up on the other side of the world in India, tuning in to the Boxing Day test brings me extra cheer today.” Glad to hear that. What a session. A hundred runs in it, Australia already on top, and it came from an injection of what could be deemed audacity or foolishness, depending on your view, that was undeniably allied with a lot of skill. Sam Konstas said that he would take on Bumrah and take on India, and he did: scooping, ramping, reversing, charging, all of the above. It won’t always work, and it very nearly didn’t work a number of times here, but it got him a score and it got Australia the impetus. Now they have a big advantage on which to build a lead. 25th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Two more for Khawaja off the outside edge, he’s building a handy score here. He needs one, and it needs to be bigger than this. It’s still cloudy at the G, as Bumrah gets bounce and Khawaja fends it away, lucky that it goes to ground. The clock ticks past lunch time. Khawaja glances a run. Bumrah appeals for a leg-side catch from Labuschagne, but no dice. And that’s that. 24th over: Australia 109-1 (Khawaja 35, Labuschagne 12) Deep rolls back in, Labuschagne wristing two runs through midwicket. Khawaja drives what should be one but Siraj misfields at mid off, conceding three. “In all of the Konstas hype, can we not add that he is debuting in the city with the largest Greek population outside Greece, and about the sixth or seventh largest with Greece included? I hope everyone is raising a spanakopita to him in Melissa’s Cafe, Smith Street, my first stop every time I am in Melbourne.” We can add that, Peter Salmon, this is an open forum. Wait, that’s Roman. Lucky I’m not agora phobic. We did a homemade spanakopita for Christmas lunch, it was top notch. 23rd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Bumrah back for a quick burst before lunch, maybe two overs, and he’s nasty immediately. Two balls in a row leaping at Khawaja’s gloves, played off the handle almost as the batter flinches. Then pad, but via an inside edge. No run from the over. Sam Konstas is down at the edge of the player’s race signing shirts and taking selfies. Why not? The crowd wave is circling the ground. Atmosphere here is top notch. 22nd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Jadeja to Labuschagne, a deft late cut brings four runs. Next ball, another one, finer! Bumping up the scoreboard close to lunch. I’ve finally worked out how to route some emails off my phone through about three other intermediaries to have them show up as text messages. Every other website at the MCG is blocked, somehow. Anyway, here’s an expert on my opening subject: his name is Russell Yule. “My great-great grandfather emigrated from a Scandinavian state a while back to England before my great grandfather emigrated to Queensland in the early 1900s. Our family name was changed to ‘Yule’ because the original ‘Juïlle’ wasn’t, ahem, gaining traction, so great granddad went with a phonetic spelling. My understanding is that the Yule log was a large log that had been chosen based on its ability to burn for a long time. This was to celebrate a Pagan winter solstice celebration in the long hall where the party would last as long as the log was burning. Generally it was considered poor form if the log burnt out in less than 8 days. If you’re snowbound for a while, you might as well enjoy it… There are some sacrifices to be made. The Yule Goat (or reindeer buck) was a big part of the celebration in order to safeguard the New Year harvest. There was also a pig sacrifice as well but since the wet blankets at head office decided that sacrificing live animals was not okay, sacrifices were made. Smaller Yule Goat ornaments are now made from straw, (and apparently available from Ikea!), which burns well. It is a common game to try to sneak a Yule Goat ornament under a neighbouring friend or family Yule tree. Once discovered the game is to sneak it on to someone else’s Yule tree. Oh those wacky Scandos! The Yule ‘Pigs’ are now often made from the corn meal from the last ear of corn from the previous harvest. A pig head is baked from the cornmeal and rather than being even is broken up and spread over the corn field to promote a prosperous harvest. There is also a Yule Cat that decides, based on whether children get new clothes or not, if children have been good/worthy of presents. The thinking being that only good children would get new clothes. There’s a thought that bad children would then be offered to the Yule Cat who would spirit them away. Possibly based on the very real fact that children who didn’t get new clothes wouldn’t survive the winter.” 21st over: Australia 92-1 (Khawaja 29, Labuschagne 1) Some leaving, a run, a leg bye, another quiet Deep over. Super weird seeing players just carry on like the game is normal, after that opening stand. It’s like the awkward resumption of conversation after a fight at family Christmas when the offending parties have been ushered outside. 20th over: Australia 90-1 (Khawaja 28, Labuschagne 1) Normal service resumes, then, with two of Australia’s regulars in the middle. Oh, what a piece of bowling from Jadeja! Just as I was thinking about Australian tons on debut, about Ponting’s 96, and all that stuff. Around the wicket, down the line of the stumps, drawing a big forward defensive lunge from Konstas. The ball straightens just enough to beat the edge and strikes his back leg. Konstas doesn’t bother reviewing. Immense ovation for the young player as he walks off though, and the MCG gives you a long runway to keep soaking up that applause. He was chancy, he was dramatic, and he found his own unique way to nullify the threat of a Bumrah opening spell. 19th over: Australia 89-0 (Konstas 60, Khawaja 28) Three more for Konstas, driving Deep at the top of the bounce out through cover. “Are middle aged men allowed to swoon?” a friend messages me. 18th over: Australia 86-0 (Konstas 57, Khawaja 28) Jadeja goes through Konstas, past the bat, but the ball is just too far down leg. Umpire says no and it’s a good call. Jadeja agrees, eventually, and that’s a good call too. Konstas drives a run, then gets the strike back, and drives another. Seems to have settled down from his early adrenaline rush. 17th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Another drinks break, in the heat. India have been thoroughly disconcerted, it must be said. You could see Kohli speaking to teammates after that collision complaining the Konstas had put a shoulder into him, miming a big shoulder movement coming forward. But Kohli is the one who made a beeline close to the other player. I’m sure there’ll be much more about that later. Konstas does the remote camera interview at the drinks break, but won’t say anything about the bump when asked. Akash Deep resumes after the break, and gets through a maiden over in the channel outside Khawaja’s off stump. Three overs for five runs, he has. Siraj meanwhile has gone at 4.8 an over, and Bumrah at 6.3. 16th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Spin, at last. Jadeja to Khawaja though, I want to see what Konstas does against slow bowling. Presumably he’ll try to murder it. No need though, as Khawaja pulls the second ball for four. It wasn’t short, but Khawaja gets down very low with a straight front leg to manufacture the length and get power through his shot. Punches one off the back foot. 15th over: Australia 78-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 22) Again, Deep makes things slow down a bit. Bowls most of the over to Khawaja. One run from a top edged pull. 14th over: Australia 77-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 21) A remarkable morning. It’s not even midday yet, and the kid has 50 at almost a run a ball. He’s taken down the biggest threat by treating him like a T20 bowler. Gets there with an inside squeeze to leg, and he makes Khawaja work those twilight-of-a-career legs to race back for two. Salutes the crowd, then follows up by slotting Siraj for a monster pull shot over the longest part of the ground. Just lands inside the rope. He’s done that a lot today. Hopefully the memory of that gives him some solace as he gets his box crushed next ball. 13th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 48, Khawaja 20) We get a brief pause for breath, as Konstas faces four balls from Akash Deep but elects to have a little look at him before trying anything. 12th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 47, Khawaja 17) More Siraj. Try a spinner, surely? Khawaja tucks one, Konstas flays a cut shot to deep third for two. Misses a hook shot at a bouncer. 11th over: Australia 62-0 (Konstas 45, Khawaja 16) It’s official, Konstas is winning the battle. He’s got Bumrah into a sixth over in this heat, he’s just had an earful from Kohli, and he smokes an off drive for four! Finally a normal shot, and an imposing one. Feeling good about that, he smacks one over long on for six! Reaches for it outside off stump, again the length is fuller, and he gets the length to land it on the rope just around from the old Bay 13. Four more! T20 shot again, backs away and squirts the full straight ball away through backward point this time. Then opens his stance again and tries to pound more over long off, this one mistimed for two runs. This is absolutely extraordinary. He’s taken 18 off that Bumrah over after 14 off an over earlier. Nathan McSweeney would have done the same. 10th over: Australia 44-0 (Konstas 27, Khawaja 16) Early drinks break. Apologies I haven’t got to any emails, the internet connection at the ground has somehow torpedoed access to that server while allowing everything else. I’ll just have to believe that they were witty, erudite, and insightful. I can imagine a bunch of confused late-night English readers trying to work out how Zak Crawley is playing for Australia: tall, right-handed, and throwing the bat without concern. Konstas plays through cover for a couple, then charges Siraj and belts back a drive that hits the bowler. Again Siraj has a few words and the crowd get on his back. Kohli doesn’t say anything, skipping down level with the batter to field, but looks at him with what I would interpret as contempt. Konstas doesnt’ mind, charging again to belt a cut shot for four! Then pulls, splices, high over the leg side for one, into a gap. Huh, now Kohli really is getting into Konstas. They bump shoulders at the end of the over, Kohli walking beside the pitch towards Siraj. Kohli moves his line partly but not enough, perhaps expecting Konstas to do the same. They clip quite forcefully, then Kohli turns to give the young player an earful. Khawaja comes up and shoos Kohli away, Umpire Gough gets involved as well. Boiling over. 9th over: Australia 37-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 16) Change in the field for the bouncer, Bumrah to Konstas. Deep square leg, deep fine leg, deep third set quite fine. Two slips, gully, point. Konstas is clueless to the ball cutting in, but it goes too far to leg before hitting his pad. Then he edges on just short of slip! Kohli diving across can’t get it. Skews a single through square leg and gets off strike. Bumrah’s first crack at Khawaja and he immediately goes past the left-hander’s edge. But Khawaja gets the last ball of the over off his pads for four, behind square. Nicely timed. 8th over: Australia 32-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 12) Still digesting this. Bumrah’s over went for 14. It’s not like he was collared though. I wouldn’t say that Konstas hit any of those scoop shots flush, or that it seems a viable long-term strategy. But he’s shaken things up. Khawaja pulls three more from Siraj, Konstas gets one off an inside edge, Khawaja drives two. Runs flowing. 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Konstas 19, Khawaja 7) Finally, Konstas connects with his scoop shot! Not completely cleanly, it takes the inside portion and goes much straighter than intended, over the keeper more than fine leg. And it trickles to the rope rather than racing. But he does get four. And goes again! For six! That one is cleaner, and it’s a reverse. Absurd shot. Bumrah has had enough and goes for the yorker. It’s a pretty good one, tailing in at off stump. But Konstas is either expecting it, or is fast enough to adapt. He gets in position, has the bat down for the full pitch, then seeing the line, falls with his body towards the leg side rather than continuing to the off, and opens the face to hit it very fine over deep third. It carries the rope by a few inches. Third ball, charges and tries to flat bat through cover, misses. Fourth ball, leaves. Fifth ball, plays the same reverse scoop to another full ball, and it lands just short of the rope. Replay says four, not six. This is utterly absurd. 6th over: Australia 12-0 (Konstas 5, Khawaja 7) Siraj to Khawaja, across him. It’s been a tale of two battles so far, all of Khawaja down one end and Konstas down the other. Khawaja has soft hands as he runs one into the gully, no score. Finally the ends change, as Khawaja pulls without timing it, clunking three through square, and Kinstas will face Siraj for the first time. Smashes his pad first ball. Was there an inside edge? Guess not, the ball lands with the cordon. Konstas follows up with a huge charge and swing! Baseball style, aimed nowhere and everywhere, and fresh air again. Siraj doesn’t much enjoy that audacity, and has some words. The big screen flashes a close-up of him speaking and the crowd immediately razzes him. But Konstas gets a score to follow, three runs through square leg on the flick. Australia double their score that over. 5th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) The Bumrah-Konstas show resumes, and the new guy tries the scoop again! This ball was even less the one for it, fuller but wide of the off stump. The bat is nowhere near it. Rohit chuckles, Kohli just shakes his head in mild disapproval. You can’t bat like that after two career runs, buddy, he seems to be thinking. Bumrah ends the over by nearly bursting through, taking a sliver of bat onto the other player’s foot. 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) What do you know – an incorrect review with Siraj’s encouragement. The ball does bend in to the left-hander and smash Khawaja on the pad, but it’s near the knee roll and he’s on the march towards the bowler. Always going over, but India burn one early to see the green light. Siraj at least turned to the umpire eventually, after running down level with the batsman first. Then swings one down leg side, and Khawaja gets a little inside feather on it to fine leg for four. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 0) Huge ovation for Konstas with his first Test runs, getting a straighter ball from Bumrah that he can stab off his pads through square leg for two. Then plays a very clunky forward defence and gets bat on ball again. Bumrah could be bowling fuller, everything so far is over the stumps. He’s enjoying the contest though, smiling at Konstas every couple of balls, as if to say, I can work you out, young feller. So Konstas plays the scoop! Eleventh ball of his Test career, against the best quick in the world. And misses. The ball goes over his off bail. A bit fuller… Bumrah walks back chuckling and shaking his head. And last ball of the over, beats him again! 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) Now then, India need quality from the other end. Some support for Bumrah. It did start to come in Brisbane, before the last-day rain. Siraj with the new Kooka, and he does beat Khawaja with a good one, Khawaja playing on the top as he has done so often while getting out this series. And again, fourth ball, sparring, kangaroo style, bounce and movement. Khawaja survives the over. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) There’s a real good lip curl from Konstas on the close-up cam, waiting for Bumrah. The crowd hushes in anticipation… and sighs as he leaves the ball. A big jerky action, shouldering arms over the top of the ball and pulling his bat around to face back down the pitch. Plays and misses at the next one, a pearler that goes away off the pitch. Bumrah doing heaps early. Draws another leave third ball, but the fourth and the fifth are lovely. Beaten, beaten again, both times drawing Konstas into the defensive shot before seaming past the edge. Perfect seam position, upright then scrambling away. And the sixth ball same again! Just misses the edge. Bumrah excited, but doesn’t go through with his appeal. Didn’t bowl an in-ducker in that over, I wonder if he’s going for an extended setup. Konstas beats Khawaja to the middle by about 150 metres. Runs out there and regards the pitch. The young and the old. Anthems go around the ground. We’re not full yet, but well on the way to full. Mitch Starc has had a haircut. Boland has too. Marsh and Konstas have not, by the looks. The Torres Strait and Aboriginal flags fly on poles between the larger Australian and Indian national flags, which are held flat like bedsheets ready to be folded. Done, away we go. And a big piece of news about India’s XI. I wasn’t expecting this. Gill is out so they can play two spinners, with Jadeja at six. Rohit goes up to three. Australia Usman Khawaja Sam Konstas Marnus Labuschagne Steve Smith Travis Head Mitch Marsh Alex Carey Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Nathan Lyon Scott Boland India Yashasvi Jaiswal KL Rahul Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant Ravindra Jadeja Nitish Kumar Reddy Washington Sundar Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Akash Deep Weather report from the ground: it is already hot out there, but it’s currently cloudy. So that’s some measure of relief at least. I suspect it will burn away soon, although there’s also a chance of rain in the forecast and a cool change later. The whole Melbourne grab-bag. I’ll tell you what is certain: Indian support. My word, the crowd outside is at least half wearing blue India shirts. Huge lines on the way in. Huge toss to win! No surprises there, with the heat and the gusty winds blowing across Melbourne. Tell us about your day, whether you’re at the end of it on one half of the planet, or it is already yesterday on the other. Who ate what? Who annoyed who? Who is filled with seasonal cheer? Get salty, get schmaltzy, get smoochy – whatever you like. The email line is open. Here’s our lead-in piece on Konstas and his forerunner, Ricky Ponting. The biggest news for Australia is the debut of young sensation Sam Konstas to open the batting. Huge challenge for him, especially if he’s called upon immediately. Although that would give him less time to get nervous, I suppose. He seems pretty confident, but walking out in front of 90,000 would have to challenge any teenage bravado. Scott Boland is coming back for Australia replacing the injured Josh Hazlewood. Not sure what India will do yet, they always play their cards close and always seem to make a change somewhere along the line. Happy tidings of the Yule. Now that I think about it, I’ve never thought to check what Yule means. Yuletide could be the guy from The King and I doing an album of Vance Joy covers. Regardless, what with all of those logs and whatnot, I’m going to assume that most people had a festive time. In most of Australia, Christmas was stinking hot, in the UK it’s been cold and bleh to a moderate sort of level, and wherever else you were in the world, it was something else. Or still is something else, for those on the negative side of Greenwich Mean. Whatever the case, it is Boxing Day in Melbourne, and that means one thing. We are about to send 13 players and two umpires into the middle of the MCG to suffer in ridiculous heat all day. In Melbourne the temperature didn’t drop out of the 20s all night, it will be into the 30s by the time the toss takes place, and it will be up towards 40 degrees by the end of the afternoon. The following days will cool off. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure the ICC doesn’t have an extreme heat policy, even though the world is getting hotter. Cricket Australia does have one, where something called the Heat Stress Risk Index can be calculated to theoretically suspend games if it gets hot enough. But at this level of heat they usually just have extra drink breaks. So, on we go. Safe to say this is a bat-first day, even though the MCG has become the best bowling pitch in the country after they renovated it for being too flat."

          "bodyText": "I can see why kids who find themselves at a holiday shack where the only screen-based entertainment is an old TV would be perplexed. By the time you explain all the things the remote “control” doesn’t do, all you’re left with is a limited number of viewing options at any given time, and no control over when each starts or stops. In the age of smartphones and streaming, you could call it “dumb TV”. Or you could sell it as unique, novel, a game: “surprise TV”. I don’t know who in our family started calling it this, only that the name stuck, and provided you don’t consult a TV guide (“a what?”) or watch enough to know when a certain show will come on, that’s what it delivers. We’ve developed a tradition when on holidays to live dangerously: to leave modern devices behind, throw caution to the wind and surrender to surprise TV. When we’re at home, it’s not uncommon for each child to spend their allocated screen time on a different device, often in a different “world”. When there’s just one TV and no streaming services, they’re either bored together or they’re engaged together. Sometimes, a new show will be discovered and prove all the more enjoyable because it was unexpected; at other times, the lack of choice fosters a new ability to find entertainment elsewhere. It’s not that I want to go back to “the olden days” where all TV was surprise TV. I’m a fan of watching and listening to what I want, when I want – podcasts in particular are great for this. I love the ease with which I can find interesting people talking about interesting topics; it’s led to much post-university learning. But sometimes I’m conscious of a nagging feeling that I might be missing out on opportunities to broaden my interests, develop new ones or expose myself to a greater range of perspectives. It’s one of the reasons why, in the brief pockets of time I spend driving every week, I listen to “surprise radio”. The content is curated, but not by me. Some of the shows that come on aren’t those I’d normally choose – talkback radio, for example – but that doesn’t mean I won’t get something out of them. In fact, I very often do. It was in the spirit of exiting my comfort bubble that I first agreed to attend “The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever”: an annual event where Kate Bush fans mark her birthday by recreating the film clip to her song Wuthering Heights. If my friend had invited me on April Fools’ Day, I’d have assumed she’d made the whole thing up – but it was July. I like Kate Bush’s music – well, what I’ve heard of it – but I wasn’t familiar with the dance, and even if I had been, I’m no dancer. Picture someone who’s a natural; now picture the opposite: that’s me. And yet, dancing through laughter on a grassy hill with a friend and a bunch of strangers, all wearing outfits that more or less resembled the one the singer donned in the music video (mostly less), was, in a word, joyful. I was an ignorant impostor compared with the diehard fans, but received as warm a welcome as anyone. It wasn’t my thing. I can’t imagine any algorithm recommending it to me based on my event history, or viewing or watching history. But when it was on again the following year, I couldn’t wait to go again. Maybe it was my thing, or at least, is now. Much has been written about echo chambers and polarisation, perhaps less about how we can open ourselves up to new discoveries and surprise ourselves. We all have assumptions about what we could or couldn’t appreciate, enjoy or find interesting; agree with, or disagree with. How often do we challenge them? Once accustomed to certain technological advances, it isn’t easy to revert to older ways, but it can be done. Less curated entertainment might be more likely to result in boredom than delight, but once in a while, it’s a risk I’m willing to take. If you’re about to set off for a holiday somewhere that doesn’t have all the mod-cons, maybe now’s the time. Yes, you might end up with nothing worth watching. But what’s the worst that can happen? You turn off the TV? End up outside? Go on, I dare you! Leave choice behind, or rather, choose surprise. • Emma Wilkins is a Tasmanian journalist whose freelance work has appeared in newspapers, magazines and literary journals in Australia and beyond"

          "bodyText": "I’m writing this from a room that’s slowly orbiting the Earth. Behind the floating screen in front of me, through a giant opening where a wall should be, the planet slowly spins, so close that it takes up most of my field of vision. It’s morning in Australia to my right; India and the first hints of Europe are dotted with lights up and to my left. The soft drone of the air circulation system hums quietly behind me. I spent a week doing everything that I could – working, exercising, composing – on my virtual reality headset. This was the year virtual reality threatened to go mainstream, with prices becoming more attainable and Apple entering the market, and so I wanted to see how far VR has come since I first tried it in the mid-2010s, when the main experiences on offer were nausea-inducing rollercoaster simulators. I used a recent model from Meta, called the Quest 3, and the conclusion was clear: this thing now works. It feels a little unfinished, but we’ve reached the point where VR could at last become genuinely useful. The biggest surprise was working in VR. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Donning a headset, you can summon multiple screens, all connected to your computer, make them as large as you want, and place them anywhere in your environment. “Passthrough” – the ability to see digital objects superimposed on the real world, made possible with cameras built into the front of the headset – means you can carve out a window from the virtual environment to see your keyboard. And you can choose between any number of environments to work in, from minimalist cafes to mountain lodges, switching between them at will. I’ve rapidly got to the stage where, if I’m working on my own, I’d rather work in virtual reality than in reality. The main problem is a general lack of polish. The headset doesn’t quite feel like a finished product. It’s perhaps 10% too heavy, like a lab prototype that’s yet to be refined. The battery won’t get you through anything like an entire day. Every so often, the controllers disconnect without explanation. I took it on a plane to do some work, but the challenge of connecting it to my laptop using the in-flight wifi proved insurmountable. But watching a film in VR during the flight was nothing short of extraordinary. Yes, I felt a very British need to apologise to my neighbour – wearing a headset in public hasn’t yet reached socially acceptable status. As soon as I hit play, though, I knew it would be difficult ever to go back to in-flight entertainment. I was sitting in a cinema, lights dimmed, a few tiered rows of seats separating me from a huge screen on a virtual wall. In long spells without turbulence, I genuinely forgot we were flying. If there was one downside, it’s that I was so immersed that I nearly missed the breakfast cart coming past. The cinema, of course, was empty apart from me – by design. Other apps are not so intentionally sparsely populated. I downloaded one that promised live virtual concerts. Entering the virtual lobby, I found there were no concerts on, nor sign of any planned. No matter: it also offered a space where you could socialise when no acts were playing. I loaded it up. It was a beautifully designed virtual world, all domes and arches and curving ramps. But it was a ghost town. I was the only one there. And this is an app that the internet thinks is one of the most popular for live music. When people think of VR, they often picture Ready Player One, the sci-fi novel and film about a world in which people spend most of their time in a shared virtual reality: congregating there as avatars, mixing, talking, watching sports or music together. This feels a long way off. There are games that give hints of this collective experience, such as Gorilla Tag, where kids congregate after school and play tag as a gorilla, chatting to each other and swinging their arms to move. But VR adoption just isn’t broad enough yet for the Ready Player One vision to become reality. Today, the key to making the most of VR – if you’re not a gamer – is using it for activities you do on your own. Work, at least for a certain kind of knowledge worker, is one such activity – and one that someone deeply embedded in the industry recently told me they’re seeing as the fastest-growing use-case. It feels easier to be productive in VR. The clutter of your office is gone, replaced by whichever calming environment takes your fancy that day. Monitors that in the real world would cost thousands of dollars appear before you on demand. As a place to sit at my keyboard and write music, a virtual forest in the mountains is infinitely preferable to the grey walls of my study. All distractions recede from view. Another is exercise. I had a personal training session in my garden, a virtual trainer hovering in the air in front of me. Passthrough, which was only added to the Quest recently, is critical here, since it means you can use weights – not a sensible idea on previous models that completely obscured the real world. It seems reasonable to hope that on-demand personal training in my home might get me regularly exercising where so many fleeting gym memberships have failed. The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset earlier this year was meant to be the starting gun for VR. It wasn’t. It is an engineering marvel, magical to use – but it doesn’t yet have enough compelling apps, and the £3,500 price tag rules it out for most people. Stories of headsets gathering dust or being returned have led some to think VR is little more than another hype bubble from a tech industry desperate to find the next big thing. But VR is not hype. There are kinks to smooth out, sure. But I think we’ve hit a tipping point. If you embrace it as something single-player – and something you’re not going to be using much in public – it is genuinely useful. Work, entertainment, exercise – all are fantastic in VR already. Don’t count on small, rectangular screens being how humanity communicates with machines for ever.

          "bodyText": "The year was 2020 and Christmas itself hung in the balance. We had spent the last nine months in and out of Covid lockdowns. Initially, we had reacted with total diligence, united in fear and grief. But then we entered into an interminable hokey-cokey of being allowed out, then back in, then a bit out, then a bit in again. Obligatory scotch eggs was a particularly low point. By winter, the rules had become confusing and often felt unfollowable. Nevertheless, hope prevailed. We hadn’t seen our extended families for so long and the government promised that Christmas would not be cancelled. Christmas always feels a bit “high stakes”, even in normal times, but this one had been dialled up to 11. The extended absences from family meant we missed them all to bits. Also, my son was five – a peak age for enjoying yuletide business. I co-parent with my son’s dad (my ex) and, as luck would have it, it was my turn to have my son on Christmas Day. We were going to stay with my parents in Dorset and it felt like it had to be a good one. I’m a planner at heart, so the slight uncertainty was making a monster of me. I held my horses as best I could and waited until mid-December to let myself buy presents for everyone I was going to see. I also began to empty the fridge of perishable food, ready for our big adventure. Cut to 20 December when it was announced that, actually, none of us were going anywhere. Reader, I was raging. After some quick discussions around how to best protect the “specialness” of the following week for the child in our lives, we decided to have Christmas at home: me, my son, my girlfriend and my ex. All together, in one room, all day, just us. It felt like the emotional equivalent of throwing a packet of Mentos into a two-litre bottle of Coke. My ex lived locally and was already in my Covid “bubble” – this wasn’t our own private Partygate – but the relationship dynamic of “not‑with-him-but-with-her” was only a year old. The setup was very much still a work in progress. What could possibly go wrong? To everyone’s surprise, though, we all got on like a house on fire. Discovering that Christmas could be done in our own way – without being beholden to the whims of our elders – felt freeing. At Christmas, my family usually likes to drink hard and eat late. It sounds great, but when dinner keeps slipping, from 4pm to 6pm to 8pm, you are already hungover by the time the turkey appears. Attempting to enjoy a massive feast in a state of fugue from a day fuelled by snacks, booze and anticipation is nigh on impossible. Add children to that mix and you are guaranteed a few tears, too. My ex came from the opposite kind of Christmas tradition: his was a day full of extreme formality and militarily precise timings, where every year is identical to the last: dinner at 13.06, followed by one hour and 47 minutes of brutal parlour games. Add children to that mix and you are guaranteed a few tears, too. They used to play pass the parcel, but, instead of prizes within the layers, there were dares. One year, I witnessed an aunt deliberately pause the music so that her son-in-law would receive the dare of “walk around the table like a dog”. Left to our own devices, we discontinued these traditions. Instead, we made new ones, including: slow, easy, team-effort cooking; board games and gifts and then more board games; breaks for fresh air or exercise or baths or any other necessary moments of solitude. I also made a triumphant chestnut soup starter, which we all said we would happily eat every day for the rest of the year. In short, it was perfect. Until, that is, I went to fetch the turkey that had been resting in the kitchen, only to discover that one of the cats had got there first. Just to make his point, he had also dragged it around the kitchen floor. But I was still far less angry with the cat than I was with Boris Johnson; he had never promised to behave in the first place. We made a real success out of our last-minute mess and it changed the course of our Christmas traditions for good. Now, instead of taking turns to take our son to our respective family homes, every third year we do this again. We have Christmas at home, just us – a mad, modern, muddled-together jumble of a family. So, 2020 was the year that Christmas that went right – in the end."

          "bodyText": "Anna Sawai is having a moment. In September, the erstwhile child actor and J-pop singer’s performance in the epic historical drama Shōgun netted her an Emmy for best female lead, making her the first actor of Asian descent to win in her category, and the first Japanese woman to win an Emmy at all. When Time magazine subsequently listed her in the Time100 Next 2024, her co-star Hiroyuki Sanada, who starred as future titular shōgun Yoshii Toranaga, penned an uncharacteristically glowing tribute: “Anna Sawai could play any role on this Earth, or in space,” he said. “Period pieces or far-future films – she is so talented that she can do anything.” “I teared up when I saw that,” Sawai says, speaking on Zoom from the Tokyo film set for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, Apple TV+’s foray into the Godzillaverse. “Hiro’s not someone to say something for the sake of it.” Shōgun follows a 17th-century Englishman who is shipwrecked off Japan’s coast and ends up in Lord Toranaga’s service. Sawai wields, in real life, both the beauty and the don’t-mess-with-me mettle that makes her portrayal of Mariko Toda, the lord’s interpreter and secret weapon (and said Englishman’s lover) so indelible. She’s also instantly warm and peaceful, with all the time in the world. On screen, she radiates impressive power – particularly during wordless internal struggles. I’ve spent months watching her battle entire battalions of ninja assassins (Ninja Assassin), leather-clad intruders (Fast &amp; Furious 9) and Bubble-economy finance bros (Pachinko), not to mention monsters (Monarch). In Shōgun, meanwhile, she steals the show in Crimson Sky, the penultimate episode widely hailed as the best TV anyone has watched in years, warding off regiments of samurai warriors and handing Toranaga victory without his opponents even realising they have been defeated. Her actual fighting skills are undeniable. “I started ballet at around six years old,” she explains. “It gave me a solid core – which you really need to be able to swing a sword that’s twice your height.” Mariko’s story has resonated with women far and wide. This tragic character stems from a long line of noble samurai. But like all women of her standing, she lives within social bounds as constricting as the layered silks she wears. Midway through the show, in a moment of rare candour, she speaks her mind to her lord: “A man may go to war for many reasons,” she says. “Conquest. Pride. Power. But a woman is simply at war.” What a line. “It’s so strange,” she tells me. “A lot of men compliment me on my portrayal of Mariko. It’s always like, ‘Oh, you’re amazing’ – it’s very positive.” But the response from Japanese and Asian women and girls has brought Sawai to tears. “I feel their pain,” she says. “It has made me realise how much some Japanese women don’t even realise they’re being treated a certain way. We’re very behind when it comes to equality for women. It shocked me that our show taught them that it was OK to stand up and say no.” It has also resonated with women living outside Japan. “They have been struggling, too, with expectations they need to meet. Of course, in Mariko’s time it was much more severe. But women really do need to do so much more in order to prove themselves.” Sawai says she hadn’t set out to make a statement about women’s rights. She just wanted the show to be as authentic as possible. “But I’ve come to realise that it’s a much bigger thing that we’re doing.” Shōgun is, without question, a big thing. It has beaten records for the most Emmy wins by a single show in a single year (18) and was the first non-English-language series to win best drama. It’s a world away from the 1980 TV adaptation of James Clavell’s eponymous novel – which focused so exclusively on sailor John Blackthorne’s white, western perspective that no one spoke Japanese – and has blown the doors off the industry in terms of how diversity ought really to be prioritised. But Sawai says she had little sense of the impact it would have while on set. “All I could do was just show up, do my best, then go home, take off my kimono and try to sleep.” Putting the kimono back on each day was a lot, she says. She would get really tense around the shoulders. But she saw that as a tool: “My posture would change: the way I walked into the room would be different. I would sit properly. I don’t think I would have been able to portray Mariko otherwise.” “I learned so much about Japanese culture that I would otherwise not have known,” she adds. One particular scene has stayed with her. Mariko and consort Fujiko head to the Willow World tea house, to negotiate – also at Toranaga’s request – with the brothel owner, Gin, over the price of Blackthorne’s forthcoming treat. That the three women are haggling is almost undetectable. They raise beautifully lacquered cups of green tea to their mouths, study them graciously then gently put them back down again. The experience of shooting the whole tea ceremony for this brief three-minute sequence settled something in Sawai’s mind. She was born in New Zealand in 1992. Her family moved around a lot thanks to her father’s job with an electrics company, before heading back to Japan when she was 10. “Growing up, knowing the outside culture and coming to Japan, I was a bit frustrated that people are not direct. But in that tea house when they flip over the cup and admire the bottom of it, just staring at the design, not saying anything to each other, I learned that that’s where we come from. It’s not a culture where we’re loud or constantly saying things to each other. It’s more about spending time in silence and just taking it in.” Just three years ago, when she got her first big international break with 2021’s Fast &amp; Furious 9, Sawai’s sister Reina, a ballet dancer, took to Instagram with a hug of a post: “There’s something so beautiful and admirable about working hard silently and tenaciously without bragging. And my sister is the perfect example of it. So I’m going to go ahead and brag for her.” Post-Shōgun, no one needs to brag for Sawai. “I feel like right now is a very good time for me. More people are showing interest in working with me.” She might direct. She is considering producing. She has ideas, not least the drama she experienced within the J-pop industry as a member of girl band Faky (which reportedly stood for “Five Ass Kicking Youngsters” and “FAntastic + toKYo” both). Listening back now, you note that Sawai can really sing. “People have asked me if I’ll ever release music. And I’m like: ‘Oh, no one wants to hear it.’ I’m probably a bit scared because I did try singing and it wasn’t a success. We were struggling as a group. So there’s a part of me that’s like: ‘You don’t belong, you’re not meant to sing.’” That’s another industry long criticised for its objectification of often very young girls. “Maybe I want to tell that story,” she says, “of being part of a group like that.” She would love to work with Palme d’Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda or Hiro Murai, whose credits include Atlanta, The Bear and Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. Murai’s directorial feature debut was recently announced as a samurai action movie set in feudal Japan. Given Shōgun, that might appear to have Sawai written all over it. But she is keen for casting directors to not make lazy choices. “I’ve played mostly just Japanese women. But I hope I’m not boxed into that kind of role. There will always be an ethnicity; I will always be this” – she gestures to her face – “but I’m just a human being. I can play a character who doesn’t have a specific country; I want to be able to go up for those roles as well. I will say, though: if I am to play a Japanese woman, I want it to be very properly authentic.” Judging by her successes so far, that doesn’t seem out of reach."

          "headline": "Machine to revive donor organs used in double-lung transplant in UK first",
          "bodyText": "Surgeons have performed a double-lung transplant using a novel machine which revives donor organs and keeps them alive and breathing outside the human body. The operation marked the first time the machine has been used in the UK. The pioneering device consists of a bubble-like chamber which contains a series of pumps and filters that repair, recondition and revitalise the lungs before they are transplanted into patients. Perfusion of the lungs in the machine allows doctors to evaluate and, if necessary, rehabilitate the organs for transplant. It also buys them significantly more time than the traditional method of storing lungs on ice, which can cause tissue damage. Experts say the machine’s arrival could dramatically increase the number of lungs available for transplant on the NHS, potentially saving hundreds of lives a year. Daniel Evans-Smith, 49, was the first patient in the UK to benefit from the XPS system, which is made by Xvivo. Before the operation at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge, Evans-Smith, an events manager, had developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition that causes breathing difficulties and can worsen over time, limiting daily activities and sometimes requiring the use of oxygen. After getting new lungs from a donor patient that were brought back to life using the XPS system, he woke up to find he no longer had COPD. “It’s amazing,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “The difference is phenomenal.” For more than five decades, the typical method for preserving lungs before transplantation was to cool them to just above freezing, slowing down their metabolic processes. This extends the window in which they can be transplanted, though only briefly. Once cooled, however, it is impossible to properly assess their quality. Because lung transplants are complex and life-changing operations, surgeons tend to refrain from using organs of uncertain quality. It means only one in five donated lungs worldwide end up being used. By giving doctors more time to examine lungs, the XPS system could mean fewer donor organs are wasted, and more patients get the call to receive a transplant. Evans-Smith was only on the waiting list for nine days. The Royal Papworth team that performed the first surgery with the XPS system in the UK used a technique called ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). EVLP is a technique used widely in Europe and the US but has not been common practice in the UK. There have been a small number of EVLP transplants in the UK before, largely limited to clinical trials or relied on different machines. Since their success with Evans-Smith, surgeons have performed transplants on three more patients using the XPS system. The machine mimics the environment of the human body, allowing the lungs to inflate and deflate as normal. A special fluid maintains them and helps to restore normal function, allowing them to be maintained and even improved. The lungs can be preserved in this way for up to six hours. If they perform well over at least three hours of testing, they are removed from the system ready for transplantation. Evans-Smith was operated on by a multidisciplinary team led by the consultant surgeons Marius Berman, Giuseppe Aresu and Pradeep Kaul. After rehab in critical care and then on the surgical ward, he returned home to Northampton recently to continue his recovery. Berman, the surgical lead for transplantation at Royal Papworth, said: “We are very proud to have become the first UK hospital to use this machine for a clinical ex-vivo lung perfusion case, which has helped to provide Daniel with suitable donor lungs. Without this innovation, he may still have been waiting for a transplant today.” The chair of a national NHS lungs advisory group, Jasvir Parmar, said the machine marks a significant shift in doctors’ ability to evaluate and boost the quality of donated lungs. “Once you have the lungs out of the body, you are then able to improve their performance, so it provides not just an assessment tool but also a therapeutic tool.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s national medical director for organ and tissue donation and transplantation, Prof Derek Manas, said the machine could help reduce the organ donor waiting list. “With more than 200 people currently waiting for a lung transplant, this significantly outweighs the number of suitable donor organs. It is vital that we support innovation to improve the chances that these desperately ill patients will get the call they are waiting for. “We are grateful for the work to improve transplantation technology and techniques but most of all grateful to the patients and families who agree to save and improve lives through organ donation.” Evans-Smith is now looking forward to continuing to recover his health over Christmas without the burden of COPD. “Prior to this, I struggled to walk up a hill or to walk any form of distance without having to consider where I be able to stop and rest to catch my breath. “Now I might be doing 7,000 steps a day, including going up and down hills, and I can do 3,000 steps without even stopping for a breath. It’s just amazing, isn’t it?”"

          "bodyText": "I adore potted shrimp. Not only do these little ramekins, with their jolly red sprinkle of cayenne pepper atop a golden cap of clarified butter, feel like fishy emissaries from a more elegant age, but they can also be prepared days in advance, which frees me up to drink fizz with friends instead of faffing around in the kitchen. A Christmas gift indeed. Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 200g unsalted butter Juice of ¼ lemon ¼ tsp ground mace ¼ tsp ground white pepper ½ tsp anchovy paste/Gentleman’s Relish 200g cooked and peeled brown shrimps Cayenne pepper, to serve (optional) Fresh dill, to serve (optional) 4 slices thin white bread, to serve (optional) 1 Shrimp or small prawns? Cooked and peeled brown shrimp (whiskery beasts about 5cm long) are available in many supermarkets, fishmongers and online, but small peeled prawns will also work fine here, too. If you’re eating this dish within a couple of days, there’s no real need to clarify the butter (though it does give the end result a pleasingly silky texture), so you can skip steps 3 to 5, if you prefer. 2 The other ingredients I’ve stuck to traditional flavourings here: anchovy paste can be easily tracked down in larger supermarkets, delis and online, but if need be, you could substitute some finely mashed anchovies in oil, or indeed leave them out altogether and salt more generously. Nutmeg is a good replacement for mace, and black pepper for white. See step 9 for other suggestions. 3 Melt the butter Put the butter (unsalted is best here, because clarifying will concentrate the flavour, but it’s not the end of the world if you have only salted) in a small pan, preferably one that’s white or silver in colour, because that makes it easier to see what’s going on inside, and melt over a gentle heat. 4 Ready your tools While keeping an eye on the butter pan, put a clean piece of cheesecloth, a thin cotton or linen tea towel, a thick or doubled-up sheet of kitchen towel or a fine sieve over a heatproof jug. The butter will come to a simmer and then begin to foam vigorously. 5 Strain the butter Once the foam dies down, the liquid butter underneath will begin to bubble as the water boils off. When it slows and almost stops, this means most of the water has evaporated. Keep a very careful eye on the pan – once the solids in the bottom begin to colour and brown, strain the butter through the cloth into the jug. 6 Add the flavourings Wipe out the pan and return two-thirds of the butter to it. Stir in the lemon juice, mace, pepper and anchovy paste, and simmer very gently for five minutes. Add a pinch of salt, take off the heat and leave to cool to warm or room temperature, but not so much that it starts to set. 7 Pour over the shrimp Divide the shrimp between four ramekins, pressing them in tightly, then top with the spiced butter and put in a cool place to cool fully and set. Once solid, pour over the remainder of the clarified butter and chill in the fridge until set. Bring to room temperature, then sprinkle with cayenne pepper and/or fresh dill before serving with hot toast (melba for preference). I like watercress on the side, too. 8 To make melba toast … Lightly toast thin, crustless slices of bread under a grill or in a toaster, then cut in half sideways/horizontally through the soft middle to create even thinner slices. Cut these into triangles and toast again until golden on both sides. If you’re making the melba toast in advance, leave to cool completely, then store in an airtight container. Reheat briefly in a medium oven before serving. 9 Variations on the theme Play around with the flavourings. Try adding lemon zest, black pepper and chopped dill, say, or smoked paprika or chilli flakes and crushed garlic, or mustard powder, Tabasco and chives. Stir in any fresh herbs once the butter has cooled, though. As long as the clarified butter covers the shrimp completely, these should keep for a good week in the fridge."

          "bodyText": "Boohoo shareholders have blocked Mike Ashley and an associate from joining its board in a blow to the Sports Direct founder’s attempt to control the struggling online fashion retailer. Investors representing 64% of Bohoo’s stock voted against appointing Ashley and Mike Lennon at a special meeting on Friday morning called by Ashley’s Frasers Group. The chair of Boohoo, Tim Morris, said shareholders had given “a resounding vote of confidence in our board” at the meeting. He said 99% of those that voted – excluding the 27% stake in Boohoo controlled by Ashley’s Frasers Group – had chosen to block Ashley’s appointment. Morris said Boohoo would now “like to get on with running our business”, although it is not clear how Frasers will respond to the vote. Boohoo became a target after its value plunged from its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic to a low when the online shopping bubble burst as spending moved back to the high street. Further potential conflict lies ahead. Frasers has already called a second meeting – for 21 January – to ask shareholders to oust the Boohoo founder and vice-chair, Mahmud Kamani. Ashley had sought to become the chief executive of Boohoo but was blocked by the company from putting that proposal to shareholders. He then offered to “work collaboratively” with the new Boohoo boss, Dan Finley, if he won a board post. However, he has criticised Kamani for being an “egotistical founder who has an unhealthy grip on the board”. He also said Boohoo was “in desperate need of the guidance I can provide”. Finley, who was promoted from his role as head of Boohoo’s Debenhams online department store after driving growth there, said he was “really excited about the opportunities ahead”. Boohoo has said Frasers could put forward an alternative to Ashley to represent its interests. However, Morris said any candidate would have to meet certain conditions to ensure there was not a conflict of interest given Frasers’ position as a competitor. Ashley has made Boohoo the latest in a long line of targets for his corporate empire which includes brands ranging from House of Fraser and Flannels to Evans Cycles and Game UK. Morris has said Ashley and Lennon were “not appropriate candidates to join the board in any circumstances” because of “obvious conflict points”."

          "headline": "What is the US debt ceiling?",
          "bodyText": "Donald Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan to prevent a government shutdown before the Friday deadline and called for the outright elimination of the debt ceiling. The US is one of the few countries with a statutory limit on how much debt the federal government can accumulate. Here’s what to know about the US debt ceiling. What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling is the limit on the amount of money the US government can borrow to pay for services, such as social security, Medicare and the military. Each year, the government takes in revenue from taxes and other streams, such as customs duties, but ultimately spends more than it takes in. This leaves the government with a deficit, which has ranged from $400bn to $3tn each year over the last decade. The deficit left at the end of the year ultimately gets tacked on to the country’s total debt. To borrow money, the US treasury issues securities, like US government bonds, that it will eventually pay back with interest. Once the US government hits its debt limit, the treasury cannot issue more securities, essentially stopping a key flow of money into the federal government. Congress is in charge of setting the debt limit, which currently stands at $31.4tn. The debt ceiling has been raised 78 times since 1960, under both Democrat and Republican presidents. At times, the ceiling was briefly suspended and then reinstated at a higher limit, essentially a retroactive raising of the debt ceiling. What happens if the US defaults? The US has never defaulted on its payments before, so exactly what would happen is unclear. It’s not likely to be good. “Failure to meet the government’s obligation would cause irreparable harm to the US economy, the livelihoods of all Americans and global financial stability,” the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in a letter to Congress in January 2023. Investors would lose faith in the US dollar, causing the economy to weaken quickly. Job cuts would be imminent, and the US federal government would not have the means to continue all its services. Mortgage rates would probably soar – tanking the housing market. Why is the US debt so high? The US debt grows when the government is spending more money or when its revenue is lower. Throughout its history, the US has had at least some amount of debt. But the debt really started to grow in the 80s, after Ronald Reagan’s huge tax cuts. Without as much tax revenue, the government needed to borrow more money to spend. During the 90s, the end of the cold war allowed the government to cut back on defense spending, and a booming economy led to higher tax revenues. But then, in the early 2000s, the dotcom bubble burst, leading to a recession. George W Bush cut taxes twice, in 2001 and 2003, and then the US military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan increased spending by as much as nearly $6tn over the course of the war. When the 2008 Great Recession started, the government had to bulk up spending to bail out banks and increase social services as the unemployment rate hit 10%. When the unemployment rate returned to its pre-recession levels, in 2017, a major tax cut was passed under Trump. The debt rose by $7.8tn while he was in office. And then the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The US government passed a series of stimulus bills to offset the worst of the pandemic’s impacts that ultimately totaled $5tn. What are the main contributors to federal government spending? The biggest chunk of US government spending goes to mandatory programs, such as social security, Medicaid and Medicare, which comprise nearly half of the overall annual budget. Military spending takes up the biggest chunk of discretionary spending, taking up 12% of the budget. Other big-ticket items include spending on education, employment training and services and benefits for US veterans."

          "headline": "Beyond 2034: can the Saudi Arabia soccer dream truly be sustainable?",
          "bodyText": "Last week’s confirmation that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup was met with a strangely muted reaction throughout the footballing world – and at the Fifa Congress itself, which took the form of an extended Zoom call. Mostly this was because the announcement itself was a foregone conclusion; with no other countries bidding to host the 2034 tournament, and the vote in favor of the 2030 hosts effectively dependent on simultaneous approval of the Saudis’ 2034 bid, there was little of the fanfare that usually accompanies Fifa’s biggest proclamations, and none of the shock that accompanied the revelation of past World Cup bid winners like Qatar. The debate about the Saudis’ suitability as a World Cup host was lost well before last week’s Fifa Congress; the country’s appalling human rights record and odious history of internal oppression are no secret to Fifa, but football’s peak body brushed all that aside and went ahead with last week’s formalities regardless. If the spectacle of Fifa member states raising their hands to applaud over Zoom in support of the Saudis’ 2034 bid felt like a strange way to seal the petro-monarchy’s footballing coronation, however, it’s perhaps because a vague sense has started to come into focus that all is not well with the Saudi sporting project. This is not to suggest that the Saudis will not succeed in holding the 2034 World Cup; the tournament is the showpiece event in crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s long-term initiative to wean the Saudi economy off oil and turn his country into a hub of the global leisure economy, so no expense will be spared in ensuring it is a success. But the world looks very different today to 2016, when bin Salman’s Vision 2030 blueprint for the Saudi economy was first released, or even early 2023, when the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, took over four teams in the Saudi Pro League and tossed off almost $1bn in transfer fees to lure the world’s top footballing talent to the Arabian peninsula. Viewership of Saudi football in the major western TV markets is appallingly low; the spigots of cash that foamed the runway for Ronaldo and the rest to head east appear to have dried up; the median team in the Saudi Pro League remains a strange jalopy of veteran Champions League talent bolted onto a weak spine of local recruits; and the league itself has made virtually no impression on the global footballing consciousness, except as a money pit. Football fans outside Saudi Arabia have, perhaps unsurprisingly, failed to thrill to the prospect of weekend clashes between Al Hilal and Damac FC, and there are signs that fans inside Saudi Arabia are beginning to feel equally lukewarm: the league’s average attendance this season is just 7,880, which makes the Saudi league roughly as popular as Peru’s Primera Division. Money, potentially, could help cure some of these ills, but money seems in increasingly short supply: recent reports indicate that the Saudi government has now de-prioritized work on the NEOM giga-project amid construction delays and rising costs, and the general direction of travel in Saudi public finances is toward retrenchment rather than expansion. As Riyadh shelves plans for the exotic mega-cubes and vast linear cities that were set to be at the heart of NEOM, there’s now a real question of how sustainable the Saudi dream of turning its own football league into a competition to rival Europe’s best really is. The macroeconomic environment that favored a raid on European football in 2022 is no longer so helpful: oil prices have dropped considerably and remain well below the level the IMF says the Saudis need them at to balance the national budget; oil supply from countries like the US, Brazil and Canada is on the rise, which increases the likelihood of sustained softness in the price of crude; and consumer demand from China, the key market for hydrocarbon economies like Saudi Arabia’s, looks set to plateau in the coming years. Saudi public finances remain relatively healthy – public debt, for instance, is well below the levels commonly seen throughout the developed world – but the era of spending without consequence, spending for fun, seems definitively over. Meanwhile the developed world, and the US in particular, has exited the cycle of persistently low interest rates that characterized the period following the financial crisis; despite the Saudis’ recent move to streamline foreign investment laws, this means that the easy structural logic that smoothed the passage of institutional money from the low-interest-rate West into fast-growing, high-yield “emerging economies” like Saudi Arabia no longer holds. All of which suggests that there are real economic clouds gathering on the horizon as the Saudi state attempts to sustain the spending needed to realize its sporting ambitions. Geopolitical distractions have multiplied for the Saudis at the exact moment that the global economic backdrop has begun to sour. Riyad Mahrez, Neymar, Ruben Neves and the rest touched down in Saudi Arabia at what appeared to be a moment of growing stabilization across the Middle East: Neymar arrived in Riyadh just a few weeks before Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that Israel was on the verge of a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia. Now the Saudis face a region ablaze, and the fall of Bashar al-Assad has created a real contest for influence in Syria, long considered a client state of Russia and Iran, in which the Saudis will wish to be decisive. This will place further strain on already-stretched public resources. There’s a mild historical irony here in that the whole impetus for Vision 2030 was to escape the vagaries of the oil price cycle. But oil rents are still the Saudis’ main source of revenue; escaping the resource trap still depends, under bin Salman’s plan at least, on the money that energy sales bring in. Structurally, diversifying away from energy makes sense as long as the revenue streams that energy reserves guarantee remain in place. But the comparatively docile and predictable world that triggered the Saudis’ “footballing turn” – a world of high oil prices, bottomless Chinese consumer demand, frisky western capital, and geopolitical stasis throughout the Middle East – simply does not exist anymore. To be fair, the Saudi state still has a good amount of fiscal room to continue spending to fund its various national development projects. But Riyadh’s increasing recourse to debt – issuing bonds to global investors – suggests that it is beginning to feel the financial strain of juggling multiple priorities simultaneously. Recent footballing history is littered with cautionary tales of unsustainable league growth, and the story they tell will be worryingly familiar for the Saudis. The J League expanded aggressively in the mid-1990s, attracting foreign stars like Gary Lineker, Paulo Futre and Basile Boli, but several clubs quickly ran into financial difficulties amid the bursting of the Japanese real estate bubble; eventually a number of franchises folded and the league was restructured in the late 1990s on a more modest foundation. Chinese president Xi Jinping approved a “football reform plan” in 2015 under which the government’s stated goal was to qualify for, host, and eventually win a World Cup. This ambitious plan effectively gave the green light for breakneck development of the Chinese Super League, and it wasn’t long before astronomical transfer fees and eye-watering salaries lured some of the biggest names in the world game – Hulk, Carlos Tevez, Oscar – east. “China looks to have the financial power to move a whole European league to China,” Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger fretted at the time. But the bubble burst almost as quickly as it inflated: a new mood of austerity took hold across China as Xi moved to curb irrational spending and excess among top Communist party cadres, and eventually this found a form of local expression across the Super League in a new “luxury tax” that effectively terminated the era of big-money transfers to China. Meanwhile the slow implosion of the Chinese real estate sector took several of the league’s splashiest clubs – many of whose owners, such as the troubled Evergrande Group, had significant exposure to the domestic property market – down with it: the death of the Chinese Super League project was meaningfully linked to the market correction that came from over-zealous domestic development, especially in construction. The final blow came with the pandemic, which led to a general slump in broadcasting and sponsorship revenues. The Chinese Super League today is a far more humble project than it was in the go-go years of weekly £200,000 salaries for Graziano Pelle and Marouane Fellaini, and China has now effectively abandoned its dreams of global footballing supremacy; the national “football reform plan” will not be troubling the text of a Xi Jinping oration any time soon. In both Japan and China, economic conditions intervened to kill the dream of national footballing supremacy. In both places, a nationwide construction boom (hello, NEOM) mirrored and in some senses fostered an unsustainable expansion of the domestic soccer league. That may, however, be as far as the analogy can take us here. Modern Saudi Arabia is not Japan in the 1990s or pre-Covid China. In those countries, the failures of various sporting-developmental projects could be absorbed at no great political or cultural cost; both the Japanese and Chinese economies were far bigger and more meaningfully diversified at the point of their league implosions than Saudi Arabia’s is today. The Saudi Pro League could very well be too big and important to bin Salman’s plans for his country to fail. But how long can the poorly attended party last?"

          "headline": "‘It’s undemocratic’: Waspi women on the decision not to pay compensation",
          "bodyText": "Hilary Simpson is fed up with being asked how she feels about the government’s failure to tell her that the pension age had changed and its refusal to compensate her. “It’s abundantly clear how we’re all feeling,” she said “Campaigners have given endless interviews, spelling out the devastating effects of the initial injustice – and now the government has said it won’t compensate us, we’re moved beyond feelings: this is now a serious, constitutional issue.” Simpson took early retirement in 2009, when she was 55, from her job in local government. She wanted to help her daughter get on in her career by taking on childcare responsibilities. “Because I had no evidence to the contrary, I assumed I’d be getting my pension at 60,” she said. “I draw up a spreadsheet for how to make my lump sum last five years, then signed on the dotted line.” It was only after she retired that she discovered she had been affected by legislation, passed in 1995, that meant she would not get her state pension until she was 63. “There was no excuse for either my employers or the DWP not having told me,” she said. “I worked next door to the HR department. I’d never moved house – the government had all my details.” With no other choice, Simpson adapted her spreadsheet to make the lump sum last eight years instead of five. But then, in 2011, the pension changes were accelerated: suddenly, a lump sum that looked perfectly reasonable for five years now had to stretch over 10-and-a-half years. “But we’ve had enough of sob stories. Let’s look at now,” she said. “For a start, where has the government got the figure that 90% of women knew about the changes? The DWP have said they don’t know how many letters they sent out or to whom. That certainly doesn’t chime with any research we’re aware of, not to mention people’s personal testimonies, of which Waspi has many thousands.” For another thing, said Simpson, the government could not just ignore the ombudsman’s decision that all those affected were eligible for up to almost £3,000 compensation each. “This is an important, fundamental point,” she said. “Ombudsmans’ decisions are final and there is no appeal. To reject their rulings is a serious constitutional issue with far-ranging political implications.” Judith Robertson agreed. “I’m deeply shocked and disappointed but more than that, it’s the undemocratic nature of the decision that has outraged me most,” she said. The decision has led Robertson to question her lifelong membership of the Labour party. “Abiding by the ombudsman’s decision is the check and balance of a democratic society. Ignoring it is the start of a slippery slope,” she said. “The democratic process required this to be subject to debate in the house and an open vote,” added the former deputy headteacher. “The values being demonstrated today are not those of a caring party. It does make me question what Labour stands for now.” Elizabeth Stanley, a Labour party councillor, is also critical. “I remain committed to the party but this isn’t right,” she said. “The argument that it’s a wrong use of taxpayers’ money is bizarre: all us Waspi women are taxpayers. It’s like we’re invisible.” But other women born in the 1950s say the decision is the correct one. Anne had to wait an extra year for her pension. “But I knew this was going to happen because all the information was on the government’s website,” she said. “Coming up to retirement and pension age, I made it my job to keep myself informed about state pension rules. “I agree with the government,” she said “I would rather £10bn was spent on children, especially those in poverty.” Gill, 69, agreed. “Paying everyone out of limited funds is not proportionate,” she said. But women born in the 1950s who have also lost out with cuts to the winter fuel allowance feel yesterday’s announcement particularly keenly. Christine not only had to work an extra two years before she could claim her state pension and is on the old-style pension payments, so gets £40 a week less than the newer £200 payment. “I lost my winter fuel allowance and my income has almost halved since my husband died earlier this year,” she said. “The government seem to be in some sort of strange bubble: are we the ‘broadest shoulders’ which they said would pay their fair share? “I will find it difficult to vote for Labour again – and I have voted Labour all my life. Frankly, I’m very, very disappointed in them,” she said. Jacqueline criticised Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, Angela Rayner and Liz Kendall, all of whom backed the women’s campaign in opposition. “Blaming the previous government for this about-turn is disingenuous,” she said. “Yes, there’s a black hole in government finances but there are now huge numbers of vulnerable people whose lives will be much worse in this first winter of a Labour government than before it. That’s not the kind, caring party we voted for.”"

          "headline": "Mike Tomlin has never had a losing NFL season. Trust is key to his success",
          "bodyText": "Earlier this month, Mike Tomlin was asked what he had learned about his receivers in the absence of the group’s star, George Pickens, through injury. It was not the first time Tomlin’s team had been questioned this season, and it will probably not be the last. As ever though, the Pittsburgh Steelers head coach expressed his faith in his players. “We believe in our group. I have said that repeatedly and maybe you will start believing me,” he replied. “We have a bunch of guys who want to be the reason we are successful,” the 52-year-old continued. The message pointed to trust as an essential pillar of his coaching style, as Tomlin could just as easily have been speaking in preseason when quizzed about the dangers of a supposed has-been and a never-was – Russell Wilson and Justin Fields respectively – fighting for the right to be the Steelers’ starting quarterback. The uplifting power of Tomlin’s trust remains the same, whether for a backup wideout or for Fields in a crucial fourth and short. If you join the Steelers you become better. It is that simple truth that has helped earn another visit to the postseason while extending Tomlin’s historic run of never having a losing season in almost 20 years as Steelers head coach. Pittsburgh are back in the playoffs, after Miami and Indianapolis quietly exited the race on Sunday, despite doubts over Wilson and Fields, despite a lack of stars in offensive skill positions and despite a fierce schedule. With his immense body of work, Tomlin’s plan at quarterback should have been trusted from the outset, even when the loser of the preseason tussle, Fields, started Week 1 in place of the injured Wilson. After all, trust in Tomlin usually pays off. Keith Butler, the Steelers’ defensive coordinator from 2015-22, explains as much as he details his career-changing experience working with a fresh-faced 24-year-old graduate assistant, 16 years his junior. “My history with Mike goes back well before the Steelers,” Butler says, jumping at the chance to share his history with his great friend. “When I got out of playing with the Seahawks I didn’t want to move my family around all over the country to coach. So my thoughts were to try and spend my career at the University of Memphis. There were guys that are just getting out of college who help the coaching staff, as they’re trying to get in the business, as graduate assistants. Mike did that with us and even as a [graduate assistant] I thought he did a good job of learning from the staff. He was willing to learn.” Even in his first steps in coaching, Tomlin marked himself out as a leader. The pair would then reunite, with Butler coaching linebackers, when Pittsburgh picked Tomlin to take over as head coach in 2007. In his sophomore season their journey would reach an unmatchable high by winning Super Bowl XLIII. Heath Miller, who collected his second ring with the Steelers in that game, expands on how Tomlin keeps hold of hearts and minds in the locker room. “Coach Tomlin has the appropriate amount of confidence,” the former tight end says, “and that trickles down to everybody on the roster. When you know the coach has confidence and belief in you that goes a really long way. “He is open and honest about what he expects from his players. He’s always able to find ways to motivate individuals. And it’s different every year. It’s different on an individual basis. He’s a really good people person, so he can get to know guys and know what buttons might work on this guy and those he needs to push with another guy to keep them motivated, to keep them hungry, to keep them on edge. That’s not easy to do.” It has certainly been different this year in Pittsburgh. Several seasons of soul searching in the post-Ben Roethlisberger era led Tomlin to return to his defensive roots. With a placeholder in Kenny Pickett at quarterback, he turned to TJ Watt and a methodically rebuilt defensive power to scrape by. The offense was all but mothballed and since then Tomlin’s typically explosive Steelers have swerved back to the more conservative ideology that clinched the Super Bowl for Bill Cowher in the 2005 season and Tomlin three years later. Pittsburgh just needed a capable quarterback to put the offense in a position to win games rather than tread water. Cynicism was understandable, considering Tomlin had not played quarterback whisperer in his first 15 seasons. Then along came Pickett. It is a minor miracle that the now Eagles backup threw 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions with a dismal QB rating of 78.7 while also producing six fourth-quarter comeback wins while recording a 14-10 record in Pittsburgh. These strange figures speak of Pickett holding incredible self-belief despite a clearly limited ability to throw the ball. The man who helped instil that belief and squeeze out every drop of Pickett’s talent was surely Tomlin. The idea he could do the same for Wilson, a faded Super Bowl winning quarterback who still has bucketloads of throwing power, becomes less strange when viewed through the lens of Pickett’s often technically grim play that also, occasionally, reached unlikely glory. You could say Tomlin has restored an appropriate amount of Wilson’s confidence. That’s essential grounding for the Steelers as they bid to not just make up the numbers in January, where they have failed so often recently – their last postseason victory came in 2017 against the Chiefs, when Alex Smith was still the Kansas City quarterback, and Pittsburgh have lost five straight postseason games since then. Tomlin’s soft defense-first reset and the return of Pickens to correct recent struggles in scoring will be crucial as they bid to clinch the AFC North title on Saturday. A win over Baltimore would let that confidence bubble up a little further with, as Miller puts it, the team “battle-tested and ready” for the postseason."

          "bodyText": "Lauren Bell took four wickets as England fought back on day two of their one-off Test match against South Africa and extended their lead to 145 runs in Bloemfontein. Despite their solid start, a batting collapse saw the Proteas dismissed for 281 in response to the visitors’ opening-day 395 for nine declared. Captain Laura Wolvaardt put on a 92-run partnership with Annerie Dercksen, making 65 before being dismissed by Sophie Ecclestone. Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp proved a difficult duo to break as the pair added 99 in the afternoon, but debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay found the breakthrough by bowling Kapp for her first Test wicket, then dismissed Nadine de Klerk for a duck after lightning caused a break in play. Bell completed South Africa’s demise with three quick wickets, including two in two balls. The hosts claimed a valuable wicket by dismissing Maia Bouchier for a duck, but Tammy Beaumont and Heather Knight steered England to 31 for one at stumps. PA Media Lauren Bell, who took four wickets, has had a chat with TMS. “It’s been a great day, we’d have taken that at the start, they had patches of good partnerships, we’re really happy. My job is to swing it and take new-ball wickets and Filer’s is to bowl fast. The pitch is giving us movement and the ball is wobbling. England will be heading Down Under in January for the Women’s Ashes. “We’re playing in a country with similar conditions to Australia, so it’s really important,” Bell adds. “We’ve said at the start of the game how amazing a result is in Test cricket. Things can change very quickly but we’ll take it an hour at a time.” Why not sign up for The Spin, our weekly cricket newsletter sent bouncing into your inbox every week? The South Africa captain, Laura Wolvaardt, has a quick word with the umpires – perhaps about that rain-free weather delay earlier, which threw off the hosts’ batting rhythm. Still, there was lightning. So ends a day where England began on top, saw South Africa work their way towards parity, and then regained the momentum as the hosts’ tail failed entirely to wag. They lead by 145 runs, with plenty of time to build a lead and then get the wickets required to win. 14th over: England 31-1 (Knight 19, Beaumont 8) Knight takes a single to rotate the strike, leaving Beaumont to see out the rest of Sekhukhune’s over – the last of the day. There’s a nervy moment as the ball gets lost under her feet, before the final ball is crunched away, but well-fielded for a single. And that’s stumps. 13th over: England 29-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 7) Beaumont is bamboozled by Mlaba, trying to sweep, missing and getting a lucky break as the ball squirms through the wicketkeeper’s legs. Four leg byes, followed up with a much cleaner sweep shot off her 30th ball faced that more than doubles her run tally. 12th over: England 21-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 3) Sekhukune will get a chance before stumps – the fifth bowler to feature in the first 12 overs. She has Knight on the defensive with a series of accurate, testing deliveries in a maiden. 11th over: England 21-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 3) Knight now faces the tricky Mlaba and gets beaten by a near-unplayable ball that just misses the edge. The next ball sits up, and Knight drives for a single. England’s lead creeps up to 135. 10th over: England 19-1 (Knight 17, Beaumont 3) Heather Knight is settling any English nerves here, striking another two well-timed boundaries off Dercksen, who is yet to find her rhythm. 9th over: England 11-1 (Knight 8, Beaumont 3) South Africa change it up with Mlaba’s spin as the shadows start to lengthen. She is egged on heartily by her teammates, and watched carefully by Beaumont. Another maiden. 8th over: England 11-1 (Knight 8, Beaumont 3) Annerie Dercksen comes in to the attack, but a poor first ball is flicked away by Heather Knight for four. Another short, wide effort is crashed through the covers by the England captain, who gets the scoreboard moving. 7th over: England 3-1 (Beamount 3, Knight 0) Beaumont goes on the hunt for a boundary, slicing at Kapp’s first ball but its fielded smartly by Dercksen at backward point. 6th over: England 3-1 (Beamount 3, Knight 0) Heather Knight comes in, England opting against night watch for now. Test debutant Bouchier scored 126 in the first innings, and zero in the second. Hlubi continues to look dangerous, a low grubber that Knight does well to leave alone. Maia Bouchier has faced 18 balls without scoring … and now she’s out for a 19-ball duck! It’s a brilliant ball from Hlubi that jags in towards the off-stump and finds the outside edge. What a boost for the hosts! 5th over: England 3-0 (Beamount 3, Bouchier 0) We can play until 6.15pm local time (4.15pm GMT), as long as the light holds. Beaumount runs for two after flicking Kapp into the on-side. A chance to drive through covers off the final ball, but she can’t find the gap. 4th over: England 1-0 (Beamount 1, Bouchier 0) After 18 straight dot-balls, Beaumont nudges one into the covers. Hlubi appeals for lbw as a delivery skids into the pads, but it looked a touch wide. Then, a bouncer digs into the turf and whistles over Bouchier’s head, bouncing again before it reaches Jafta behind the stumps. 3rd over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Kapp to Maia Bouchier for a second maiden, and third in a row. There are 12 allotted overs left in the day, and presumably at some point, England will score a run. 2nd over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Ayanda Hlubi to Tammy Beaumont for an uneventful maiden over. TV coverage is saying play will end in 15 minutes, but it’s possible an extra half-hour could be taken if the allotted overs aren’t played out. 1st over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Marizanne Kapp, who had a long afternoon at the crease, will bowl the first over. She finds movement straight away to test Bouchier in a maiden. Not quite sure at this stage how much time England have to see out here – play is being extended due to the storm delay, but bad light may be a factor. From 237-3, the hosts fell away either side of the storm delay, adding just 44 more runs. England will return to bat out the day with a ton-plus first-innings lead. Lauren Bell ends with figures of 4-49, while MacDonald-Gay took two key wickets on her Test debut. Sciver-Brunt is hooked away by Sekhukhune for a single, which puts Hlubi on strike. The next ball swings away and as Hlubi shuffles to her left, she’s caught lbw to end South Africa’s innings. 88th over: South Africa 280-9 (Sekhukhune 6, Hlubi 1) No hatty for Bell as an attempted yorker goes wide of leg. The last woman in, Ayanda Hlubi, is beaten by a swinging final ball, but South Africa cling on. Nonkululeko Mlaba is out at No 9; 90 minutes ago, the chances of her having to bat today looked remote. It’s a very brief cameo, though: a swing and a miss, Bell uproots her middle stump, and the bowler is on a hat-trick … Lauren Bell gets her third wicket, the ball cutting back in and finding a big old gap, clacking into the off-stump as Jafta fails to sort her feet out. The variety dished up by England’s bowlers got her in a muddle, and South Africa’s collapse continues. Time for drinks. 88th over: South Africa 278-7 (Jafta 8, Sekhukhune 5) From 113-1 and 237-3, falling short of 300 would be a big disappointment for the hosts. Jafta is surviving, not thriving, having hardly settled … 87th over: South Africa 278-7 (Jafta 8, Sekhukhune 5) Filer steps back after another three-over burst, replaced by Nat Sciver-Brunt. We have another delay to cover up a glitching LED screen. Jafta is beaten on the outside by a floating ball that misses the edge. 86th over: South Africa 275-7 (Jafta 7, Sekhukhune 4) Tumi Sekhukhune walks out to face Lauren Bell, her side teetering on the brink … and the lefty smashes her first ball through the covers for four! Shot. They’ll need a few more of those from the tail-enders. Chloe Tryon shakes her head after a sorry looking shot, badly mistimed and wafted to Tammy Beaumont at mid-on. A promising start snuffed out, and England are well on top now. 86th over: South Africa 271-6 (Tryon 20, Jafta 7) The inky black clouds are receding, and it’s looking sunny and serene in Bloemfontein. Tryon attempts to drive Lauren Bell back down the ground, but sends the ball crashing into the stumps at the non-striker’s end … 85th over: South Africa 271-6 (Tryon 20, Jafta 7) Sinalo Jafta gets in on the act, dispatching a full Filer delivery through square leg for four. There’s another pause as Jafta asks for the white curtain to be pulled back over an LED screen. Another bouncing ball smacks Tryon on her right glove; she’s suffering for her craft out there. 84th over: South Africa 265-6 (Tryon 19, Jafta 2) Because of the break in play earlier, they’ll take an extra half-hour and play on until 5.30pm local (3.30pm GMT). A tough spell for South Africa, trying to hold steady but keep adding runs when they can. After a Bell delivery just misses her outside edge, Tryon picks her moment with a fierce cover drive. 83rd over: South Africa 261-6 (Tryon 15, Jafta 2) Sinalo Jafta comes to the crease, and tries to duck beneath a bouncer that clips her on the helmet. She is checked over by the medics before carrying on. A big appeal as Filer gets more movement and strikes Jafta’s thigh pad, but the umpire declines. Filer strikes with the new ball, which moves away and catches the very bottom corner of Luus’ bat, sailing through to Jones. Another big wicket, the batter’s gritty 56 off 148 finally brought to an end. 82nd over: South Africa 259-5 (Luus 56, Tryon 15) Lauren Bell replaces RMG as England seek to bully their way into South Africa’s tail. The hosts will be aiming to reach 300 – and get within 100 runs of England’s total – without taking on too much damage. Just one that over, taken by Luus off the final ball. 81st over: South Africa 258-5 (Luus 55, Tryon 15) Filer is handed the new ball, and her first delivery rears up onto Tryon’s wrists. The batter responds by lifting a wider ball square through the off-side. 80th over: South Africa 252-5 (Luus 54, Tryon 10) MacDonald-Gay continues as sunlight falls on the pitch again – but with the skies over the city a troubling slate-grey colour. A couple of quick singles are the only change South Africa get out of that over, and the new ball is now available to their opponents. 79th over: South Africa 250-5 (Luus 53, Tryon 9) Ecclestone’s economy is a skinny 1.65 runs per over – she’s giving very little away, and delivers another maiden here, her ninth of the match. 78th over: South Africa 250-5 (Luus 53, Tryon 9) England were past 350 by this point before a flurry of late wickets; South Africa may need to start moving the scoreboard. Chloe Tryon understands the assignment, showing off her white-ball skills with two straight drives to the rope, and another salvaged at midwicket. 77th over: South Africa 238-5 (Luus 50, Tryon 0) Ecclestone – who has now bowled 10 more overs than any of her teammates – tests Tryon’s nerves with a tricky maiden over. The new ball is available in three overs’ time, and it feels like the pendulum has edged back in England’s favour. 76th over: South Africa 238-5 (Luus 50, Tryon 0) Chloe Tryon comes to the crease and after a leg-bye, Luus holds firm for the rest of the over. Lightning didn’t strike twice, but Ryana MacDonald-Gay has. Ryana MacDonald-Gay took a big wicket just before the break … and she gets another with her second ball. It’s a belting delivery that catches De Klerk’s edge and is snaffled by Amy Jones behind the stumps. 75th over: South Africa 237-4 (Luus 50, De Klerk 0) So, we’re back – and Luus sees off the final ball of Ecclestone’s over, halted earlier by a crack of thunder. Things looking brighter out there now, for what could be a pivotal spell in this four-day Test. The covers went on but the rain never actually arrived – and with half an hour having passed with no more lightning, we’re going to restart play at 4.05pm local, 2.05pm GMT. While we wait, here’s Simon Burnton with his guide to the year’s most outrageous sporting behaviour … Both teams have headed back to the pavilion, Luus having taken her pads off. The covers are on now with rain arriving; with around 90 minutes left before close of play, it’s touch and go whether we’ll get any more action. 75th over: South Africa 237-4 (Luus 50, De Klerk 0) Nadine de Klerk is next to the crease, with the Luus-Kapp partnership ending agonisingly on 99. Ecclestone has the ball … but a thunder clap stops her in her tracks! “That was scary,” she mutters, and the umpires agree, calling the players off with one ball left in the over. Just as frustration was beginning to build for England, Ryana MacDonald-Gay pounces with her first Test wicket, changing the angle with her final ball to get through Kapp’s defences when she least expected it. 74th over: South Africa 237-3 (Kapp 57, Luus 50) Half-century for Sune Luus! Luus gets past the 50 mark, at a much gentler pace of 124 balls. It’s a third Test 50 in a row for her. Kapp follows it up as she cuts away a wider MacDonald-Gay delivery through that big gap in the off-side … 73rd over: South Africa 231-3 (Kapp 52, Luus 49) Kapp can’t find her way through the covers, a single setting up Sune Luus to try and claim her half-century. Ecclestone doesn’t give her a chance, though. 72nd over: South Africa 230-3 (Kapp 51, Luus 49) There’s a big gap in England’s field beyond the off-stump which will tempt both batters. Luus finds the gap, a fielder scrambling over from backward point as they run for a couple. This partnership is now at 92, level with Wolvaardt and Dercksen’s total from earlier in the innings. 71st over: South Africa 227-3 (Kapp 50, Luus 47) Kapp gets her fifty! Ecclestone is finding turn and bounce but Kapp times her moment to clip one away past short leg, and bring up her half-century, briskly put together off 64 balls. 70th over: South Africa 226-3 (Kapp 49, Luus 47) Test debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay is handed the cherry, as lightning flashes in the distance. The last of the over gets beyond Luus’ defences, inside-edged into her midriff. The umpires again look up to the skies. We’re back out for the evening session, with the floodlights on and the rain staying away, for now. Time for tea, which might dovetail nicely with this impending rain shower. That is South Africa’s session, with 112 runs scored for the loss of just one wicket – admittedly a costly one, Laura Woolvardt removed by Sophie Ecclestone. 69th over: South Africa 225-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 47) Sophie Ecclestone makes a quick return and asks for a check of the old ball, which still has 10 overs or so to run. This is the last over before tea and it’s a welcome maiden for England, with both batters poised just short of half-centuries. 68th over: South Africa 225-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 47) The first few drops of rain in the air as Charlie Dean seeks a breakthrough before tea. Luus chops a wider ball from outside off stump which trundles all the way to the rope. 67th over: South Africa 220-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 42) The floodlights flicker into life with tea approaching. Filer’s first ball gets the tiniest edge from Kapp and runs beyond the diving Jones and on to the boundary. A shorter ball is punished, sent crashing through a big gap at mid-on. 66th over: South Africa 212-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 40) The umpires – who are both officiating their first Test match – call for the light meter, and decide it’s fine to continue. Dean takes on her eighth over, and Kapp nudges the accelerator with back-to-back boundaries. 65th over: South Africa 203-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 31) Time for something different, thinks Heather Knight, and brings in Lauren Filer for Ecclestone. Filer took out Annerie Dercksen earlier in the innings but can’t trouble the batters, who look more perturbed by the dark clouds and brisker breeze. 64th over: South Africa 202-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 30) At short leg, a helmeted Tammy Beaumont tries to gee up her teammates. A single each is taken from an eclectic Charlie Dean over. 63rd over: South Africa 200-3 (Luus 41, Kapp 29) Two slips pay close attention as Ecclestone seeks Kapp’s outside edge. The hosts sail on, a couple of runs off the last ball bringing up 200. If these two can get to tea together, South Africa might feel they’re gaining an edge. 62nd over: South Africa 198-3 (Luus 41, Kapp 27) Foreboding clouds in the distance, but still no hint of rain over the Mangaung Oval. Dean continues, and her first ball is smacked away by Luus to bring the deficit below 200 runs. 61st over: South Africa 194-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 27) A costly misfield leaks four runs to take the shine off another probing over from Ecclestone, the last ball turning with intent. 60th over: South Africa 190-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 23) A maiden from Charlie Dean, who causes Luus some problems with a couple of squirming deliveries, one of which pops up off the batter’s leg and through the slips. 59th over: South Africa 190-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 23) We’re in a bit of a holding pattern here, with neither England’s pair of spinners nor South Africa’s batters quite ready to move up a gear. Marizanne Kapp picks her moment against Ecclestone, a clinical cover drive taking this partnership past 50. There’s a break in play while Sune Luus gets treatment from the physio. She seems to have a problem with her left hamstring, hopefully nothing too serious. 58th over: South Africa 186-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 19) England continue with spin from both ends, although Dean can’t quite match Ecclestone’s efficiency (then again, few can). Luus pounces on a short one, then a wider delivery skids past Jones’ fingers for four byes. 57th over: South Africa 178-3 (Luus 33, Kapp 19) Ecclestone tries a floatier ball and offers a wry smile as Luus leaves it well alone. Luus nurdles a single off the final ball to deny the England bowler a maiden. 56th over: South Africa 177-3 (Luus 32, Kapp 19) Oof, a lovely shot from Luus, waiting patiently before sending a fuller Dean delivery whistling through the off side. Some darker clouds on the horizon now; the forecast suggests a shower may be on the way. 55th over: South Africa 172-3 (Luus 27, Kapp 19) Another tight over from Ecclestone, yielding just one run as both batters fail to pick out the gaps quite as efficiently. 54th over: South Africa 171-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 19) Hitting the middle of the day’s play and it’s finely poised. South Africa have kept up a steady run rate around 3.2 an over, which is bettered here as Kapp drills one through midwicket. Off Dean’s last of the over, she gets underneath it slightly but it drops short of the fielder at mid-on. 53rd over: South Africa 167-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 15) Knight has brought fielders in, with Kapp and Luus trying to pick the gaps carefully. Just one run off the over, via a Dean misfield. Time for drinks with the clouds drifting in, but temperatures still above 30 degrees in Bloemfontein. 52nd over: South Africa 166-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 14) Thanks, Tanya. Heather Knight wants to disrupt this promising partnership and turns to Charlie Dean. Sune Luus picks off one that strays off line and flicks it nonchalantly to the boundary. 51st over: South Africa 162-3 (Luus 22, Kapp 14) An unexpectedly expensive over from Ecclestone. Luus picks up four with an edge over the slips and Kapp adds to the bounty, flicking past Jones. And with that I will hand over to Niall, who will take you through to stumps. Thanks for the messages – bye! 50th over: South Africa 153-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 10) Kapp making merry, takes two fours off Bell’s first three balls. On on point through the covers, and another cut, with fire, over point. 49th over: South Africa 145-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 2) One from more immaculate Ecclestone. 48th over: South Africa 144-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 1) Bell lopes in, if you can lope with speed. Long long legs, big strides: Luus plays out another – no she doesn’t – whipping four off her ankles from the last ball. 47th over: South Africa 140-3 (Luus 13, Kapp 1) The camera pans back to show the field, mottled green and yellow. A couple of singles from Ecclestone’s over. 46th over: South Africa 138-3 (Luus 12, Kapp 0) Knight tightens the screw, bringing on Bell to replace RMG. Luus nearly falls as the ball jumps just short of gully. A maiden. 45th over: South Africa 138-3 (Luus 12, Kapp 0) England are cock-a-hoop! The South African coach states into his laptop. The big one! Ecclestone strikes, the pressure telling. Wolvaardt thinks she’s got an inside edge onto the pad and is not happy, not one bit. There is, of course, no DRS for this Test, despite the fact there is for the other white ball games of this series. Cost-cutting. 44th over: South Africa 137-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 11) Brief relief from RMG, they pick up three. Clouds now visible to one side of the ground, presumably brought in with the wind. 43rd over: South Africa 134-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 8) Filer is sent to pasture for a well-earned rest, but no rest for South Africa’s batters who now get Ecclestone from the same end. In huge sunglasses she wheels in. Absolutely cracking over, a maiden. 42nd over: South Africa 134-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 8) A super ball from RMG draws Wolvaardt in, she edges awkwardly for a couple. The cameras spot a hairline crack outside the off stump. Wolvaardt thinks she’s picked up another boundary but a super bit of fielding by Bell at mid-on disappoints. 41st over: South Africa 131-2 (Wolvaardt 62, Luus 8) Filer, elbows akimbo in musical-hall style. Luus pounces on her last ball, slightly outside off stump, and cuts it for four. Filer shakes her head and mouthes a short sharp curse. 40th over: South Africa 127-2 (Wolvaardt 62, Luus 3) The wind, I’m told, is enhancing the in-swing from the end MacDonald-Gay is bowling from. Wolvaardt picks up her first runs since lunch, pulling four from a short one. Four byes fly past Amy Jones and down the leg side. 39th over: South Africa 118-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 3) The umpires flatten down the pitch where Filer has been running in with something akin to Mrs Tiggy-Winkle’s iron on a stick. Filer continues, high energy, full throttle. Filer hits Wolvaardt somewhere – arm- guts, I can’t tell – as it rips in. 38th over: South Africa 117-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 2) Ryana MacDonald-Gay takes the ball after lunch after that little pre-lunch spell from Dean. She is running into the wind which is now loud enough to crackle the microphone and ruffle the shirts and ponytails. A couple of leg byes off the over. 37th over: South Africa 115-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 2) Luus is greeted fairly early with a short snifter but is off the mark with a couple after a misfield. The players are out, we’re expecting more short stuff from Filer as she prepares to complete her over that brought about a (fractionally) early lunch with the wicket of Dercksen. A really excellent morning of hard cricket. Aggressive bowling from Filer in particular but utter concentration from South Africa, Wolvaardt brilliant and Dercksen working so hard despite being targeted. England got their reward in the last over before lunch, leaving it honours pretty much even. Time for me to grab some breakfast, back shortly. What a shame for Dercksen! She’d done so well and was four balls away from her sandwiches. But Filer well deserved the wicket – another kicking bouncer which Dercksen shuffled away from and sent high towards the cordon. Knight can only parry it with her leap but Ecclestone collects. 36.2 overs: South Africa 113-2 (Wolvaardt 58) 35th over: South Africa 113-1 (Wolvaardt 58, Dercksen 41) I take it back, this is the penultimate over, Dean drops onto the legs and Dercksen says thanks very much and shifts it away for four. 34th over: South Africa 107-1 (Wolvaardt 57, Dercksen 36) Filer, with the penultimate over before for lunch. She’s such a tricky customer, a searing yorker, which Wolvaardt keeps out. It loops over Beaumont at short leg who leaps and lands awkwardly on the hard soil. She’ll learn, say the commentators. Dercksen runs one short in a race to come back for a second and Filer finishes an eventful over with an aggressive bouncer that tempts Dercksen – but she just pulls her bat away in time. 33rd over: South Africa 105-1 (Wolvaardt 56, Dercksen 35) Charlie Dean gets a go with ten minutes until lunch, one keeps low but with a dart of the bat Wolvaardt has it covered. 32nd over: South Africa 103-1 (Wolvaardt 55, Dercksen 34) Firey Filer is back and so nearly has a wicket. After serving up a snorter which Dercksen ducks, Dercksen then plays a nothing sort of tennis shot to the next ball and gets a top edge which flies invitingly to Bell running in from the rope. But Bell, like Bambi on a newly mopped floor, is all over the place, over runs, dives and appears to miss the ball completely. Filer turns on her heel; Knight looks unimpressed. 31st over: South Africa 102-1 (Wolvaardt 55, Dercksen 33) Ooof! Wolvaardt lucky to escape as she gets an inside edge onto a ball from NSB which zips merrily between her pads but evades the stumps. Ever zen, she then calmly takes advantage and shovels her last ball through the gap for four. Illustrative stats on how South Africa’s scoring rate has been stifled: their first 50 took 14 overs, the second 50 18 overs. 31st over: South Africa 98-1 (Wolvaardt 51, Dercksen 33) A single from Ecclestone’s over. 30th over: South Africa 97-1 (Wolvaardt 50, Dercksen 33) A rogue run off NSB’s first ball disappoints the England fielders but she continues the wicket to wicket ploy to Wolvaardt. Gimlet eyed, Wolvaardt stares from beneath her green helmet, stranded for 13 balls on 49 - but here is the run! Turned off her hip for her second Test fifty. She unobtrusively raises her bat and gives her teammates a thumbs up. 29th over: South Africa 95-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) Pressure building a little on South Africa as England tighten the screw – though I think Wolvaardt is able to exist in a little calm bubble of her own. Ecclestone whistles through another maiden. 28th over: South Africa 95-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) A maiden from NSB. 27th over: South Africa 89-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) Wolvaardt presses at an Ecclestone ripper and the ball sheets off the bat and just beats the chasing MacDonald Gay to the rope. Wolvaardt in touching distance of fifty. 26th over: South Africa 89-1 (Wolvaardt 43, Dercksen 32) NSB replaces RMG, coming in now from the Willows end. The television cameras obligingly show pockets of supporters watching from under the shade of some trees. Looks pretty blissful actually, though the flags are bristling in the wind which seems as if it has picked up a little. A handful of singles from the over. 25th over: South Africa 86-1 (Wolvaardt 41, Dercksen 31) A single from Ecclestone’s over. 24th over: South Africa 85-1 (Wolvaardt 40, Dercksen 31) Four off McDonald-Gay, but not entirely convincing, as Dercksen is hurried and gets an outside edge down to the rope. There aren’t huge numbers of people watching at Bloemfontein, unless they’re hiding somewhere I can’t see. 23rd over: South Africa 81-1 (Wolvaardt 40, Dercksen 27) After three successive maidens, Ecclestone finally concedes a run – Wolvaardt licking her lips as a short one bounces invitingly in front of her, she obligingly flies it through midwicket for four. 22nd over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) A maiden from McDonald-Gay makes it two in a row for England. 21st over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) Ecclestone, such an imposing figure, whistles down another maiden. The players take drinks and I’m running to put the kettle on. 20th over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) A Wolvaardt pull behind square, easy does it with a flick of the wrists, brings up the fifty partnership. And a second four from Dercksen, through midwicket keeps up the momentum. 19th over: South Africa 67-1 (Wolvaardt 31, Dercksen 22) Ecclestone time! The hair that was loose in a pony tail has been tied up into a bun – this is where it gets serious. Wolvaardt and she are old foes. Wolvaardt meticulously watches and bats out the over. A maiden. 18th over: South Africa 67-1 (Wolvaardt 31, Dercksen 22) McDonald-Gay again, as the dog curls up next to me on the sofa after a brief forray for squirrel sniffing in the garden. Another impressive over of right-arm medium pace, she’s stemmed the run-rate where no-one else has. 17th over: South Africa 66-1 (Wolvaardt 30, Dercksen 22) Dercksen picks up four from Sciver-Brunt, but unconvincingly with an edge through the slips. And a first message drops into the inbox. Good morning Peter Dudley! ”I’m trying hard to imagine an inswinger zigzagging and my mind well and truly boggles! Now there’s a delivery we’d all love to perfect!” Hmmm, now you’ve put me on the spot maybe it was more of a zig…but it was definitely fabulous! 16th over: South Africa 62-1 (Wolvaardt 30, Dercksen 18) Knight rolls up her short sleeves, as here in Manchester the day slips into a gray dawn. A double change as 20 year old Ryana McDonald-Gay replaces Bell. She’s only 20 and this is just her fourth England game and her first Test. A neat and tidy maiden. 15th over: South Africa 62-1 (Woolvaardt 30, Dercksen 18) Heather Knight thinks it is time for a change, and switches Nat Sciver-Brunt into the attack to replace Filer. Into the grove immediately, as you’d expect from some sort of superwoman. And as I type that, she over-pitches and Dercksen thanks her with a off-drive for four – and another two balls later. She’s got impressive sang-froid this young woman. 14th over: South Africa 52-1 (Wolvaardt 29, Dercksen 10) Advantage Woolvaardt, who with text-book technique, twice drives Bell for four through the covers. And South Africa have notched up fifty in quick time. 13th over: South Africa 41-1 (Wolvaardt 19, Dercksen 10) Filer’s fourth over of the morning – I wish I could give you a mph calculation of how fast she’s bowling but I can’t see one on screen. Visibly intimidating though, rapid enough to make Dercksen back away, though she ripostes next ball by picking up four with a peachy cover drive. 12th over: South Africa 37-1 (Woolvaardt 18, Dercksen 6) Dercksen may not be used to the pace that Filer is delivering the other end but she has impressive poise. She drives Bell through the covers for four with aplomb. 11th over: South Africa 33-1 (Wolvaardt 18, Dercksen 2) Filer is finding her mojo – and delivers some spicy stuff to Dercksen. A searing bouncer to start – Derkcksen snaps back her neck to avoid being hit, her long blond hair following behind. She smiles. Another fierce bouncer follows, which Dercksen doesn’t play as well, loses sight of it, and is hit on the helmet as it flies down to the rope for four byes. Intriguing! 10th over: South Africa 28-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Dercksen 0) Bell springs in, a hop at the start of her run-up. Another smart, neat over. 9th over: South Africa 25-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Dercksen 0) Filer starts the over with a full toss which Woolvaardt drives for four, finishes with a snorting bouncer which heads for Woolvaardt’s throat and leaves her flat on her back. 8th over: South Africa 21-1 (Wolvaardt 12, Dercksen 0 ) Bosch looked all at sea for the three balls she faced, wildly wafting at the first, and nibbling obligingly to the third. An absolute beauty from Bell to finish the over, a HUGE inswinger which Dercksen left but which zig-zagged in and missed her off stump by a Christmas tree’s needle. Bosch pushes at a ball that she could have left a hundred times out of a hundred and nibbles behind. 7th over: South Africa 21-0 (Wolvaardt 12, Bosch 6) Three slips and a gully stand and wait as Lauren Filer runs in with the first ball of the day, an inswinger on the money. From there Filer is a little wayward, drifting legside. Woolvaardt nudges one of them down to the rope. The South Africans have a last gulp of water, and Heather Knight leads out her troops. They’re prodding the pitch in Bloem – yesterday there was a strong wind down the ground, today it has dropped to just a little breeze. The surface still looks wonderful for bat and ball, but yesterday’s wind took most of the moisture out of the surface and there are now a few cracks. While we wait for this Test to begin, you might (or might not) want to catch up on England’s exploits in Hamilton – a hundred for Williamson, a hamstring blow for Stokes, and another Matt-Henry snaffling for Crawley. The pictures are now beaming in from Blomfontein where the light is bright and the sun is hot. Kaya Zondo and Nono Pongolo are singing Bouchier’s praises – her 126 was the third highest score on Test debut behind Australia’s Mel Jones and Michelle Goszko. A lovely picture of Maia Bouchier and her dad Anthony, who was an investor in Wisden.com in the early days of the internet back in the early noughties. This is worth a listen from Raf and Syd on both England women’s contracts and the ECB’s new salary announcement on the Hundred where there are huge increases in pay for the top tier men, not so much for anyone else. This was Raf’s take on day one: Good morning! As schoolchildren porridge-up on the last Monday before Christmas, the Manchester sky still a long way from dawn, England and South Africa prepare for day two of the one-off Test in sunny Bloemfontein. England’s women had the best of yesterday, racking up 395 at quite the lick, with a debut Test hundred for the impressive Maia Bouchier and the quickest Test century in women’s history for Nat Sciver Brunt. South Africa fought back in the late afternoon, snipping this way and that through the late middle order and tail, and England were unable to make a breakthrough in the six overs after Heather Knight’s declaration. Action starts at 8am, in this first women’s Test in South Africa since 2002. Do join me, coffee in hand."

          "bodyText": "Righto, that’s us done here. I’ll be back for what are highly likely to be the final knockings in about twelve hours or so. Here’s the report from Hamilton as England hold their breath on Ben Stokes and his hamstring and New Zealand close in on victory. Thanks for your company, goodbye. Spare a thought for Zak Crawley, he’s been pocketed six (SIX) times out of six to Matt Henry in this series. He joins a err ‘select’ list in so doing. Ntini v Hayden, Pollock v Ganga, Hadlee v Matthews. Henry v Crawley might trump them all. The opener mustering just ten runs from the Kiwi seamer for his six dismissals. I’ve been watching Wolf Hall and am trying to crowbar a joke about Henry and the number SIX but I’ve been awake since 1am and my brain simply won’t allow it. Am sure it’s in there somewhere though. A chastening day for England, they lost Ben Stokes to what looks to be a recurrence of his hamstring injury and were then bludgeoned to all parts of Seddon Park by the New Zealand middle order. Ducket and Crawley are back in the sheds and there are two days left in the match with the weather set fair. Christmas miracle anyone? Jacob Bethell survives the final over of the day, a maiden from O’Rourke that included a beauty that angled in and seamed away at the last. That’s it, an epic day for New Zealand comes to a close. 6th over: England 18-2 (Bethell 9, Root 0) 5th over: England 18-2 (Bethell 8, Root 0) Joe Root comes back for the final over of the day. Will O’Rourke is going to bowl it. Gone x 6! Matt Henry pins Zak Crawley with his final delivery and the umpire raises the finger. Crawley was out of his crease trying to counteract the nip-backer but he misses and Henry has him once again! The review is sent for but it stays not out on Umpires call as the ball was clipping the leg stump. Crawley is clearly rattled, he stomps off shaking his head and glaring behind himself at the screen. You have to feel for him, he’s been spread on Matt Henry’s toast six times over. The game is so cruel sometimes, on another day against another bowler Crawley gets the benefit of the doubt from the umpire and survives. Not today though. Henry has his man. Bethell looks assured, leaving on length and then striding into the ball and picking up a single to cover. Ooohs and ahhhs behind the stump as Crawley leaves a couple outside off… 4th over: England 17-1 (Crawley 5, Bethell 8) Sun out at Seddon Park and shadows lengthening. Crawley attempts a flat footed drive outside off and is lucky not to chop on like his opening partner. Eeeeesh! A booming drive follows but the ball snakes between bat and pad. Brilliant maiden from Southee. Two more overs left in the day. 3rd over: England 17-1 (Crawley 5, Bethell 8) Crawley nudges a single to get off strike and away from Henry. He chooses, wisely. Shot(s)! Bethell pings two consecutive drives down the ground for four. It ain’t dull. 2nd over: England 8-1 (Crawley 4, Bethell 0) Southee has the ball full and hooping. Bethell does well to block out the final two balls of the over. The veteran has his dander up in his final Test. Ben Duckett is cleaned up by Tim Southee! More to the point he hacks a length ball on to his stumps! The ball before the opener smacked a length ball down the ground like a tracer bullet, he tried to repeat the stroke but with an angled blade and the death rattle ensued. Seddon Park stands to Tim Southee! 1st over: England 4-0 (Crawley 4, Duckett 0) Crawley is given OUT to a Matt Henry nip-backer but the review saves him! The ball tracking has the ball skimming just over the top of the bails. Breathe Zak, breathe! Fantastic first over from Henry, toying with the opener like a cat with a ball of wool. Tim Southee takes the field for his last bowling innings as a Test match cricketer. His wife and three children look on as he leads the team out and hugs each and every teammate as they stride out to the middle. Duckett and Crawley come out for England. Matt Henry licks his lips as Crawley takes his guard. Can the Kiwi seamer pocket the England opener again and make it six from six for the series? Let’s find out. Bethell picks up his third wicket in Test cricket as Henry chops on to his stumps. England’s long ordeal comes to a close in Hamilton, at least with the ball in hand. They’ll have 30 minutes or so to bat this evening as New Zealand hunt top order wickets. The target – oh just a piddling 658 runs. Southee tries in vain to muscle the ball over the rope and leave Test cricket in a blaze of glory but he doesn’t quite middle it, Zak Crawley taking the catch five metres inside the rope. Southee walks off with no histrionics at all. He’ll be out there with the ball for the final time shortly. 100th over: New Zealand 452-8 (Blundell 43, Southee 2) There’s a huge SIX smeared into the leg side… but it is from the blade of Tom Blundell. 100th over: New Zealand 444-8 (Blundell 36, Southee 1) Southee nudges a single to begin his final Test innings. Can he get the two sixes he needs to rack up the ton and go level with Adam Gilchrist? Brendon McCullum’s 107 sixes might be an ask too far… Santner clobbers Joe Root for twenty runs off four balls before hacking to Bashir at point. Stand by your beds - Here comes Tim Southee! 99th over: New Zealand 423-7 (Blundell 36, Santner 33) Santner tries to launch Bashir but can’t connect. Just a single off the over. New Zealand will have to weigh up the declaration with having a dart at England this eve whilst also maybe giving Tim Southee an opportunity to rack up 100 sixes in Test cricket. Decisions, decisions. 98th over: New Zealand 422-7 (Blundell 36, Santner 32) Bish Bash and indeed Bosh. Santner carts Potts for a four and a six into the leg side to take the lead to 626 runs. Time for a drink, why not? 97th over: New Zealand 411-7 (Blundell 36, Santner 21) Three runs off Bashir. So, doing anything nice for Christmas? 96th over: New Zealand 408-7 (Blundell 35, Santner 19) Potts stitches together a maiden. It’s been confirmed that play will start at 10:30am Local time tomorrow, half an hour earlier to make up for the wet weather earlier today. New Zealand might still be batting. 95th over: New Zealand 408-7 (Blundell 35, Santner 19) On we go. Shoaib Bashir into his 33rd over. Darts the ball in at Blundell, not allowing the batter to get under and smear him away. Matthew Potts is coming on to take the new ball out of Harry Brook’s clammy paw. 94th over: New Zealand 405-7 (Blundell 33, Santner 18) England have given Harry Brook the new ball. He’ll be telling his grandkids about this. You feel for them already. His first ball with the dark red orb is driven handsomely for four by Tom Blundell. Daft sport. 93rd over: New Zealand 398-7 (Blundell 27, Santner 17) Santner slams Bashir for four over extra cover and New Zealand’s lead is now past the 600 mark. Gulp. Only one thing for it… another over from Harry Brook. 92nd over: New Zealand 393-7 (Blundell 27, Santner 13) Harry Brook comes on to bowl his severley watered down Mike Procter filth. David Gower is gently disparaging of his bowling action on the tv commentary. Santner gets his bearings and then flames another SIX down the ground where an exuberant youth takes a catch on the grass banks and celebrates with wild abandon. Good hands tbf. 91st over: New Zealand 387-7 (Blundell 27, Santner 7) Shot! Santner plays one of the shots of the day, launching Bashir straight for SIX. Phillips tries to up the ante but can’t clear Carse on the midwicket fence. No sign of Southee, here comes Mitch Santner. 90th over: New Zealand 380-6 (Blundell 27, Phillips 3) It’s all so quiet. Two runs off Bethell. And so peaceful until… 89th over: New Zealand 378-6 (Blundell 26, Phillips 2) A couple nurdled off Bashir. 88th over: New Zealand 376-6 (Blundell 24, Phillips 1) Glenn Phillips is the new batter, wonder if Tim Southee is strapping them on as we speak. “Plenty watching the game here in rainy Bali, Bintang and book to hand.” Writes Mark Pentland. “Please explain why Pope hasn’t taken the new ball yet? Giving the spinners a go? Resting the quicks? This is painful.” The new ball can fly off the bat Mark but am not sure England’s spinners are doing much to stem the flow either. We’re very much in to declaration territory. The lead is 582 runs! The light is starting to fade, I’d be tempted to take it now and force the umpires hand, maybe England can get some respite that way. Coward, me? Mitchell holes out to a juggling Matt Potts on the wide mid-off boundary. That’s a first Test wicket for Jacob Bethell. They do all count. 87th over: New Zealand 368-5 (Mitchell 54, Blundell 24) Mitchell sweeps Bashir powerfully for four. Rehan almost loses his trews as he dives in vain to prevent it. The camera pans to Tim Southee who is in his tracksuit. Is he really not going to come in for a valedictory swipe? 86th over: New Zealand 364-5 (Mitchell 50, Blundell 24) Daryl Mitchell is so lucky not to chop a reverse-sweep onto his stumps but somehow the ball flies past the off bail without dislodging it. A couple of balls later Mitchell nurdles a single to go to fifty. He’s played very nicely and is a dangerous player to have to bowl at with a declaration on the boil. 85th over: New Zealand 361-5 (Mitchell 48, Blundell 23) Mitchell gets in on the fun, he trots out of his crease and crunches a straight SIX down the ground. India in trouble over at the Gabba. Rain and wickets falling… 84th over: New Zealand 352-5 (Mitchell 40, Blundell 22) SIX more down the ground from Blundell, England persisting with spin and the old ball. 83rd over: New Zealand 345-5 (Mitchell 39, Blundell 16) Blundell opens the shoulders, driving Bashir down the ground for four and then smearing for SIX down the ground! Twelve pilfered off the over as they take a drink in Hamilton. England need a stiff one. 82nd over: New Zealand 333-5 (Mitchell 38, Blundell 5) Glenn Phillips is padded up on the Kiwi balcony, suggesting there’s no declaration imminent. Unless it is a cunning ruse. Tim Southee, in his final Test, needs two sixes to notch 100 in Test cricket too. We might see a guard of honour for the seam bowling stalwart with bat in hand yet. 81st over: New Zealand 330-5 (Mitchell 38, Blundell 2) Plenty going on in Bashir’s latest over as Pope goes upstairs to have a look at a caught behing off a Blundell reverse-sweep. The review is still not Pope’s friend, the ball game off the batter’s toe and so England lose another. Darly Mitchell is then caught by Harry Brook at slip but the third umpire takes a look and decides it was pouched on the bounce. It was a muted appeal by Brook which suggests it could be the correct decision. On we go. 80th over: New Zealand 329-5 (Mitchell 38, Blundell 1) Bethell rattles through the 80th over but Ollie Pope ain’t interested in taking the new ball. Not yet at least. 79th over: New Zealand 327-5 (Mitchell 37, Blundell 0) One over til the new ball can be taken. Tom Blundell is the new batter, these two like batting together and England ruddy well know it. The lead is officially A LOT. Williamson holes out! A top edged sweep sees sub fielder Rehan take a decent tumbling catch. Touch of class from Ollie Pope who stops Williamson to shake him by the hand as he turns to depart. Brilliant knock. Wonderful player. Accomplished Barista. 78th over: New Zealand 325-4 (Williamson 155, Mitchell 36) The commentators go in to great detail about Kane Williamson and his passion for coffee. Apparently he’s a dab hand at ‘latte art’ and takes his own espresso machine on tour. We’re a long way from Alec Stewart and his suitcase of Heinz Baked Beans eh? 77th over: New Zealand 322-4 (Williamson 153, Mitchell 35) Runs flowing at Seddon Park. England doing well to keep chipper despite staring down the barrel and with Stokes absent. They are back on at the Gabba and India are in trouble with the bat. The man who laughs in the face of sleep, Rob Smyth, is on the tools for that one. 76th over: New Zealand 318-4 (Williamson 150, Mitchell 34) Kane Williamson goes to 150! Consecutive lofted drives off Bethell skim away to the fence and New Zealand press ever so politely on England’s throat. 75th over: New Zealand 308-4 (Williamson 142, Mitchell 32) More toil for England as three boundaries are collected off Bashir’s latest, two of them to Mitchell who dabs and reverse sweeps to the fence. Williamson picks up four of his own through cover to leave himself needing one more run to average 100 at Seddon Park. Head down for the red inker after that mind… the lead is over 500. 74th over: New Zealand 294-4 (Williamson 136, Mitchell 24) Williamson presses on the gas with his dainty size 8s. Bethell tosses up and is driven over cover for four. 73rd over: New Zealand 288-4 (Williamson 130, Mitchell 23) Bashir whirls away and is pocketed for three singles. Michael Gourlay emails in and ‘admits’ what we all knew to be true already… “I’m an Australian old enough to remember the joys of England’s Ashes trip to Australia in 1974-75 when a couple of fellows called Lillee and Thomson had some fun and the scoreline was 4-0 Australia’s way after 5 tests (from memory the Australian team gave England the 6th test to allow the English side some respectability). For some reason since then I seem to get more joy seeing England lose a test match than Australia win one. I have spent more time on this Guardian blog today than I have on Australia vs India. Also does Tom Van der Gucht win a prize for funniest blog contribution of 2024 with his “sniff of a hint of a chance” from earlier today. Maybe he’s right and Stokes will do a Glenn Maxwell and make a heroic 201 not out with a dodgy leg?” Happy to have you Michael, but how bereft will you be when England do knock these runs off and claim a new Test record? Ahem. 72nd over: New Zealand 285-4 (Williamson 129, Mitchell 22) Bethell gives it some flight and relinquishes just a couple of singles off the over. England are plugging away but New Zealand hold all the cards, the lead is approaching 500 and there are two full days and a session left in the match. 71st over: New Zealand 283-4 (Williamson 128, Mitchell 21) Mitch Santner will be peering down through his Deidre Barlow varifocals at this pitch with some interest. It’s starting to break up a little and offer some some sharp turn. 70th over: New Zealand 280-4 (Williamson 127, Mitchell 19) Nearly! Bethell from the other end and he gets some turn and bounce off the wicket, the advancing Williamson has to use every ounce of his hand/eye coordination to get bat on ball at the last and dab away. A stumping looked very much in the offing. Williamson offers the bowler an apologetic shrug and a smile. 69th over: New Zealand 276-4 (Williamson 124, Mitchell 18) Shoaib Bashir starts the session and there’s a vociferous appeal first ball for an lbw to Williamson. Pope sends it upstairs but there’s nowt doing for England as the impact was way outside off. The players return to the field in watery sunshine as Ali sends an official update on the Stokes injury situation: Ben Stokes Update England captain Ben Stokes, who left the field during the middle session on day three of the third Test at Seddon Park, is currently receiving treatment for a left hamstring issue. He will not return to the field in this innings and will undergo further assessment to determine his availability to bat in England’s second innings.” A word on Kane Williamson, who went to his 33rd Test century in that session. Take a look at his record on home turf, don’t read on if you are susceptible to nose bleeds. 52 Matches 20 Hundreds Average: 67.22 I would direct you over the ditch to Brisbane for Australia v India but it turns out that it is chucking it down at the Gabba. What’s with all this Antipodean precipitation? 68th over: New Zealand 274-4 (Williamson 123, Mitchell 18) Bethell is bowling a leg stump line, Williamson sweeps fine, very fine, the ball races away for four but is given as byes. Hard lines, Kane. That’s tea, folks. 36 overs in the session, 138 runs added by New Zealand for just one wicket, Rachin Ravindra. The more seismic news as far as England are concerned is the fact Ben Stokes looks to have done his hamstring once again. Rotten luck for the England captain. The lead stands at a chunky 478 runs as Williamson and Mitchell amble off the park to put their feet up for 20 minutes. 67th over: New Zealand 265-4 (Williamson 119, Mitchell 17) Bashir drops short and Williamson doesn’t miss out, rocking back and splatting through square leg for four. We’ll have one more over before tea and Jacob Bethell is going to bowl it. 66th over: New Zealand 259-4 (Williamson 113, Mitchell 17) Potts is on the button, just a single off his latest as the respite of the tea break approaches for England. 65th over: New Zealand 258-4 (Williamson 112, Mitchell 17) A paddle sweep from Mitchell sees him pick up a clever boundary and he follows up with a reverse for four more. England hurting, the runs taking New Zealand out of sight and they’ve lost their captain to what looks like a bad recurrence of his hamstring injury. Merry bloody Christmas. 64th over: New Zealand 250-4 (Williamson 112, Mitchell 9) Potts steams in and nearly picks up Williamson, the ball sticking in the pitch slightly as the batter’s booming drive whistles in the air just out of reach for a return catch. *Andrex soft hands from Kane as he glides down to deep third and Mitchell swats a single into the leg side to take the lead to 450. *Other loo roll is available but might not be as double quilted as Kane Williamson’s late cut. 63rd over: New Zealand 248-4 (Williamson 111, Mitchell 8) Williamson cuts for a couple off Bashir to take the lead past 450. Just one more single off the over with a nurdle into the covers. It’s gone a bit gloomy again in Hamilton, anoraks and fleeces being reached for on the grass banks. 62nd over: New Zealand 245-4 (Williamson 108, Mitchell 8) Mitchell tickles Potts off his hip and away for four. He then goes for a wild drive but connects only with fresh Hamilton air. Mitchell reins himself in a little and Potts joins the dots for the rest of the over. 61st over: New Zealand 241-4 (Williamson 108, Mitchell 4) Sharp turn from Bashir albeit from way outside off stump, Williamson is surprised and gets a glove on it as it spits back at him. Harry Brook wrong-footing himself in anticipation and the ball ploops into the void between his left hand and Pope’s right. Two runs collected and the lead up to 445 for the home side. 60th over: New Zealand 239-4 (Williamson 106, Mitchell 4) Daryl ‘Moose’ Mitchell is not who you want to see striding to the middle with your side 430-odd runs to the pump and with your talismanic captain off the field injured. He duly clubs Potts over cover for four runs off his second ball. Ouch. Pope has seen enough of Bethell’s left arm darts and calls for the robustly derrière-ed Matt Potts. It pays off immediately as Ravindra spoons a leading edge to Carse at mid-off! It was a very expansive shot he was attempting, trying to work a ball a foot outside off stump over midwicket with a helicopter flourish. Potts clearly thought so too as he did a double fist pump and gave Ravindra a bit of a glare and a send off. The Durham seamer’s ticker is ticking. 59th over: New Zealand 235-3 (Williamson 105, Ravindra 42) Spoiler alert, Virat Kohli has just got out over in Brisbane but the last few weeks have seen each member of the ‘Fab Four’ notch a ton. The guard isn’t changing just yet. Bashir gets some bounce and turn to Ravindra, the batter getting in a tizz as he comes out of his ground and then has to change his shot as Bashir sees him coming. 58th over: New Zealand 232-3 (Williamson 105, Ravindra 42) Kane Williamson goes to his 33rd Test century by lofting Jacob Bethell down the ground for SIX! He raises his arms in as undemonstrative fashion as possible and embraces his partner in batting. That’s his seventh ton on this ground too, he averages a lick over 97 at Seddon Park. He dances down to drive Bashir for four more, maybe New Zealand have got the declaration on the mind? 57th over: New Zealand 220-3 (Williamson 94, Ravindra 41) Ollie Pope takes the captaincy reins once more as New Zealand’s lead stretches to 424. Ravindra cuts Bashir for four and then carts a shorter ball away for SIX over midwicket. England will now need to pull off the highest fourth innings chase in Test history. No, you stop it. 56th over: New Zealand 210-3 (Williamson 94, Ravindra 31) Jacob Bethell finishes Stokes’ over with some serviceable left-arm spin. There’s a grim hush around Seddon Park, such rotten luck for Ben Stokes. Fingers crossed it was more of a twinge than a tear. Gah! Horrible moments in Hamilton as Ben Stokes pulls out of his 12th over clutching his hamstring, the same one that’s he worked so hard to come back from after injuring it in August. Really hope that isn’t a tear but it did look that way, Stokes looked absolutely gutted as he made his way off the park. 55th over: New Zealand 201-3 (Williamson 91, Ravindra 25) Williamson goes back to cut Bashir and gets another thick edge that races away for four this time. He’s into the 90s and New Zealand’s lead is over 400. 54th over: New Zealand 197-3 (Williamson 87, Ravindra 25) Thanks Rob and hello all. Christmas tree twinklin’ and coffee slurpin’ here in South London. Could be a Nirvana t-shirt… Stokes bustles in and slams one short, Kane Williamson gets a meaty edge on it off an attempted pull and is DROPPED by Pope behind the stumps! Tough chance diving away to his left down the leg side, needed it to stick in the webbing but tipped it round the post instead. Stokes flashes a wry smile. 53rd over: New Zealand 195-3 (Williamson 86, Ravindra 24) Williamson, so quick on his feet against Bashir, skids back to push a single to mid-off. I was going to say he was hitting against the spin but then I remember Duncan Fletcher’s geometry lesson. I wonder what Fletcher would make of Bashir. He wouldn’t care much for his batting, that’s for sure, or for the long hop that Ravindra has just carted for four. That’s the first really bad ball from Bashir today. Right, it’s time for me to tag in Jim Wallace for the rest of the day. Bye! 52nd over: New Zealand 187-3 (Williamson 85, Ravindra 17) Carse off, Stokes on, with a slip and gully in place for Williamson. This is his 35th over of the game, the most he’s bowled since the Trent Bridge Test of 2022. That’s a really encouraging sign for England ahead of their big year. Williamson works a single off the pads. I doubt Stokes will mind this as he’ll want an early crack at Ravindra. After timing a square drive that doesn’t beat one of the three men in the covers, Ravindra chases a less full delivery and is beaten. Clever bowling. 51st over: New Zealand 186-3 (Williamson 84, Ravindra 17) Williamson charges Bashir, gets nowhere near the pitch and drags a one-handed chip shot that barely clears the leaping Carse at midwicket. That was similar to the near miss in Bashir’s previous over, only closer to the field. Stokes might have caught it that time. It was another nice piece of bowling from Bashir, who has been good this morning. The end of the over is the cue for the drinks break in this extended afternoon session. “The DRS setup doubtless overcompensates for certainty mainly because they need to be absolutely sure. It’s not like the whole of the ball over the whole of the line in footy, as that can be objectively measured. The umpire’s call option also has to be thorough for the same reason. Fair enough?” Absolutely. The technology isn’t 100 per cent accurate so you need some margin for error; I just wonder whether it could be slightly smaller. Then again, average scores are going down and Test cricket has never been more entertaining, so maybe we don’t need more tinkering. I can see both sides!! 50th over: New Zealand 180-3 (Williamson 80, Ravindra 15) The Carse-Ravindra contest resumes – but only for two balls, with Ravindra taking a quick single on the off side. There was a whiff of a run-out chance but Williamson made his ground, and the throw missed anyway. Carse decides to continue round the wicket to the right-handed Williamson, which is rare a sign of benevolent intent. Williamson pulls a single to bring up a fifty partnership that he has dominated. That might be it for Carse after a menacing spell of 5-1-13-0. 49th over: New Zealand 176-3 (Williamson 79, Ravindra 13) Four from the over, which extends the lead to precisely 380. 48th over: New Zealand 172-3 (Williamson 77, Ravindra 11) Carse, and I say this with only love, can be a nasty piece of work with the ball in hand. He’s doing everything he can to unsettle Ravindra, who ignores the sledging and then pulls majestically in front of square for four. That’s the cue for Carse to give him an even bigger mouthful. “That ball was smashing middle and leg,” says Brian Withington. “‘Umpire’s call’ is what needs trimming.” Could you make the margin of error a third rather than half? Would that work? I’m loath to jump to prescriptions because I know the square root of bugger all about how the technology works, particularly how reliable it is (and therefore the minimum margin of error that is required). Meanwhile, things are happening in Brisbane… 47th over: New Zealand 168-3 (Williamson 77, Ravindra 7) Williamson dances down to flick Bashir over midwicket for four, though it didn’t clear the leaping fielder by much. It was Ben Stokes, trying to pull off another of his ‘no, no way’ catches. 46th over: New Zealand 163-3 (Williamson 73, Ravindra 6) A maiden from Carse, who is back at it after a relatively poor first-innings performance. Williamson is not out! He was hit just above the kneeroll as he tried to play back. Here comes the replay… yep, umpire’s call. It was more than just a bail-trimmer so Carse might feel slightly aggrieved. England review! Williamson survives a huge LBW shout after being smacked on the pad by a big nipbacker from Carse. England are going upstairs. It’s all about the bounce; my hunch is this’ll be umpire’s call and therefore not out. 45th over: New Zealand 163-3 (Williamson 73, Ravindra 6) Bashir has a slip and leg slip for Ravindra, with a tight line from round the wicket. Ravindra skids back to take a cut off middle stump, though he doesn’t beat the cover fielder. It feels like something has to give here; Ravindra, such a beautiful strokeplayer, is 6 not out from 42 balls. 44th over: New Zealand 162-3 (Williamson 72, Ravindra 6) Carse goes round the wicket to Ravindra, who shows good judgement to leave a ball angled back into him. Carse has a few words, trying to rip Ravindra from his bubble. It works, albeit without the reward England wanted, when Ravindra throws his hands at the next ball and drags it back down the pitch. I suspect he would have left that had Carse said nothing to him. 43rd over: New Zealand 161-3 (Williamson 71, Ravindra 6) Ravindra pushes tentatively at Bashir and edges wide of slip for a couple. There’s some bit for Bashir and he looks quite threatening, especially to the left-handed Ravindra. 42nd over: New Zealand 159-3 (Williamson 71, Ravindra 4) A double bowling change, as is Ben Stokes’ wont at the moment, with Carse on for Atkinson. Williamson tries to attack a short ball, gets in an ungainly position and slashes it over gully for four. He has another moment of fortune when he tries to cut a ball that is too close for the shot and whooshes past the stumps. A promising start from Carse, who like O’Rourke should be an unpleasant proposition on this slightly uneven pitch. 41st over: New Zealand 155-3 (Williamson 67, Ravindra 4) Shoaib Bashir comes on for Potts, probably with the left-handed Ravindra in mind more than Williamson. That said, his fourth ball growls towards Williamson from well outside off stump. A less accomplished batsman would probably have dragged that onto the stumps. Williamson managed to jump back in his crease and force it out of harm’s way. 40th over: New Zealand 151-3 (Williamson 64, Ravindra 3) Now Williamson has to deal with some low bounce from Atkinson, jabbing down on a ball that might otherwise have disturbed his furniture. If England knew the bounce would be this uneven on the third morning they would surely have batted first. 39th over: New Zealand 151-3 (Williamson 64, Ravindra 3) The commentator’s curse almost strikes when Williamson fresh-airs an attempted cut off Potts. Their head-to-head record, since you asked, is now 28 runs and four wickets. Williamson was three for the before this gme. 38th over: New Zealand 150-3 (Williamson 63, Ravindra 3) Ravindra, who remains almost strokeless against the fuller ball, comes to life when Atkinson digs one in. But his attempted pull stroke is mistimed and dribbles to midwicket. Another maiden. Ravindra has 3 from 25 balls, a sign of his determination to make his first significant score of the series. Williamson has 63 from 79 and is making batting look easy. 37th over: New Zealand 150-3 (Williamson 63, Ravindra 3) An errant short ball from Potts is helped round the corner for four more by Williamson. He looks nailed on for a century, though I thought the same in both innings at Christchurch and it didn’t happen. Potts’ last delivery spits unpleasantly at Williamson, who does superbly to get on top of the ball and drop it safely on the off side. Honestly, the thought of facing Will O’Rourke on this pitch, chasing 500+ to win… 36th over: New Zealand 146-3 (Williamson 59, Ravindra 3) The ball isn’t moving as much as England would have hoped with the floodlights on, especially after Potts’ first ball of the day promised so much. Nothing much happens in Atkinson’s second over, just a single to Williamson. New Zealand lead by 350. 35th over: New Zealand 145-3 (Williamson 58, Ravindra 3) Ravindra, who has given his wicket away a few times in this series, looks determined to do it right this time. Potts tries to tempt him outside off stump on at least three occasions but he’s having none of it; the result is a maiden. 34th over: New Zealand 145-3 (Williamson 58, Ravindra 3) Ravindra pulls his hand off the bat after being surprised by some extra bounce from Atkinson. The bounce is already a bit uneven, so facing Will O’Rourke in the fourth innings should be a laugh riot. That bounce is a lot less treacherous when it’s wide of off stump. Potts fed Williamson in the previous over; now Atkinson does likewise and is cut for four. 33rd over: New Zealand 140-3 (Williamson 54, Ravindra 2) Potts’ first ball is a jaffa that straightens sharply to beat Williamson’s defensive push. Never mind Gary Cooper: whatever happened to the loosener? Williamson gets the first runs of the day, four of them, with a fast-handed cut stroke. That’s it for the over. There’s been no further rain in Hamilton, your honour, so play is about to resume. With the floodlights on, it should be a decent time to bowl. Matthew Potts will have first crck. Radio song “While we’re waiting, a reminder for folks, like me, wanting to hear radio coverage while abroad,” begins Mark Zip. “Guerilla Cricket is available worldwide and not geo-blocked. They are on TuneIn, YouTube, SimpleRadio, GuerillaCricket.com and, no doubt, many more places. Good commentary, fun banter, jingles!” Play is underway in Brisbane, where – hock, shorror – Jasprit Bumrah has taken his sixth wicket. And Alex Carey, who has quietly had an excellent 2024, has raced to a 53-ball half-century. “I would like to point out to Phil Withall that if he’s cleared his day for Test cricket and that is looking dodgy, he doesn’t have to do something productive,” writes Ian. “As a recent early retiree may I suggest he picks up some nibbles and booze and spends the day re-watching classic movies such as Zulu, A Bridge Too Far, Die Hard (it’s nearly Christmas), Gremlins, Airplane, whatever takes his fancy. You know I’m right :-).” Das Boot? Actually, Phil, Ian, everyone watch Kneecap! You’ll either love it or detest it. But if you love it, you’ll be smiling for a week. “While we’re waiting,” writes Tom Hopkins, “could we check whether Tom Van der Gucht has tried any more baking since his crumble triumph?” Well, TVdG? Afternoon session 12.30am-3.10am Evening session 3.30am-5.30am (doesn’t include the extra half hour for slow over rate) Hamilton is 13 hours ahead. “Having worked over the weekend, and been so busy I didn’t get to check the first day score until close of play, I have a day off, cleared to do nothing but enjoy Test matches,” begins Phil Withall. “Thanks to the wonderful weather, it’s starting to look like I may actually have to do something productive.” If you’re at a loose end I’ve got a tax return that just oozes potential productivity. It’s a little brighter in Brisbane, apparently, so we might have even play in both Test matches. “It’s almost Christmas and I’m feeling sentimental, so I was wondering if it rains long enough, could England consider playing for a draw like the old times?” wonders Angus King. “Sclerotic run rates and Beckettian melancholy would really gladden this old timer’s heart. And what is the B*****l equivalent of Is It Cowardly To Pray For Rain?” That’s a great question. Erm, It Is Cowardly To Pray For Rain? An update from Ali. An early lunch will be taken at 12.30pm local time (11.30pm GMT), and if there’s no further rain play will begin an hour later: 1.30pm local time/12.30am GMT. With that, I’m going to head off for whatever constitutes lunch at this hour. See you in a bit. Australia v India, day three Play is due to begin in Brisbane in just under 40 minutes. ‘Due’ being the operative word because it’s hooning down there as well. “Please tell Thomas I hold my hand up, I got it wrong,” writes Kim Thonger. “I withdraw zero and offer instead very few Germans are interested in cricket. My attacking game relies too heavily on hyperbole. Shamefaced, I trudge back to the pavilion, the dismissal going in the book as Hit Wicket b Meehan.” I’ve just seen the official scorecard, which, in a controversial development, reads Thonger b Thonger -1. It’s the first negative score in cricket history and the first time a player has dismissed themselves. More news as we get it. Precipitation (4) The rain is a bit lighter but, even so, my flabber will be aghast if there’s any play before lunch. “It seems unlikely,” begins Tom Van der Gucht, and he’s not kidding. “But if England can take advantage of the cloud cover to roll over the Black Caps for 50, and with Crawley due a triple century to push his average back into the low 30s and cement his place in the team until after the Ashes, then maybe, just maybe, England have what Dave Podmore would describe as a sniff of a hint of a chance. That’s all Stokes needs...” Actually, while I wouldn’t give England tuppence here, I spent yesterday/earlier today looking back at some of their acts of escapology in the first Bazball summer. I didn’t give them tuppence in these games either. New Zealand, Lord’s NZ effectively 242 for 4 in their second innings. England win by five wickets New Zealand, Trent Bridge England 93 for 4, chasing 299. England win by five wickets New Zealand, Headingley England 55 for 6 in their first innings, still 274 runs behind. England win by seven wickets India, Edgbaston India effectively 285 for three in their second innings. England win by seven wickets We didn’t know we were born. “Morning Rob,” writes Thomas Meehan. “I can confirm that some Germans are cricket fans. Johanna, my houseguest from a few years ago and a champion Sportlerin herself, was very keen on seeing a game; her partner Richy possibly less so. Unfortunately it was out of season so instead we wandered down the hill to Coogee Oval to watch Randwick play.” Bad news from Hamilton “It is now raining again and the covers are coming back on...” writes Ali. Good news from Hamilton “Interestingly, we have some peelage of the covers occurring.,” writes Ali Martin. “Bethell, Stone, Root, Anderson playing a game of keepy ups in front of the pavilion.” “High praise for Will O’Rourke, but well-earned I feel, as he has a bit of Courtney Walsh about his action and the deceptive nastiness of his short ball,” writes Gary Naylor. “The difference in age between 21 and 23 is a lot more than that between 31 and 33 in Test cricket, but Jacob Bethell (21) looked very raw indeed against O’Rourke (23) yesterday. “Strokemaking for a batter is like shot-stopping for a goalkeeper – eye-catching, but if they couldn’t do it, they wouldn’t be a pro. Whether young Bethell can go on to master the equivalent of goalkeeper commanding his box through anticipation, footwork and personality remains to be seen – going to be fun finding out though, isn’t it?” Walsh is a good comparison; like O’Rourke, his angles were awkward and he got the ball to follow right-handers. The other bowler he reminds me of is peak Steve Harmison. I think that’s slightly harsh on Bethell. The shot to get out was poor, but then so were Brook’s and Root’s and they hadn’t been worked over. Before that he dealt pretty well with a couple of really horrible throat balls. Don’t forget that O’Rourke roughed up Ben Stokes even more emphatically in the previous Test. That said, it did give me pause over Bethell’s potential role in the top three against India and Australia. For now he’s first reserve and I wouldn’t deviate from that. In the long term I’d put him my house on him making it; he’s the best under-23 England batter since Joe Root. And he’ll have learned so much from these three Tests. “One of those days,” writes Ali Martin, our main at Seddon Park. “Bit of rain first thing and now sort of overcast, dank and spotting. And as I type that a droplet lands on my phone screen fhremmajsnslrh.” England Women are also in action against South Africa in Bloemfontein. On the first day of their one-off Test, Maia Bouchier made a charming debut century and Nat Sciver-Brunt reaffirmed her all-time greatness. Her consistent brilliance, particularly with the bat, is mind-blowing. The weather forecast is better after lunch so I’m sure there will be plenty of play. If not, there’s always Australia v India at the Gabba. Hang on, the forecast is iffy there as well. “Evening Rob,” writes Kim Thonger. “I’ve spent the last couple of days in Germany. Even though a large proportion of Germans are sports mad, I can confirm what we all knew. Nobody has the slightest interest in cricket of any sort. “I’ve been pondering, could it be that those responsible for preparing school playing fields have always been horrified by the imperial measurements used to create pitches and equipment? “For example. Here is a list of imperial measurements used in cricket and their metric conversions: Cricket pitch Length 22 yards (66 feet) is approximately 20.12 meters Cricket pitch Width 10 feet is approximately 3.05 meters Boundary distance Typically ranges from 50 to 90 yards, equivalent to 45.72 to 82.29 meters Bat length Maximum of 38 inches, which is about 96.52 centimeters. Ball weight Between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces, or approximately 156 to 163 grams “If we compromised slightly – for example, the pitch could be 20x3m – maybe ground staff in the village of Gschlachtenbretzingen, located in Baden-Württemberg (it really exists), might be less reticent?” Nobody in Germany is interested in cricket? Tell that to Ben Kohler-Cadmore! It’s raining in Hamilton so play won’t start at 10pm GMT as scheduled. I have no idea what else to tell you. I’m with Colly. Though England weren’t great yesterday, the game turned on a spell of fast bowling from Will O’Rourke that any of the great West Indians of the 1980s would have been proud to bowl. Oh well! England’s hopes of a 3-0 series win were smashed to smithereens by Will O’Rourke and friends on the second day in Hamilton. Now they – and we, although I suppose you are free to go to bed if you like – must endure the admin of defeat. For the next couple of sessions, England’s bowlers are likely get an insight into how Sisyphus felt. New Zealand will resume on 136 for three, a lead of 340, with Kane Williamson on 50 and Rachin Ravindra on 2. England will tell themselves they can chase anything. But even in Test cricket’s year of the unexpected, an England win feels impossible. That doesn’t mean today’s play has no value. It’s a particularly important day for Shoaib Bashir, who is having a poor end to a largely excellent first year in Test cricket. Bashir is probably England’s greatest concern ahead of their big year. He looks tired, mentally rather than physically, and a few months off will do him good. Bashir can still end on a high. A three-for would make him the second youngest bowler to take 50 Test wickets in a calendar year (the youngest was Kapil Dev in 1979). Even allowing for the inordinate volume of Test cricket that England have played it would be a lovely achievement and a reminder – to us and more importantly to Bashir – that what he has achieved is not remotely normal."

          "headline": "‘A little magic’: fantasy flight takes kids to North Pole scene in Denver airport",
          "bodyText": "The children’s faces were pure excitement on Saturday as they stepped off a United Airlines flight after landing at the North Pole. Well, not the real North Pole, but don’t tell the children that. United partnered with five charitable organizations in the Denver, Colorado, area to ferry more than 100 children on a 45-minute flight to a hangar outside Denver international airport that had been transformed into the North Pole by United employees and volunteers. During the flight, personnel paraded up and down the aisles with bubble machines as kids squealed: “Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles!” Streamers, paper snowflakes and tufts of cotton resembling feathery snow dotted the plane and seats. Holiday songs played in the background and there were apple snacks and juice for all. Before landing, the children were asked to close their window shades as they were told they were flying over Canada en route to Santa’s workshop. When they arrived, children were met by the sight of a waiting Santa and Mrs Claus and a host of elves. An ice cream truck was on hand and all the children received gifts. Bryce Bosley, six, was tickled to see Santa and all the North Pole had to offer. “The North Pole is fun because there’s games, food, and all the activities are really fun,” he said. United Capt Bob Zimmermann, the holiday flight’s pilot, was struck by the joy and wonder of the youngsters. “Throughout the year I’ll think of the fantasy flight,” he said. “When life seems to get tough or I want to complain about something, I remember these kids and the joy and the love and what this feels like, and it just keeps my life in perspective.” More than 200 United employees volunteered for the event, the Denver Gazette reported, helping the holiday spirit take over the gate, plane and hangar. The volunteering employees also each “adopted” a child, buying gifts for them as a secret Santa. United partnered with Make-A-Wish Colorado, Girls Inc, Children’s Hospital Colorado and Rocky Mountain Down Syndrome Association to invite Denver-area kids ages three to 10 years on the flight. For more than 30 years, United has staged its annual Fantasy Flights to fictional North Poles at airports around the world to bring holiday cheer to children and their families. The program “is life-changing for wish kids and their families”, said Leslie Motter, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish America. “We are deeply grateful for United’s ongoing partnership and dedication to making a lasting impact in the lives of children with critical illnesses.” This year the Fantasy Flights took place in 13 cities, starting on 5 December in Honolulu and then in Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Cleveland and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the island of Guam. Newark, New Jersey, also had a flight on Saturday. Jonna McGrath, United’s vice-president for operations at its Denver hub, has participated in 29 flights and said it is one of her favorite days of the year. “It gives them a day where they are away from some of the challenges they face in their day-to-day life,” said McGrath, who was dressed as an elf. “Bringing a little magic and some gifts to their holiday season is something they’ll never forget.” Rusti Rhodes, a flight attendant with United for 27 years who was speaking to the Denver Gazette, has only been able to participate in the Fantasy Flight program twice because spots fill up immediately. “It’s very coveted,” she said. “You really got to watch out for your mascara. It gets emotional,” said Rhodes. “Everyone’s position can get stale once in a while. But with the way these kids’ faces light up, they make you think you have the absolute best job in the world.” Employees could be seen dancing, singing and smiling ear-to-ear at the flight gate. “It truly is such an amazing experience. You really just try to get it every year,” Rhodes said. “We all do hundreds of flights every year. This one takes the top.”"

          "headline": "Australia v India: third men’s cricket Test, day two – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Thank you for joining us today. Just a reminder that play will start 30 minutes earlier than usual tomorrow (9:50 local time / 10:50 AEDT) weather permitting. Expect some early declaration speculation and plenty of nervous glances towards the rain radar. Just a word on over-rates. Today’s play started 30 minutes earlier than usual, ended 30 minutes later than scheduled, featured Ravindra Jadeja bowling 16 of the quickest overs you could imagine, and the fall of just seven wickets – and yet still only 88 overs were eked out. This is two fewer than expected on a normal day, never mind one expected to feature 98 overs to make up play lost yesterday to rain. An engrossing opening session gave way to an Australian avalanche as Travis Head and Steve Smith batted the home side into a dominant position at the end of day two of the Third Test. Jasprit Bumrah (5/72) played an increasingly familiar lone hand, stemming the flow with the second new ball, but India looked tired in the field and Rohit Sharma bereft of inspiration as captain. All eyes turn now to the skies with rain forecast on each of the three remaining days. Will Australia have enough time to force victory or can India escape with a draw? 101st over: Australia 405-7 (Carey 45, Starc 7) Akash replaces Jadeja in the attack, one suspects in a bid by Rohit to ensure this is the final over of the day. Australia nurdle a couple of singles then Carey goes walkabout again, failing to connect on this occasion. Another couple of singles, then time-wasting from both sides to see the clock tick beyond 5:50pm and closing time. 100th over: Australia 401-7 (Carey 44, Starc 5) A two then a one from Starc, dead batting into the off side brings up Australia’s 400. With just three days remaining and rain forecast, it’s impossible to see them losing from this position, but will they have the time to force through a victory? 99th over: Australia 397-7 (Carey 43, Starc 2) Jadeja does his best to race through his work and keep Australia quiet but after three dots Carey lap sweeps for four with beautiful touch, then batters a slog sweep over cow corner for a barbarous six! 98th over: Australia 387-7 (Carey 33, Starc 2) Starc off the mark with a couple down to third. Siraj finally has his first wicket of the Test, a regulation nick behind from a back of a length delivery. It arrives the ball after conceding five wides for a tennis ball bouncer. He barely celebrates. India are cooked. 97th over: Australia 378-6 (Carey 33, Cummins 18) This partnership is now into the 50s, and it has been very handy indeed, coming at a run-a-ball, advancing Australia just when India threatened to be clawing their way back into the contest. Rohit turns to Jadeja to wrestle back some control, and he does the job, going for just a single, despite Carey attempting a Pant-like reverse slog. 96th over: Australia 377-6 (Carey 33, Cummins 17) Carey calls Cummins through for a quick single but he would have run out his skipper had Siraj hit the stumps with a creative flick in his follow through. Another questionable Carey call next ball invites confusion in the middle, and this time Siraj hurls at the stumps, misses the lot, and concedes an overthrow. Very end of day areas at the Gabba. Carey changes the mood with another dance down the track. Siraj spots it, digs it in, but the keeper was committed and swats a pull-drive over long-on for four! That was a remarkable passage of play. A high quality late-cut makes it two boundaries in the over as Carey gallops into the 30s. 95th over: Australia 365-6 (Carey 23, Cummins 16) Gorgeous cover drive for four – all-run! – from Cummins, latching onto some length from Nitish with Carey running smartly, recognising the likely boundary was going to hold up on the soft outfield. 94th over: Australia 360-6 (Carey 22, Cummins 12) Siraj coms into the attack and lands four deliveries in the right areas. Carey then ventures on one of his periodic journeys down the pitch and slashes three into the offside. This day’s play is really petering out. Neither side is making much of an effort to keep the pace of the game up, the crowd is making that restless hum, and with the cloud cover coming over it all feels like everyone would be better shaking hands and coming back tomorrow. 93rd over: Australia 355-6 (Carey 19, Cummins 11) Following another drinks break there are just 43 minutes left in the day, and none of Australia’s top order are in their whites up on the balcony, so I think we can rule out a declaration this evening. Nitish takes over from Bumrah and Australia work five runs with little fuss. The final of those was courtesy of a misfield from Akash, demonstrating how tired and weary India are starting to look in the field. It’s been a long day for them, but they’ve only bowled 80 overs. I long for the over-rate revolution. 92nd over: Australia 351-6 (Carey 16, Cummins 9) Cummins again almost drives to gully, this time off Akash, who also gets one to seam and swing back into Carey and cause the Australian keeper some discomfort. As he did two overs ago, Carey responds by sashaying down he pitch and long-handling a length ball, but he doesn’t middle it and has to settle for two. 91st over: Australia 348-6 (Carey 14, Cummins 8) Bumrah comes wide on the crease to angle in a couple of bumpers at Cummins, then lands one on a perfect length to draw an edge that doesn’t carry to the diving KL Rahul in the gully. 90th over: Australia 347-6 (Carey 14, Cummins 7) Australia continue to accumulate, but Akash shows the potential of the new ball on this deck by ripping a jaffa that is too good for Carey. Carey responds by coming down the pitch, eliminating any sideways movement, and belting a drive through long-off for four. There are 22 overs still scheduled to be bowled today with just 25 minutes remaining, so we’ll have to take that extra half-hour, taking us through to 5:50pm local time (6:50pm AEDT). With cloud cover starting to form again, and the floodlights taking effect, there’s a chance Australia might look to declare before the close and invite India to bat in these gloomy conditions. 89th over: Australia 340-6 (Carey 8, Cummins 6) Carey’s demeanour since striding out to the middle suggests Australia’s strategic approach is to keep this game moving quickly. He flays a boundary through the covers off a perfectly serviceable Bumrah delivery, then Cummins adds four more from a rare leg-stump half-volley. Given the prospect of inclement weather during the remainder of the Test, and the strength of the home attack, a first-innings total of 340+ may already be considered a match-winning one. 88th over: Australia 330-6 (Carey 3, Cummins 1) Australia’s No 7 &amp; 8 exchange singles before Carey is beaten on his outside edge by Akash from around the wicket. The strike rotates and Cummins plays and misses an attempted cut. Suddenly the pressure is back on Australia with no set batter at the crease and India with a ball just eight overs old. 87th over: Australia 327-6 (Carey 1, Cummins 0) Bumrah rips the final delivery from a double-wicket over past Cummins’ outside edge. Three wickets in the past 20 minutes and Bumrah has single-handedly turned this procession back into a contest. Carey’s beaten first up before realising the safe space is the non-striker’s end. His dab into the off side is fielded by Siraj who pulls up with cramp in the act of gathering the stroke. Then Bumrah gets his fifth! Again it’s a length delivery angled in (this time from around the wicket) that holds its line and draws the edge. Superb bowling from India’s one-man attack. It brings to an end a Test-defining knock from Travis Head. 152 quickfire runs that have put his side in the box seat. Brilliant batting. Bumrah with the new ball is threatening to bowl India back into this contest! Textbook delivery, angling in from over the wicket, holding its line, drawing the edge, and carrying comfortably to second slip. Marsh looked skittish during his 16 ball stay and his demise is little surprise. 86th over: Australia 325-4 (Head 151, Marsh 5) Akash cramps Head from around the wicket but he still scampers through for a single to bring up another milestone. The South Australian is dominating this series. Then Marsh is almost caught and bowled! A length delivery sticks in the wicket but Marsh follows through with the stroke anyway and bunts at catchable height towards the bowler in his follow through. Akash sticks out a right hand instinctively but it misses its target by a few inches and Australia’s No 6 gets off the mark. Marsh soon gets another life! Top-edging a pull down to backward square leg but it lands just in front of Gill coming in off the rope. After cruising for most of the day Australia are going through a little wayward patch. 85th over: Australia 318-4 (Head 149, Marsh 0) Marsh remains on none, and again misses out on an attempted pull as Bumrah sends down a rare maiden. 84th over: Australia 318-4 (Head 149, Marsh 0) Towards the end of a day dominated by Smith’s footwork, that was a tired, leaden-footed swipe at a full delivery, more reminiscent of recent struggles than the free-flowing batting of the previous couple of hours. Head gets Marsh on strike with a single, then the allrounder fails to get off the mark, missing a loose Akash delivery down the leg side. A single off the last is then adjudged a leg-bye. Big final hour coming up for India. Following the final drinks break of the day Australia work three singles off a Bumrah over that looks pedestrian, until he comes from widen on the crease and draws Smith into a drive that flies to the right of the tumbling Rohit at first slip who holds on this time to take an excellent catch. Smith walks off with 101 to his name and the satisfaction of playing himself back into form. That was an innings full of resilience and it’s put Australia in the box seat in this Test. 82nd over: Australia 313-3 (Smith 100, Head 146) Akash shares new ball duties but after a sighter Smith on-drives with technical precision to move to 99. Then he nudges off his pads for his 33rd Test century, and first in 26 innings. He had to really battle through his first 50 or so runs, but since then he’s been towed along in Travis Head’s slipstream, looking increasingly fluent and back to something like his old self. Meanwhile, Head continues on his merry way, getting a thick outside edge that beats gully and races away for four. 81st over: Australia 302-3 (Smith 95, Head 140) The new ball is taken immediately and gifted straight to Jasprit Bumrah. Can the Indian talisman drag his team back into the contest? He has two slips and a gully to Head.. who whips a half-volley off his toes over midwicket for an undemanding boundary. The second ball keeps low after pitching, not the first to that in the past hour or so, which will delight Australia’s pacemen with 300 runs already to defend. Ball three is full and wide and Head appears to dig out a bump-ball drive that is claimed spectacularly by a diving Jaiswal in the gully, who hurls the ball into the air thinking (perhaps) there’s a catch. The third umpire takes little time confirming the ball was hit into the deck off the bat. Bumrah sees the over out neatly, but there was little to excite him about the new Kookaburra. 80th over: Australia 297-3 (Smith 95, Head 135) Siraj draws an edge from Smith… but the old ball kept low off the pitch, then off the bat, and doesn’t threaten to carry to first slip. Decent over from Siraj, no boundaries from it, and out comes the second new ball. 79th over: Australia 295-3 (Smith 94, Head 134) Six balls, five singles. Rohit is just hanging Jadeja out to dry. One over of punishment before India can take the new ball. 78th over: Australia 291-3 (Smith 92, Head 132) Siraj bowls ok, Australia accumulate for five balls, then on the last Head just stands and delivers on the rise from off stump back down the ground for an intimidating boundary. That was brutish. 77th over: Australia 282-3 (Smith 90, Head 125) Rohit could also have hooked Jaedja from the attack but he’s out of options with the new ball so close. Smith takes advantage, freeing his arms through the off side and flaying a boundary through square cover. Can Smith reach triple figures before the new ball? 76th over: Australia 277-3 (Smith 86, Head 124) Rohit is forced to remove Nitish from the attack and call on Siraj, who immediately beats Head for pace as he tries to cut a delivery that lacked width. Just one run from a much tidier over. Meanwhile in Hamilton, play has ended on day two of the third Test with New Zealand well on course for a consolation victory over England. 75th over: Australia 276-3 (Smith 86, Head 123) Now Smith drills Jadeja through extra cover, and with the kind of insouciance we haven’t seen for a while, barely acknowledging the stroke as it races to the fence. It’s a shot that brings up the 200 partnership between this pair, one that began as a rebuilding job, became a platform, and is now a Test-defining combination that India have no answer to. 74th over: Australia 269-3 (Smith 81, Head 121) Nitish’s pace is dropping and Smith is starting to go through the gears, latching onto a wide delivery he’s been accustomed to leaving, then flowing his hands through an extra-cover drive that’s all timing. I think we can safely say he’s played himself back into form. Whether it’s consistent run-scoring form remains to be seen, but it’s a knock that removes any doubts over his place in this XI for the remainder of the summer. 73rd over: Australia 261-3 (Smith 74, Head 120) This pair are making life difficult for India. Rohit wants to sit on Jadeja from one end until the new ball but Head carves him through the covers for four, then Smith lofts him one bounce into the sightscreen for four more. Never mind the new ball, Australia may have already taken the Test away from India before it arrives. 72nd over: Australia 251-3 (Smith 69, Head 115) Nitish shares duties after tea but his first ball is overpitched and Head punches it with the full face of the bat straight back where it came from for a boundary of effortless simplicity. Then he’s dropped! Head tries to work Nitish off the stumps to leg and gets a leading edge that carries to a diving Rohit at second-ish slip, but tumbling away to his left the skipper can’t hold onto the chance despite getting two hands to the ball. Smith completes the over with a free swish of the blade, scything through the shot like a swashbuckler in an Errol Flynn movie for another confidence-boosting boundary. 71st over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 65, Head 106) Jadjea begins after Tea, and he almost jags the big wicket of Head with the centurion going too hard at a cut that wasn’t on after the ball spun into him off a length. He’s lucky to see his inside-edge run down to fine-leg instead of crashing into his pegs. There’s still the slight possibly of a shower before the day is out, but that chance is becoming more remote every passing minute. We should be in for ten or so overs of Australia making hay before what is likely to prove a Test-defining 90 minutes with the second new ball. 70th over: Australia 234-3 (Smith 65, Head 103) Australia complete the session without losing a wicket. They have motored from 75-3 to 234-3, turning this Test on its head. Travis Head has been the catalyst, but Steve Smith is grinding his way back into form at the other end. India’s bowlers haven’t done too much wrong, but they lack anything resembling a plan to Head, and Rohit has been slow to respond to this partnership following a nip-and-tuck opening couple of hours. 69th over: Australia 231-3 (Smith 64, Head 101) Smith nurdles Bumrah away for a single to bring Head on strike. The crowd gets involved, clapping Bumrah through his approach and “ooohing” as Head’s mistimed cover drive fails to beat the field. The claps return the following ball, and this time they are capped by raucous cheers as Australia’s star man clips three runs off his toes to bring up an effortless and rapid century. Another game-changing knock from the South Australian. He is in the form of his life, and the timing couldn’t be better as colleagues struggle around him. 68th over: Australia 227-3 (Smith 63, Head 98) Short and wide from Nitish and Smith unfurls that heavy-handed cut that comes down like an executioner’s axe, pounding the ball to the cover fence. Nice comeback from the allrounder though who almost pierces Smith’s defence with a yorker, then follows that up with some extra bounce off a length. A single off the last comes much to the frustration of the Gabba crowd who are ready to salute Head’s inevitable ton. 67th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 58, Head 98) Rohit breaks the glass in case of emergency and calls on Jasprit Bumrah to bowl his 18th over of the innings. Head couldn’t care less, bullying his second delivery off a length for four through mid-on. Then Smith plays one of those extra-cover drives where his feet are in position seemingly before the ball has been bowled and his bat looks about three blades wide. It only earns three on the slow outfield but it’s an ominous sign nonetheless. Prepare to stand and applaud another Head century sooner rather than later. 66th over: Australia 214-3 (Smith 55, Head 93) Nitish replaces Siraj and Head welcomes him to the attack by crunching a long hop in front of point for yet another boundary. Now Smith gets in on the act, pulling with vintage timing well in front of square. Is he back? 65th over: Australia 205-3 (Smith 51, Head 88) More runs for Travis Head, rocking back and carving Jadeja through the covers for four, then watching the ball onto the bat for a late cut worth two. Australia are putting their foot on the gas and India seem unable to respond. 64th over: Australia 196-3 (Smith 50, Head 80) Whenever Siraj drops short to Head the Australian goes on the attack. The latest example is an uppercut for four down to third from a delivery on off stump that would have cramped a batter in poorer form. India need Rohit to get a hold of this situation and start setting the narrative, whether it’s a short-ball approach to Head, bowling dry to Smith, or rotating his attack. At the moment Australia are taking control of this Test reasonably unopposed. 63rd over: Australia 191-3 (Smith 50, Head 75) Head slaps Jadeja through the covers for a long three after a smidgen of extra bounce forces a rare false stroke. Smith then nudges a single to mid-on to bring up a 42nd half-century, and surely one of his most hardworking and determined. Australia are now scoring at five rpo through the past dozen or so overs, taking the initiative away from India. 62nd over: Australia 184-3 (Smith 49, Head 71) Head continues to play a different game to the rest of his countrymen, swatting a pull from just in front of the badge on his helmet behind square for four. That was a decent bouncer from Siraj and his frenemy treated it with disdain. Another boundary follows soon afterwards, but far less convincingly, with a mighty slash outside off stump flying through the undermanned cordon. That’s the hundred partnership, and Head is bringing Smith along in his slipstream. 61st over: Australia 173-3 (Smith 48, Head 61) Three singles from another rapid Jadeja over. This partnership is now 98, and with Head in full control of his game. India have a big 19 overs coming up before the second new ball is due. 60th over: Australia 170-3 (Smith 47, Head 59) Head effortlessly ramps Siraj for a one-bounce four, much to the annoyance of Simon Katich who is furious the man who has been fielding at a fly-slip/third is no longer in position. Of course Rohit then returns a fielder to that posting immediately afterwards. On the subject of recently retired TV commentators… This tweet is an astute observation and a pattern we’ve seen repeated throughout the past 20-30 years. Right now we have David Warner in his early commentary career sweet spot on FOX, along with Aaron Finch doing his best to add value on the mic on Seven. The challenge for broadcasters is extending these windows for as long as possible (see Ricky Ponting) to avoid the expert analysis either losing currency as the game changes around them, or the cricketer segues into a broadcaster and stops making the effort as they become too comfortable with the sound of their own voice (see most of the rest). At least with two options here in Australia I can flick between call teams when, say, Brett Lee thinks his job is to be funny, or James Brayshaw calls Steve Smith “Smudge” like he’s a footy player kicking a goal on FM radio. 59th over: Australia 163-3 (Smith 46, Head 53) Jadeja again does his best to improve the over-rate, conceding just a single for his troubles. The partnership is now up to 88. I’m going to steal a nugget from cricket writer Daniel Cherny who has just tweeted “ Steve Smith batting average in Test cricket in 2024: At the Gabba: 143 / Everywhere else: 15.” 58th over: Australia 162-3 (Smith 46, Head 52) Smith continues to sidestep a long way across his stumps and earns a couple of leg-byes down to fine leg. Then he doesn’t move as far and is fortunate to squirt a leading edge through the vacant point region for a couple more. He is really grinding out there, but he keeps Siraj wicketless and moves closer to a half-century. 57th over: Australia 158-3 (Smith 44, Head 52) Jadeja hurries through a maiden, keeping Head watchful on the crease. Thank you Angus, and hello to everybody else out there. After two quickfire Tests that moved at breakneck speed, we’re now halfway through an engrossing day of more traditional high-quality fare. India’s four seamers have given little away, and only Travis Head has looked to take the game on with the bat. Steve Smith’s innings has been fascinating, watching him return to that bold trigger movement to the off side and survive a number of near misses on both edges and marginal LBWs. It’s been dry for most of the day despite heavy showers drifting inland across south east Queensland from the Pacific. There remains a chance one or more of those may clip the Gabba before the close of play. And that close is scheduled to be 5.20pm local time (6.20pm AEDT) with an unlikely 56 overs scheduled to be bowled in the next three or so hours. Please send me your emails and keep me company. The address is jonathan.howcroft.casual@guardian.co.uk. 56th over: Australia 158-3 (Smith 44, Head 52) Five from the over as Head takes another a pair of runs and a single and Smith takes an aerial route to another two from the bowling of Siraj. That brings this partnership to 83 – much-needed by Australia. That’s me done for the day! Thanks for your company and emails. I pass the baton to Jonathan Howcroft who’ll take you home to stumps. Siraj is back but Head is merciless. He takes the bowler’s short ball at 135kph and pulls hard in front of square for two to bring up his third 50-plus score in a row. Great batting by Head. He is hauling this Test match back into Australia’s favour. 55th over: Australia 153-3 (Smith 42, Head 49) Was that a snick?! Jadeja wangled his field, bringing in a silly mid-on with great fanfare. Head went to drive and missed. Big appeal from thw bowler but Rohit Sharma, with just one referral left, demurs. Good call – that noise was bat hitting pad. The next noise is Head whacking Jadeja over the top for FOUR down the ground. Wide again goes Jadeja? Down the ground again goes Head! Suddenly, with conbsecutive boundaries, Head is within sight of a half-century. 54th over: Australia 143-3 (Smith 42, Head 40) Akash Kumar Reddy is into his 18th over – the most for India in this innings. He has 0-39 with five maidens to show for it but has straightened his lines since the first session to make the batters play more often. And play Smith does! Akash put that one wider and Smith got onto his toes to cut for FOUR! 53rd over: Australia 139-3 (Smith 38, Head 39) Ravindra Jadeja bustles through another lightning-fast over, with just a single to Travis Head and a no-ball to show for it. The allrounder is in his 78th Test and averages over 35 with the bat and 23 with the ball with 3235 Test runs and 319 wickets. Yet he’s been left out of the side for this series until now! 52nd over: Australia 137-3 (Smith 38, Head 37) After Head’s single, Akash zeroes in on Smith’s leg stump. But Smudge is onto it and whips it quickly through midwicket for three runs. Head hammers square but can’t breach the field. It’s just a single and brings him level with Smith on 38. Akash beats Smith with the fifth and the batter bows his head to show he’s been bested. 51st over: Australia 132-3 (Smith 35, Head 36) Jadeja is a spin bowler who bowls quickly, hustling in and cranking out his deliveries like a dervish. Six balls disappear in a flash with just a leg bye leaked. 50th over: Australia 131-3 (Smith 35, Head 36) Smith drives down the ground for FOUR. It was a ripe half volley from Akash, who looks to be tiring in his 16th over, and Smith took full advantage, uncoiling a magnificent shot to send the ball to the rope. Great response from the bowler as he whips one, then a second, past the outside edge. We have an appeal… no raised finger… and no referral. Rightly so, as replays show that noise was ball hitting hip en route to the ‘keeper. Akash rips the next one past Smith’s batr and into his left pad and appeals afresh for LBW. Rohit refers it… and rues it. Replays show it flying over the top of leg stump. 49th over: Australia 127-3 (Smith 31, Head 36) Interesting change for India. Coming into bowl the 49th over is Ravi Jadeja, the world’s best allrounder in his first game of the series. And straight away he finds turn from this Gabba green top, getting one to fizz and stay low on Head. He’s up to the oddity though. And now he punishes extra bounce by pulling Jadeja around the corner for a muscular FOUR. Six from the over and the Smith-Head partnership has hit FIFTY. Of those, Steve Smith has contributed just 13. 48th over: Australia 121-3 (Smith 31, Head 30) Head ramps Bumrah for FOUR! What a shot. The Indian master dug the ball in short at 138kph and the Australian No 5 calmly leaned back, took it off his moustache and lifted it over the slip cordon for the craftiest of boundaries. Shot! Over in Hamilton, England have collapsed to be all out 143! Rather than enforce the follow-on New Zealand are batting again with the buffer of a 204-run lead. 47th over: Australia 116-3 (Smith 31, Head 25) As Akash toils into his 15th over and the mercury nudges 30C in Brisbane, the Smith-Head partnership hits 40 runs, the best of the Australian innings so far. There is a beach ball doing the rounds of the outer and Smith is momentarily distracted, too much to score anything off the bat. 46th over: Australia 115-3 (Smith 31, Head 25) Bumrah’s 16th over is sharp and nasty and Australia take two singles, with neither batter eager to retain strike. Fascinating sessions ahead – will Head rip the Test from India’s grasp as he did in Adelaide? Or will Bumrah blast out the home side as he did so potently in Perth? 45th over: Australia 113-3 (Smith 30, Head 24) Akash is into his 13th over and has 0-25 so far. His first ball is a fast yorker and Head whips it off his toes for two. He looks in good touch does the Australian vice-captain. Indian enforcer Mohammed Siraj is back on the field after his dicky hamstring came good. He chases it down and gets his customary jeer from the outer. Heads cuts the second ball for a single. Smith shuffles into a straight ball and draws an appeal from Akash. But there’s no support from his teammates let alone the umpire. 44th over: Australia 110-3 (Smith 30, Head 21) Swish and a miss! Smith left the first one, chased the second. Bumrah drew him forward and Smith stepped out late and missed. Now an inside edge narrowly misses the timberwork and runs away to fine leg for FOUR. Rueful smiles from both batter and bowler but danger signs for Australia. Bumrah has a full belly and an appetite for destruction. A single to Smith gets him to 30 and brings Head on strike. Bumrah switches to around the wicket and angles it in on a leg stump line. Head steps out and meets it, driving for an easy single to keep strike. Players are back on the field and action is about to get under way. It will be Jasprit Bumrah to Steve Smith… What a terrific session that was – rain-free and action-packed! Under blue Brisbane skies, India won the early battle thanks again to their fast-bowling maestro Jasprit Bumrah (2-26 from 14 overs). He dismissed both Australia’s opening pair of Usman Khawaja (21 from 54) and Nathan McSweeney (nine from 49) in a brilliant spell of controlled yet aggressive bowling in the morning session. Australia rallied for a time with a 37-run partnership between the twitch twins of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. Then, in the 33rd over, Nitish Kumar Reddy wrestled back the momentum for the visitors, drawing Marnus forward and catching the edge for Virat Kohly to pouch his second catch of the day. It put Australia on the brink at 75-3. Smith lived dangerously with his hot-stepping from leg stump to off and was lucky to survive several close appeals. But he endured, and has battled his way to lunch unbeaten on 25 with just a solitary boundary from his 68 balls faced. Travis Head has typically added rocket fuel to the innings, charging to 20 from 35 balls with two boundaries. His battle against Bumrah in this next session may yet define the Test – and the series. Time to wet the whistle and bolster the belly. Back soon! 43rd over: Australia 104-3 (Smith 25, Head 20) Travis Head doesn’t believe in blocking his way to a break. First ball from Akash he attacks and drives for two runs to deep cover. Then a single to take his total to 20 from 32 and this partnership to 26 at a strike-rate of 50. Smith taps another one onto his tally. Head again has a heave at Akash but misses. His drives at the fifth but Bumrah cuts it off with a dive. In good news for India, Mohammed Siraj is back on the field seemingly recovered from his hamstring twinge. That will be lunch. 42nd over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 24, Head 17) After Smith pushes Bumrah through square leg for a single, Australia’s hundred comes up from a Head push backward of square. One more over before we break for a feed I reckon. 41st over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 23, Head 16) Travis Head isn’t playing for lunch – he’s ever-hungry for runs. Two balls in succession he’s tried to slash Akash over gully and failed. Now he flashes again and Pant has to really jump to haul it down. A very eventful maiden! 40th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 23, Head 16) Smith v Bumrah isn’t quite Godzilla v Kong although “Smudge” isn’t a bad moniker for a metropolis-marauding behemoth. Not in this over though. After Head’s sharp single from Bumrah’s front-foot no-ball, Smith plays out three dots. 39th over: Australia 95-3 (Smith 23, Head 15) Just a single for Head as he cuts backward of square. Nitish keeps it tight for the remainder of the over as Smith looks to lunch. 38th over: Australia 94-3 (Smith 23, Head 14) Finally, we have the monster match this crowd has been waiting for: Head v Bumrah. Head takes a single from the first, Smith does likewise. And now… WHACK! Head gets onto the front foot and drives with pinpoint accuracy between mid off and cover for FOUR. Lovely shot. He tries to replicate it on the next but doesn’t middle it. Instead it’s a sand iron chipped over the infield for three. Suddenly, Travis Head has 14 from 16 balls and is officially away! 37th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 22, Head 6) As Siraj continues and Bumrah remains ominously on ice, Australia take two backward of point. Tully Haines has been in touch by email after a fielding mishap resulted in what Tully believes is a fatal twist of fate for Marnus: Hi Angus, I was very worried Labuschagne would get out that ball, Smith’s shot for three clearly touched Bumrah’s trousers while his arm was on the ground over the rope. Should have been a four and Smith should have stayed on strike. Meanwhile, Ross McGillivray joins the chorus of critics who loathe Labuschagne’s slow-motion walk off after being dismissed… Marnus strolls off as slow as can be practising the shot he thinks he played that hit him out. He’s a bit of a worry. Agree, Ross. Not a good look by Marnus. But it’s been going on for some time now hasn’t it? Would you consider it dissent? And whose job is it to call him on it? India have another worry. Mohammed Siraj has gone off with an injury. 36th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 20, Head 6) Head… SHOT! Nitish gave him width and Travis whacked him to the boundary with a square cut that disappeared in a flash. Head tries it again but this time it’s stopped by the infielder. He gets a single from the next instead but this Test has started to accelerate now Australia’s wrecking ball No 5 is at the crease. There’s a mild appeal as Head’s pull shot misses by a millimetre. Nothing doing. 35th over: Australia 77-3 (Smith 19, Head 1) Mohammed Siraj is back for a tenth over but surely Jasprit Bumrah will return next over to take on Head before he gets going. But not yet. First we have a huge shout for LBW against Smith – no appeal mind you, as Siraj continues his annoying habit of charging to his slip cordon rather than asking the question of the umpire. Umpire says NO but it’s a no-shot by Smith and an ugly one. He stepped across and got hit hard and high on the right pad. Siraj was certain he had the wicket but the umpire shook his head. Sharma referred it… but no dice. Although it’s clipping the off bail, we will stay with the infield decision. Now we have more controversy as Siraj loses the towel tucked into his waistband in his delivery stride. Smith plays a shot while pointing out the anomaly and somehow manages a run. Head finds a single off the last to finish a weird over. 34th over: Australia 75-3 (Smith 15, Head 0) After that wicket, Travis Head walks to the wicket on a run of three golden ducks in a row at the Gabba! He survives the first ball from Nitish, thankfully one of those legside deliveries that undid him in the past. Head’s hands are flashing as always, hungry for bat on ball. But he can’t get off the mark just yet. Good over by Nitish. Farewell, Marnus Labuschagne! Nitish has really bent his back and bowled beautifully this morning and now he has his reward. That was a faster ball angled across the batter and Labuschagne went to drive with hard hands and misjudged the pace to send a thick edge straight into the sticky fingers of Virat Kohli at second slip. Australia three down and India on top! 33rd over: Australia 72-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 15) A middlin’ shout by Siraj against Smith is dismissed by both umpire and India captain Rohit Sharma. They run a legbye instead. A strange moment now as Siraj walks down the pitch and switches the bails, a piece of gamesmanship straight out of the Stuart Broad Playbook! Labuschagne’s riposte is to wait until the bowler turns his back before switching the bails back. Now Siraj, steam issuing from the ears, puts one around Marnus’s ears and follows it with some fruity lip service. Marnus gets one off the hip through midwicket and runs two. Cricket is a game full of strange superstitions… 32nd over: Australia 70-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 15) Nitish returns for a fourth over. Labuschangne is bogged down with just eight runs from 43 balls. Finally, runs! He moves his total on with a well-timed flick off the pads for two. Siraj fields on the boundary and the pantomime villain gets a chorus of jeers from the Gabba crowd. Labuschagne drives the next one, an over-pitched ball on middle, but Bumrah moves quickly to his left to stop what looked a certain boundary. Good fielding India. 31st over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 15) Another lovely shot by Smith from Siraj’s first ball. He adds two more with a controlled swipe through midwicket for two. The big beligerent quick retaliates by banging the next one in faster on leg stump and it’s very nearly LBW. Luckily, Smith gets a bit of blade on it. Good bowling! Smith was beaten by the pace there. and Siraj is starting to get the ball to skid on 30th over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 15) Bang! Smith drives Nitish handsomely for three runs. He has 15 and is starting to look good. 29th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) A curious over as Siraj and Labuschagne throw a flurry of blows at each other for no runs or reward on either side. Some handsome shots by the batter but can’t pierce the field. Some scorching deliveries by the bowler but no edge. Ultimately, it’s a very entertaining maiden. Siraj comments on this curious turn of events with a flash of his forked tongue at the end of the over. Labuschagne blows a bubble and smirks. Don’t poke the bear Marnus! 28th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) Australia are slowly rebuilding after the loss of their opening pair. This partnership is now worth 24 from 56 deliveries. Jasprit Bumrah is out of the attack and they have the second and third-change bowlers Siraj and Nitish coming at them. Can they cash in? Not in this over. Nitish, firing them down at 127kph, bowls a maiden. 27th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) Labuschagne finds a single from the first ball of Siraj’s sixth over. The big quick makes Smith play at the next two. Fourth ball is short – VERY short. It flies over the batter and wicketkeeper Pant and runs away for five wides. Smith salts the wound with a glanced single from the fifth. 26th over: Australia 55-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 9) Double change by India as Nitish Kumar Reddy enters the attack for his first over of the Test. He delivers a mixed bag in his first foray, probing outside off stump and that leg stump line Smith seemns vulbnerable to. Five dots until Smith works one out of his ribcage for a fast-run deuce. 25th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Jasprit Bumrah is grabbing a breather and captain Rohit Sharma has brought his firebrand fastbowler Mohammed Siraj into the attack. Right from the jump he gets Labuschagne hopping. Now he catches Marnus i9n front and not offering a shot. Huge shout! Umpires says NO. The India skipper says YeahbutNoReview. And it’s a good call – straight but flying over middle stump. Good bowling by Siraj, risky batting by Labuschagne. Drinks are on the field here at the Gabba and it’s 53-2. Over in Hamilton it’s 54-2. New Zealand may have lost the series against England but they are going down with a fight in this third and final Test. A flurry by the tailenders got them to a first innings total of 347 and they now have both openers out and England in trouble. 24th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Akash needs a spell. He’s releasing the pressure Bumrah builds with over after over of wider balls that are too easy for the batters to leave. Finally after four air balls, Smith drops and runs… and gets two leg byes. Awkward to watch as Smith thrust leg and bat at it, but it’s two more on the total. 23rd over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Another edge! This time it’s Labuschagne caught on the crease by Bumrah, squared up and snicking just short of second slip. Next delivery is a peach, sliding down the channel a whisker from the bat. Even Marnus claps his bat in appreciation of that one. Rightly so. Bumrah is on song. Somehow, after a couple more swishes, Labuschagne survives the over. 22nd over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Beaten! Labuschgnage chased Akash there and it very nearly resulted in his demise. Better bowling by the six-Test tyro from Delhi. But that’s wide and fiull again and Labuschagne punishes it, sending it just short of the midwicket boundary for three. And now more luck for Smith! He flinches and edges, sending it skidding through the slips cordon for a very tinny boundary. Fifty is up for Australia. 21st over: Australia 44-2 (Labuschagne 4, Smith 3) Bumrah to Smith. This will be quite the duel. Smith is caught on the hip by a ball angling in at 138kph. He pushes into the offside for tight run. Good strike rotation by these two so far. Smith started this 112th Test of his career needing 296 runs to reach the coveted 10,000 Test runs mark. He is four runs closer to that dream. As is Labuschagne, who scampers a single from the last. 20th over: Australia 42-2 (Labuschagne 3, Smith 2) Straight away Smith, who is batting way outside leg stump, is taking a big step back and across to negate the swing. His first ball from Akash is a straight-out play and miss as he’s beaten on the inside edge. Akash is aghast. Smith takes a run through midwicket from Akash’s third ball to get off his duck. Labuschagne takes a single and Smith does likewise to close out the over. 19th over: Australia 39-2 (Labuschagne 2, Smith 0) Steve Smith is at the crease and Jasprit Bumrah is on a tear with two wickets already this morning. His first ball is a trap – a legside lure that Smith chases. Risky! That’s what cooked his bacon in the last Test but he still goes for it. A leg bye ensues. Bumrah strikes again! McSweeney snicks off to Kohli at second slip and the visitors are suddenly on fire at the Gabba. Nine runs off 49 balls for the rookie opener in his third Test. Poor footwork and Bumrah angled it in and the edge was healthy and lethal. That won’t quiet the calls for NSW young gun Sam Konstas to get a shot as Australia’s opener. 18th over: Australia 38-1 (McSweeney 9, Labuschagne 2) Finally Akash makes McSweeney play… and he edges! But it’s low and wide of slip and scuds to the boundary rope. In one streaky stroke McSweeney just doubled the total it took him 44 balls to compile. Shackles sprung, he runs a single to celebrate. Labuschagne gets off the mark with a dodgy clip to fine leg, inside edging a straight one onto his pad and taking two. Akash had 0-3 from five overs but now has 0-10 from six. 17th over: Australia 31-1 (McSweeney 4, Labuschagne 0) Here comes Marnus. Can he pick up where he left off in the second Test? That strong knock led Australia to victory and saved a career which hung by a thread after two very ugly dismissals in the opening match. He gets behind the first few as Bumrah straight away attacks his pads. Khawaja goes! Beautiful bowling by Bumrah who banged it in at 137kph on a fourth-stump line and drew a feathered edge. India have first blood on day two and again the visitors have exposed Khawaja who has got himself into a fatal habit of jumping to meet the rising delivery. That one was full and angled and it caught Australia’s veteran opener indecisive with minimal footwork. He played… and lost. 16th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 21, McSweeney 4) It’s Akash’s birthday but Nathan McSweeney is getting all the gifts. Six dots in this over but not one of them made the batter play. India need wickets and McSweeney, already a formidable astonewaller, isn’t going to chance his hand if he doesn’t have to. 15th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 21, McSweeney 4) First runs! And it’s a handsome back foot swish through covers by Khawaja. Two runs. Bumrah was a tad short yesterday and he starts day two in the same vein. No sign of seam movement or swing so far. Bumrah squares up Khawaja on the next – good comeback by the master quick who starts his seventh over with 0-10. Big shout on the third as Khawaja misses a straight one but the edge was audible for mine. Maybe Jasprit was just warming up the tonsils. He finishes with a flourish, beating the batter with two zingers to close. Game on! 14th over: Australia 29-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) It’s Akash Deep’s birthday today and he gets a four-ball over first-up to celebrate. His first ball is… wide. So is his second. Two sighters for McSweeney – what a gift for a batter who’s starting the day with four runs from 33 deliveries and a strike-rate of 11. Fifth ball is a no ball. Last one is a leave. So ends an over that took 22 hours to complete. Here we go, folks…. buckle ‘em up and batten ‘em down! As players prepare to take the field under increasingly blue skies here at the Gabba, it’s nice to hear Melbourne’s own Hunters &amp; Collectors (street name: “Hunners”) providing the soundtrack for this summer’s thali feast of cricket… Brisbane isn’t the only city complicating Test cricket with the unpredictability of its weather patterns. England and New Zealand are fighting out the final Test of their series in scorching heat and high wind. Here’s how Ali Martin saw day one in Hamilton. With the series square at one-all and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy now down to a – weather permitting – three-Test shootout, both teams are eyeing the bonus prize of a spot in the World Test Championship, most likely against ladder-leaders South Africa. Yesterday’s rain gave us plenty of time to ponder the permutations if weather intervenes in this contest.As Martin Pegan sees it: India are the most at risk of paying a price if rain ruins this contest with the two-time WTC runner-up needing to win all three remaining Tests against Australia to guarantee qualification to another final. If Australia regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time since 2014-15, they would almost certainly return to the final after beating India in the 2023 decider. Australia could still qualify for the final if the series against India is drawn 2-2, with two Tests in Sri Lanka to play early next year. Our own Geoff Lemon had plenty of time on day one to mull over where both teams’ fortunes lie based on the flip of a coin… Good morning cricket fans and welcome to day two of the Guardian’s live coverage of this third Test between Australian and India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Angus Fontaine here for the first chunk of play (touch wood) before Jonathan Howcroft takes you through to stumps. First things first: it’s ISN’T raining at the Gabba. It’s cloudy and it’s windy. It’s hot and it’s humid. Hell, there are even some skinny streak of blue overhead. But there’s NO RAIN. So all things going well, play will resume an hour early today with action to get under way at 9.50am local time (10.50am AEST). The forecast for today is the best for the week ahead. Things aren’t looking so bright for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “Showers and thunderstorms are possible during the next few days, however no significant rainfall is expected,” the Bureau has told us. But let’s live for today and get ready for what umpires have deigned to be a minimum 98-overs of cricket. Rain condemned us to a measly 13.2 overs bowled by India on day one, all in the first session, as 81 millimetres was dumped on Brisbane in what meteorologists are dubbing a “rain bomb”. That torrent triggered flash-flooding across Queensland and sparked fears the city could be in for floods as catastrophic as the record-breaking deluges of 2022. But it didn’t dampen Australia’s spirits as they sought to cash in on India captain Rohit Sharma’s curious decision to win the toss and bowl on a Gabba ‘green top’. Despite the persistent showers, opening pair of Usman Khawaja (19 not out) and Nathan McSweeney (4 not out) kept their powder dry, compiling their highest opening partnership of the series and going to an early lunch safe and snug with the scoreboard at 28-0. From the little we saw, India’s bowlers were a touch short, allowing three-Test rookie McSweeney to hang tough again after his excellent 39 in the second Test, as he left Jasprit Bumrah judiciously and eked singles where he could. Meanwhile, his normally dour senior partner Khawaja showed impressive intent, leaning back and unfurling a couple of the lovely boundary strokes we’ve come to expect from him. Australia fans will be hoping for more of this on day two."

          "bodyText": "1. How do I know which pieces to wear on a night out? I’m all about balance when it comes to styling. I can’t bear the thought of looking overdone, or as if I’ve tried too hard. So when I dress to go out, I’ll wear a pair of statement earrings and either a cuff or a statement ring. On the rare occasion that I wear a necklace, I won’t wear earrings unless they are really small, so as not to distract. For me, there must be just one hero piece to set off an outfit. Alexis Foreman, art director and style curator, @alexisforeman 2. As you age, bigger earrings and hoops can weigh down your ear, giving a saggy appearance. Is there a way to avoid this? We believe that getting dressed and accessorising should be fun and freeing, and you should wear what makes you feel like “you” at any age. For a woman over 50, we recommend opting for an earring with more coverage on the ear, as well as larger earring backs, which offer support and can diminish sagging. A lightweight earring (which doesn’t necessarily mean a small earring!) can give the illusion of substance while still prioritising comfort. Eliza Higgins and Brinker Higgins, founders of Brinker + Eliza, @brinkerandeliza 3. How do I mix antique jewellery with modern pieces? Try starting with a hero piece: maybe a dazzling vintage brooch or a chunky gold bracelet, something that makes a statement. Then, pair it with clean, contemporary designs – think sleek rings or a modern watch. The key is contrast: vintage pieces have a rich look, so balancing them with smooth, minimal, contemporary designs creates harmony. Don’t overthink it! Layering modern and vintage is about visual balance. Jewellery doesn’t just accessorise; it complements and elevates your entire look. So don’t hesitate to mix and match. Susan Caplan, renowned curator of vintage jewellery, @susancaplan 4. How can I achieve the quiet luxury look without spending a fortune? Is it just a case of wearing gold? There is some excellent high-street and mid-priced designer jewellery that won’t break the bank. The key is to stick with gold. Nothing oozes luxury like the sheen of molten gold. However, forget demure, barely there pieces; this season it’s all about statement sculptural accessories. Bottega’s teardrop earrings, coiled bracelets and sculpted rings started the trend. The key is to make the singular piece do the talking. Whether it’s Tilly Sveaas’s signature T-bar on a chunky chain (Taylor Swift is a big fan), &amp; Other Stories’ sculptural wrap necklace or Otiumberg’s oval hoops, plain or with discreet Pavé, the importance is to let that one piece do all the talking. Deborah Brett, fashion editor and designer, @deborahbrett 5. Is there a new twist on the curated ear? Yes, the twist is that needing piercings to create a stacked look is gone. Our ear-cuff category is one of our bestselling, and we’ve seen all age groups buy into our sculptural cuffs, which layer up the ear effortlessly and comfortably. The layering of cuffs gives a bold, stacked and sophisticated look with absolutely no piercing required. Rosanna Wollenberg, co-founder of Otiumberg, @otiumberg 6. Are there rules for matching bracelets with necklaces, earrings and rings? There are a few unwritten rules to tie everything together. I suggest sticking to one metal tone with similar motifs and surface finishing. For example, I’d pair an organically shaped bracelet with a different style of organic-looking chain necklaces, rounded earrings and rings in similar metal tones to create an interesting harmony. Yoon, founder of Tokyo-based jewellery website Ambush, @yoon_ambush 7. Are there any tips for wearing different-coloured jewellery, or what shade I should choose? I like something that brings out your eye colour. Wear stones that enhance the colour of the outfit or clash with it – there is something fun about juxtaposing colours. I like to serve up the unexpected, rather than the obvious matchy-matchy. Ultimately, the stone colour just needs to speak to you. You need to feel great in it. Marisa Horden, founder and creative director of Missoma 8. Is it time to re-think the necklace stack and move on to a new look? There is absolutely no need to ditch the necklace stack if it works for you. Let your necklace choices be an expression of you. That might mean wearing three chains, with or without pendants, of increasing length and size; or stacking two big, bold statement necklaces in the same shape, but made from different metals; this runs counter to the prescribed notion of wearing different sizes. Just have fun. Think, what makes me feel good here? That’s a very modern way of doing jewellery. Kenya Hunt, editor-in-chief, Elle UK 9. What’s the best way to achieve an instant style update? Boho has been the big-hitter for the last few seasons: Chloé’s necklaces decorated with playful charms and pendants, to shells and creature motifs. This trend continues, but with a new twist and one that you can adopt – and even try a little DIY. Hammered silver and hand-cast pendants were spotted suspended from satin ribbons and shaggy strands of yarn at Dries van Noten. A trick you can use to adapt or transform your charms and pendants is to add a vibrant, corded ribbon or narrow upholstery cord to replace the chain, and fasten with a neat bow. Voilà! An instant update to your jewellery box, and easily changeable to work with any look. Beaded and glass-blown flowers as necklaces were used as finishing details at Bottega Veneta and Alberta Ferretti (Etsy has a great selection). Saint Laurent opted for pure opulence with statement cuffs, worn stacked or over sleeves. The Flowy Bangle from edblad.com (£95) and Wolf and Badger’s Abstract Gold Statement Cuff Bracelet (£60), elevate a blouse to runway status instantly. A Solange ring (hotlipsbysolange.co.uk, £215) in black cherry or bubble gum pink will give you an instant pop of colour and joy. Harriet Green, the Observer Magazine editor 10. Is it OK to re-design your engagement ring after you’ve worn it for years? Yes, it’s perfectly OK to go for a redesign. What I love about jewellery is that it carries memory; the stones have sentimental value. You don’t lose that when you reshape an old engagement ring into a new piece, or add new stones to it, or place it in a new setting or design. They carry the story of the moment and the engagement; it is still the same material. Some people like to add birthstones to represent the birth of their children, or add stones from a parent’s jewellery. The transformation of your original engagement ring can be a talking piece, and you can include your partner in that. Ruth Tomlinson, jeweller, @ruthtomlinsonjewellery 11. Five of the best affordable jewellers that should be on my radar? My most complimented piece is the sparkly Christy ring from Daphine (£120), which I’ve had for four years and has yet to change shade – my best investment in terms of cost-per-wear. For similar at half the price, head to Orelia where prices start from £18. Whether you’re a chunky earring fan or your ears are peppered with delicate piercings, Seol &amp; Gold is the place for interesting designs you can humblebrag about, with earrings starting at £6.40. If you’re on a budget but want your jewellery to look and feel expensive, turn your attention to the growing tarnish-free category. By Rae and Hey Harper are the waterproof brands to note, with pieces that look steeper than their price tags suggest. I swear by the latter, which operates on a the-more-you-buy-the-bigger-the-discount basis – dangerous territory if you’re a magpie like me. Krissy Turner, fashion and beauty director at Eliza, @misskrissyturner 12. How can I wear chunky necklaces without looking like an MP? One way is to avoid wearing a chunky necklace with that stiff, formal day-dress, officewear look. Instead, wear a big necklace and dress it down. Underneath an open shirt, on top of bare skin. Or on top of a jumper, with jeans. The high-low mix is always a good one. Nice to wear with an evening dress or tux, too. Solange Azagury-Partridge, jewellery designer @solangeazagury 13. My husband recently bought me a necklace for my birthday that I just don’t like. What’s the best jewellery etiquette that doesn’t hurt his feelings? I’d would wholeheartedly say honesty is the best policy. Otherwise, you’ll find him repeatedly buying you gifts you don’t like. Regardless of the fact you don’t like the necklace, it’s important to express genuine thanks for the thought and effort put into it. As far as etiquette goes, a thoughtful gift-giver should include a gift receipt. Include him when you return or swap the necklace, show him what you like and the pieces you don’t, and explain why. I suggest taking a leaf from another expert, Sophia Neophitou, and curate a selection of pieces you like and let your husband choose what he wishes to buy you. Jo Jones, fashion editor, the Observer Magazine 14. Is it possible to wear a pearl necklace without looking like an 80s Sloane Ranger? Pearls and pearl jewellery are having a huge renaissance. They are no longer consigned to the archival looks of neat rows of pearls and chokers as worn by the late Diana, Princess of Wales. For me, pearls have become an everyday style staple and I love wearing and styling them for any occasion – workwear, formal and party looks and, most importantly, with a really casual outfit. And that’s my top tip: switch up your thinking and preconceptions of a pearl and throw them on with your most casual and effortless look: jeans and T-shirt or roundneck knit. Also layer, layer, layer to give your pearls a modern style refresh. Layer with chunkier or more delicate chains in gold and silver to create textural layers and add an edge, or even style with diamonds to add an extra dose of glam and lustre to your outfit. Drape your pearls, add different sizes and hues for a nod to 90s Chanel but decidedly 2024. There are some great finds on the high street: contemporary pearl jewellery that is much more organic, creative and architectural looking, from a freshwater pearl necklace at Cos for £65 to great Zara necklaces from £19.99. Emily Fitch Miller, fashion and creative art director, @emilyfitchm 15. Where’s a good place to buy an ethical, entry-level diamond ring? There’s a lot of greenwashing in jewellery around recycled metals and lab-grown stones, so choose carefully. Most independent jewellers will be able to tell you the origin of their materials and the design will be more special. Lylie jewellery, specialising in ethical sourcing, offers a comparison guide online for mined, lab-grown and vintage diamonds. You can also send in your unworn jewellery and receive a credit voucher towards a new piece. Antique diamonds are another ethical way to shop, either through a jeweller or at auction. Consider coloured gemstones like tourmaline, aquamarine and white topaz as a more affordable alternative to diamonds as the price per carat is lower. There are a lot of jewellers specialising in this. Gee Woods is a good example, as she sources beautiful gems and sets them in more fashion-forward settings, and each is one of a kind. Fentonand.co offers an online build-your-own ring service; choose your stone, cut, metal, setting, etc, and the pricing is very transparent, so you don’t have to ask awkward questions about costs. Sarah Royce-Greensill, freelance jewellery editor, writer and consultant 16. Should I save my cocktail ring for special occasions and nights out? Wear them anytime! No cocktail ring is too much for everyday. Putting jewellery on in the morning is part of your armour and, unlike a black silk party dress, you can wear a cocktail ring to the office – it’s not just for parties. I have a favourite 1940s one that’s like a gold walnut whip with a diamond that I wore every day for years. You might not be someone with a pink leopard coat, but jewellery is a way of expressing yourself in a less intense way. Think of it as a mini rebellion, particularly if you have to wear a uniform or clothing to work that doesn’t feel like you. Bear Brooksbank, jeweller 17. Is there a trick to mixing metals, and how many can you wear at one time? Mixing metals is a really good way to create a fun layered look. I particularly love stacking rings and bangles. I like wearing silver and gold on the same finger. I love adding a diamond pavé bangle in silver to a stack of gold cuffs and bangles. It’s a way of making diamonds look more casual, but it still looks curated. But I would encourage everyone to play with stacks: there are no rules and lots of lovely combinations when you play with scale, alternating textures and finishes. And it’s fine to mix gold, rose gold and silver, too. The trick is to let one area shine. If your wrists are stacked with tri-metal bangles, keep your earrings simple or skip a necklace altogether. Here are my top three tips: 1) Create a hero piece and build around it; 2) Keep styles cohesive: whether minimalist or bold, stick to a theme across your jewellery; 3) Layer textures – a smooth gold bangle paired with a hammered-silver cuff adds depth and dimension. Monica Vinader CEO and founder of Monica Vinader jewellery 18. What are the top tips for buying vintage jewellery? My go-to vintage stores for fine jewellery are Liberty, where prices start at £250 for pearl earrings, and Grays Antique Market in London. The market is full of independent stallholders and stocks an amazing selection of vintage and new pieces. For unique heirloom fine jewellery that I will pass down through my family, I go to Pennisi in Milan. There are so many pieces online, but I’m the sort who likes to see things in person and know what I’m buying. The brilliant thing about antiques markets versus department stores is that you can haggle; expect to negotiate up to 20% off. I love Annina Vogel, who takes vintage pieces and mounts them in a modern way. For Christmas or birthdays, my husband likes to buy for me, but my taste is very specific, so I will shortlist three items from a favourite boutique, and he will choose one from that. It works beautifully because I get what I want, but it’s still a surprise. Sophia Neophitou, global editor-in-chief, 10 Magazine and 10 Men 19. How would you go about building a charm bracelet? Charm bracelets make excellent gifts, especially for an 18th or 21st birthday. I love a curated collection of charms acquired over time to mark milestones and memories. There are two main styles of bracelet: one with larger links (stations) at intervals to attach the charms, or squarer-looking open links with enough gaps to attach the charm anywhere on the bracelet. Many newer charms clip easily into place, like Astley Clarke’s (from £38) and lilycharmed.com’s biscuit charms (£40). With vintage charms, attach them with a jump ring and jewellery pliers (gift a set with the bracelet; Hobbycraft and Amazon sell sets). How you build it depends on personal aesthetic. If you prefer a certain level of uniformity, a Pandora bracelet will work well (charms from £25). My favourites are more unique charms found after a good rummage at an antiques market or a scroll on Etsy. Anninavogel.com specialises in Victorian solid-gold charms (from £150), with everything from tiny cake stands, to galleons, to an intricate gumball machine. If you’re impatient and want it already completed, Alex Monroe’s LOVE bracelet (£375) has a whimsical feel. Helen Seamons, stylist, the Observer Magazine 20. What’s the best way to shine and keep your jewellery clean? Most reputable jewellers offer free basic cleaning, but care is needed since some gemstones and materials are sensitive to heat, chemicals and vibrations. Ultrasonic cleaners, which use water and detergent, are effective, but can be harsh on delicate pieces. At home, I always recommend people use a regular toothbrush (maybe one no longer in use for dental hygiene) with warm water and dish soap solution to gently clean their jewellery. Focus on hard-to-reach areas, like behind the stones. Rinse, shake off excess moisture and dry with a paper towel. A polishing cloth works well for larger surfaces, followed by rinsing and drying. For tarnish, use a silver-dip solution (mainly for silver or gold-plated pieces). Be sure to use in a well-ventilated area, as it contains ammonia and smells like bad eggs. Shine on!

          "headline": "European form offers Rangers boost for League Cup final clash with Celtic",
          "bodyText": "The Scottish League Cup final suddenly feels like less of a formality. Rangers’ only regret will be the event, when they once again try to puncture Celtic’s domestic dominance, does not take place on a Thursday evening. Their performance in holding Tottenham served as the latest example of Rangers excelling in Europe. The consistent problem has been bringing such form back to the Scottish scene. However, the 6-0 trouncing of Kilmarnock and 3-0 win at Ross County before Spurs visited Ibrox suggested maybe, just maybe, Philippe Clement can have the last laugh over his many dissenters. Rangers could, and arguably should, have beaten Spurs. Focus on them and their woes was understandable; Rangers played with a bravery that felt like a throwback. Results depict Celtic as an immovable object but there was defensive frailty even during last Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Hibernian. Brendan Rodgers bemoaned bluntness as Dinamo Zagreb scratched out a scoreless home draw with the Scottish champions. Rangers will arrive at Hampden Park with tails up; a situation that will be sufficient for Celtic to know their level of performance is far from immaterial this time. That the League Cup eluded Rodgers last season was largely forgotten as Celtic recovered from a rocky opening to the campaign. The potential filling of that gap provides motivation. Yet this is also an occasion that must sustain and fulfil Rodgers. Celtic compete week upon week in a desperately noncompetitive environment, meaning even the sense of a meaningful scrap has to appeal. Celtic are not involved in nearly enough of them, despite regular claims to the contrary. “We never expect just to turn up and it is a formality,” he said. “It is definitely not that, irrespective of form going into a final.” Rodgers drew breath when asked on Friday about Clement’s assertion that Rangers are clear underdogs on the basis of financial status. This is a perennially thorny subject where the Old Firm are concerned. Clement even irked his own supporters by appearing to raise the white flag. That irritation was doused by the strength of the showing against Spurs. Rodgers’s defence is that Celtic have “organically” grown as opposed to receiving funding from a wealthy owner or Middle Eastern state. The point is valid, although nobody sensible has ever accused Celtic of building their riches by unsustainable means. It is a simple reality that Celtic powered into a different economic stratosphere than all but one club in Scotland long ago. This naturally affects how sporting success can be categorised by those outside of Scotland’s bubble. Rodgers will never admit it – indeed, it would be professionally harmful to do so – but Celtic winning domestically is met with shrugs from a wider world. This season, kudos has been earned through generally strong Champions League showings. Clement erred on two counts. While Celtic’s Champions League involvement on top of existing cash position – they had £77m in the bank even before the £30m sale of Matt O’Riley – makes Rangers look like the poor relation, the scale of spending at Ibrox over the past decade has not actually been the issue. It has routinely been similar to Celtic’s, in fact. Instead, Rangers have wasted relative fortunes on unsuitable players. Clement also has nothing to offer on balance sheet gulfs when Rangers draw with Dundee United or edge past St Johnstone. Logic suggests Celtic still have too much in the forward areas for a Rangers defence who seem to panic every time they see green and white hoops. If John Souttar, Rangers’ stand-out defensive performer this season, fails to recover from the injury picked up against Spurs then Rodgers must rub his hands. The Celtic midfield has been an unsettled one; at its best, it is also superior to what Rangers have to offer. Clement has yet to taste Old Firm victory, which is hardly a shocking statistic given relative strength but one which those critics can hit the Belgian with. The manager himself cites player turnover as evidence what transpired last season need not be relevant in this. “It is about this game, with these players,” said the 50-year-old. Clement will be treated favourably if he tries something different in a bid to trip up Celtic. If he upsets the odds and Rodgers, thereby retaining the League Cup, Clement will have a level of leeway few thought possible even in October. This is a final carrying more intrigue than most."

          "bodyText": "Geoff Lemon looks at India captain Rohit Sharma’s call to send Australia in to bat first and what it might mean for the remaining days at the Gabba. That should do for a pretty skinny day one OBO. The Test in a nutshell: India won the toss and chose to bowl in what promised to be helpful conditions. For 13.2 overs the ball didn’t move as much laterally as expected, despite overcast and humid conditions and a pitch with plenty of grass on it. It didn’t help that India bowled too short, as touring sides are prone to do at the Gabba. Usman Khawaja played a few nice shots for his 19* and Nathan McSweeney looked solid for his 4*. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow with play starting at 9:50 local time (10:50 AEDT) with a target of 98 overs to be bowled in the day, although more rain is forecast (albeit not as heavy or persistent as we saw today). Angus Fontaine is on the tools to begin with, then I’ll see you after lunch. Catch you then. The umpires have mercifully called time on the waiting game around an hour before the scheduled close of play. Just 13.2 overs were possible on a rain-soaked day in Brisbane. Action will resume tomorrow and all following days at 9.50am local (10.50am AEDT) with a minimum 98 overs to be bowled. Looking ahead to tomorrow, while this recently issued thunderstorm warning doesn’t extend to Brisbane, it comes pretty close, suggesting play on day two may well be disrupted. There are just 80 minutes remaining until the scheduled close of play. It’s been raining pretty much non-stop for the past five hours, often torrentially. The radar indicates more rain to come. Someone call play off for the day, please and thank you. That brief moment of optimism is probably over. It’s raining again at the Gabba and the radar indicates that second band of rain coming from the south east is making its presence felt. I’d expect play will be cancelled for the day sooner rather than later. AAP are more optimistic… Tea has officially been taken. The umpires will soon make an inspection of the sodden Gabba, but a second band of rain from the south east is stalking Brisbane. Southee perishes for 23 off 10 deliveries. He should have one more knock to complete a century of sixes. Meanwhile in New Zealand, Tim Southee is batting in his final Test. He walked out with 95 centuries under his belt, and has swiftly moved to 98. Tremendous entertainment late in the day in Hamilton Earlier on Martin introduced the concept of an Australia/India combined XI, and Stefan is the latest to email in his contribution, and yet another to mystifyingly exclude Nathan Lyon; surely the best spin bowler in the world in Australian conditions, and a man that’s proved himself time and again is more than a luxury even in conditions that preference pace bowling. “Following on from the previous convo, surprised everyone’s backing Jadeja when India couldn’t even find room for him earlier. As much as he’s done spectacular things in the past, he’s pretty long in the tooth now. If we’re talking all-rounders, I’m much more inclined to Reddy, he’s looked the goods so far this series. I’d say my XI would be: Jaiswal, Rahul, Gill, Kohli, Head, Marsh, Pant (wk), Reddy, Cummins (c), Bumrah, Hazlewood. Tempted to slip Starc in there as well for an all-time pace attack, but three quicks and two all-rounders ought to cover it. No need for spinners if you’re not gonna bowl them, and the way these tests have looked they’ve never had a chance. Besides Starc, Carey is the harshest exclusion, but competing with Pant’s a tough ask.” We’re now in the window of the conventional Tea interval (3-3.20pm local time / 4-4.20pm AEDT) so at best we’re down to a single session of play. There remains a slim chance of action later this evening with rain almost coming to a halt at the Gabba, but the covers remain over the square for the time being and a major dry-up operation will be required to satisfy the umpires the outfield and run-ups are safe. Then there’s the light to take into consideration because it’s still gloomy despite the rain relenting. And even if all of those dominoes fall the way you would hope, the window for play is likely only to be brief, with more rain coming in from the south east. There’s cricket happening across the Tasman where New Zealand are hosting England in the final Test of their series. And after a strong opening stand in Hamilton the hosts are capitulating. They’ve collapsed from 105-0 to 231-7. England are hunting a series whitewash. The weather front that has interrupted play is very slow moving. It has hung over the Brisbane region all afternoon, inching it’s way inland to the north west, dumping its load along the way. The Gabba has moved from being at the thundery, westerly edge of the band of rain, to more to the drizzly east (which is theoretically positive) but the rain is still falling, there is more on the way, and the clean up will take some time. There will be no play any time soon, and perhaps no more before the close at this rate. Thank you very much Martin, and hello everybody, I hope you’re all in the mood for some radar watching, because I can’t see any play before Tea, and perhaps not for some time afterwards. This of course means there are plenty of column inches to fill if you have something you want to communicate. Emails to jonathan.howcroft.casual@guardian.co.uk please. Thanks for following along even as rain interrupted play. It was an engaging opening period after Rohit Sharma sent Australia in then the hosts took command across 5.3 overs until the first delay. The India bowlers were better after the break and brought the run-rate almost to a halt across another 7.5 overs until the storm set in. The radars and forecast suggest we should get some more play this afternoon – fingers … are … crossed! Here is Jonathan Howcroft. I’m about to hand the reins to Jonathan Howcroft so will drop my combined XI now. The task was easier set than done, so I’ve narrowed my focus to 2024 form rather than hard-earned reputations. The toughest call was going with the all-rounder talents of Jadeja over the spin-and-nightwatchman record of Lyon. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Usman Khawaja, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Travis Head, Rishabh Pant (wk), Mitch Marsh, Ravindra Jadeja, Pat Cummins (capt), Jasprit Bumrah, Josh Hazlewood. ‪FrayFray‬ ‪has thrown up another combined XI contender, which they add “shows Australia relying on the individual brilliance of too few at the moment”. Thoughts on this XI filled with firepower? Jaiswal, Rahul, Gill, Kohli (just), Head, Marsh, Pant, Jadeja, Starc, Cummins, Bumrah. The rain is persisting at the Gabba and we’re now eating into the day one action but there is more than enough time to get a result. While the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is surely the priority for both teams at this stage, the World Test Championship also looms large with Australia and India battling for a spot in the final now most likely against South Africa. India are the most at risk of paying a price if rain ruins this contest with the two-time WTC runner-up needing to win all three remaining Tests against Australia to guarantee qualification to another final. If Australia regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time since 2014-15, they would almost certainly return to the final after beating India in the 2023 decider. Australia could still qualify for the final if the series against India is drawn 2-2, with two Tests in Sri Lanka to play early next year. Much still to play out, but we have time to ponder the permutations and calculations at the moment. Combined XI watch: tullyeh is among the first readers to have a shot at the combined XI from the two teams lining up at the Gabba for the third Test. Hard to argue with most of this – and particularly the reason for backing Pant and Head – though a change that immediately comes to mind for me is bringing in Hazlewood for Starc. “Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Gill, Smith, Head, Marsh, Pant, Jadeja, Cummins, Starc, Bumrah. Smith is in on reputation only and I hate to leave Carey out. I’m a South Aussie &amp; watched him dominate Shield this season but Pant &amp; Head, you only need one to fire and it’s game won.” The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is now firmly among the major events on the cricket calendar, or more broadly on what is known in industry circles as the “Future Tours Program”. But it remains hard to compare to the Ashes which will be returning to Australian shores next year. To whet the appetite a little, in an extract from his new book, Stephen Brenkley explains the fervour and political intrigue stirred by Australia’s tour of Britain in 1926. Going out on a limb here but think we have time to put together a combined XI from the two lineups currently sitting in the stands at the Gabba. Send your team through on email or @martinpegan on Bluesky or X – this is who we’re choosing from: Australia: Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (capt), Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood. India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Rohit Sharma (capt), Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep. We haven’t lost too much time yet, and these two sides have not needed anything approaching the full five days to secure a result across the opening two Tests in the series, but no one likes a rain delay. ‪Jack’s defunct follicle is on Bluesky and thinking outside the square. “Surely cricket can benefit from organisers checking AccuWeather on their smartphones and changing venues? Its got a fairly decent advance weather prediction model.” A bright idea, and I am a fan of AccuWeather, but I suspect there could be a few logistical challenges with shifting venues at short-ish notice. Lunch has been called at 12.20pm local time in Brisbane/1.20pm AEDT with a bit of rain still hanging around. A reminder that India won the toss and elected to field with signs of life in the pitch and clouds overhead, while Australia’s openers were largely untroubled to end the rain-interrupted first session on 28-0 from 13.2 overs. The rain is bucketing down now and puddles are forming around the Gabba. The surface water does tend to clear quickly at the venue but we seem to be some way off a return. It is probably a good time to take lunch, both for the players in Brisbane and those watching on elsewhere. Or, alternatively, tune in to how New Zealand and England are faring across the ditch. It has been a solid start for Australia with both openers still in place after 13.2 overs. The runs were starting to flow, particularly off Khawaja’s bat, before the first rain delay allowed the India bowlers to reconsider their plans. ‪ philby17 is concerned that Australia’s commentators in general are giving up a bit too much inside info; “your thoughts on Aust TV providing info re how best to bowl on Aust pitches and how to get out individual Aussie batsmen? A boon for the Indian team? By contrast, I never hear Indian commentators speak of how one should bowl on Indian pitches.” A fair point though I perhaps naively would expect the India coaches and analysts to be across the conditions and their opponents as much as former players and pundits. 14th over: Australia 28-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) A pair of dot balls from Akash Deep before the umpires give in the drizzle as it turns heavier. The covers are back on! 13th over: Australia 28-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) Siraj is back and so are the jeers from the Gabba crowd. A better over from the India pacer who disappointed in his short opening spell. A maiden to Khawaja but the greater concern is the skies darkening. 12th over: Australia 28-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) Australia have their highest opening stand of the series so far with Khawaja and McSweeney looking relatively comfortable. Akash Deep keeps working away at McSweeney from a good length and finds the pads with the last two balls of the over. A half-hearted appeal from the latter is waved away. 11th over: Australia 28-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) Bumrah sends down his sixth over helped by a rain delay half way through the spell. More runs for Khawaja on the leg side, this time a single to square leg. McSweeney finds his first runs off the bat against Bumrah today when caressing the ball to fine leg. India are drifting onto the pads too often. 10th over: Australia 26-0 (Khawaja 18, McSweeney 3) McSweeney with the tightest of tight leaves as the first ball of the over angles in to fly just over the off stump. The opener dabs off his hip for a single on the leg side, as Khawaja works one off his pads for the same. 9th over: Australia 24-0 (Khawaja 17, McSweeney 2) Bumrah and Khawaja continue their gripping battle. The Australian opener is comfortable leaving anything he isn’t forced to play at but looks to drive the fifth delivery through cover. Not enough behind the shot and it is cut off. Khawaja dabs at a wider ball to end the over but soft hands ensure the thick edge doesn’t carry KL Rahul at first slip. Another maiden as the runs have dried up. 8th over: Australia 24-0 (Khawaja 17, McSweeney 2) Akash Deep comes into the attack in place of Siraj who barely threatened through his three overs. The pacer immediately pitches the ball up and finds some movement to force McSweeney to play outside his off-stump. The right-hander has a swing later in the over at a delivery that is back of a length and is fortunate that the ball moved as much as it did. Maiden over. 7th over: Australia 24-0 (Khawaja 17, McSweeney 2) Bumrah bowls to McSweeney for the first time today after dismissing Australia’s newest opener three times in the first two Tests. McSweeney is immediately back off strike after Bumrah drifts across the right-hander and the ball clips the pads for a leg bye. Khawaja if left jumping around the crease but sees out the rest of the over. 6th over: Australia 23-0 (Khawaja 17, McSweeney 2) Siraj sends down the second half of his third over before we were rudely interrupted by rain. A leg slip is in place for Khawaja as Siraj finds a bit of movement back into the left-hander. Even after the break, Khawaja picks up another ball short of a length and pulls over square leg for four. Good news! Play will resume at 11.15am local time/12.15pm AEDT. The India bowlers have already been in the outfield rolling the arm over in preparation. The lunch break has been pushed back to 12.50pm local time/13.50pm AEDT. We have movement in the middle of the Gabba and the covers are slowly being pulled away. Play is set to resume shortly but in the meantime let us know what you’ve made of India’s call to bowl first, Jasprit Bumrah’s current condition and how Australia handled the first half hour? HMU on email or @martinpegan on Bluesky or X. A timely email from Tim Thomas has quickly turned to the bright side of this rain delay. “Bit of a humid wet weekend ahead in Brisbane, might help the match go the distance, but I’m not sure what team that would favour. Groundspeople will have their work cut out for them for sure. Keen for a more traditional battle!” 6th over: Australia 19-0 (Khawaja 13, McSweeney 2) The covers are on! Siraj gets through three deliveries to McSweeney, and the right-hander bunts a defensive shot to mid-on for a quick single. Khawaja is slow off the mark to momentarily put Australian hearts in mouths but is across the line by the time the throw comes in. India might not mind the opportunity to regroup, as the first half hour has favoured the Australia openers. 5th over: Australia 18-0 (Khawaja 13, McSweeney 1) Bumrah to Khawaja yet again as the left-hander has faced all of the India strike bowler’s deliveries so far. The left-hander has been quite comfortable with Bumrah perhaps lacking a bit of zip. Khawaja is working the ball nicely off his pads, as he tends to do, and glances about as fine as you can for four. We have a couple of early comments as excitement builds around a series that has so far lived up to the sky-high expectations. borisfeigin has been in touch on Bluesky to say, “Once again we observe the power of Test cricket. People will remember what happened last time and probably what happens in this game for a long time, possibly decades. Meanwhile, can anyone recall without Google what happened in last year’s BBL final? “Visiting captains and deciding to bowl at the Gabba. Usually a brave (in a Sir Humphrey sense) call but the pitch does look quite lush.” The BBL season is kicking off this weekend and is always an enjoyable part of the Australian summer, but I catch your drift borisfeigin. 4th over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 9, McSweeney 1) McSweeney nudges off his pads for a quick single from the first delivery as Australia rotate the strike for the first time. Khawaja picks up a couple at fine leg as Siraj drifts onto his pads, then the left-hander punishes a shorter ball with a sublime pull shot for four through midwicket. It has been a positive start for Australia and India ask for the ball to be checked – it passes through the rings without any issue. 3rd over: Australia 6-0 (Khawaja 2, McSweeney 0) Bumrah continues around the wicket to Khawaja and beats the bat with a delivery that drifts away late from the left-hander. That’s the first time Bumrah has been able to extract a bit of zing as he looks a little below top pace. Khawaja plays off his pads to pick up a couple of runs through midwicket, the first off the bat this morning. 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Khawaja 0, McSweeney 0) Siraj to McSweeney and the India quick is straight into working away at a good length outside off. Not much movement for Siraj and the third-gamer is untroubled. Maiden over. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Khawaja 0, McSweeney 0) Bumrah has Khawaja all cramped up from the second delivery with plenty of movement taking the ball across the left-hander. But the delivery misses the edge and canons into Khawaja’s thigh. Four runs come off the thigh pad from the next delivery as Khawaja looks to play to fine leg. The national anthems are complete, Jasprit Bumrah has the cherry in hand, Usman Khawaja is taking two centres and we’re ready to play. India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Rohit Sharma (capt), Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep. A couple of changes for the tourists with their third spinner selected in as many Tests, this time Jadeja selected in place of Ashwin. Akash Deep is also recalled. Australia: Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (capt), Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood. As revealed yesterday, Hazlewood has proven his fitness after sitting out the second Test due to a side strain. Scott Boland is left out in the only change to the side that won by 10 wickets at the Adelaide Oval. Pat Cummins plays his cards up against his chest when asked what he would have done if Australia won the toss. That says as much as anything, but here is more from the Australia skipper. It has been a fantastic series so far. I think we have a sell-out at the Gabba today. I am sure it is going to be lively out there. Just about everyone got themselves into the series and ... now here at the Gabba, a place we like playing at. It’s been a good lead-in. Rohit Sharma calls “heads” correctly and chooses to bowl first. A little bit overcast. Bit of grass and looks soft. We want to try to make the best use of the conditions and see what we can do with the ball up-front. As the game goss on it will get better and better to bat. But we want to try and make the best use of the conditions up-front. There is a nice green tinge on top of the pitch which is one of few remaining natural decks, rather than drop-in wickets, across international cricket. There is a bit of cloud hovering overhead and a slight chance of showers amid a forecast high of 29. The captains are in the middle for the toss. Travis Head is one Australian batter who has underwhelmed at the Gabba in recent times, with a pair of golden ducks in the Test against West Indies earlier this. That followed a 92 and another first-ball duck when Australia faced South Africa in late 2022, meaning the right-hander has been dismissed with his past four balls faced in Brisbane Tests. But the middle-order powerhouse carries strong form into this third Test after making 140 against India in his hometown Adelaide last week. Head and India pacer Mohammed Siraj had some choice words with each other as the rivalry and tension around a tight series begin to bubble away. The ICC were not impressed. Australia was undefeated at the Gabba across 31 Tests between 1989 and 2021 when India upset the hosts with a three-wicket victory to hold onto the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a 2-1 series win. Geoff Lemon has looked at how the Gabba has changed over time, and the recent shifts that could help Australia rebuild their domination at the venue. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first day of the third Test between Australia and India. The scene is set for a thriller after a couple of thrashings went either way as the tourists took an early lead in the series in Perth then Australia bounced back in Adelaide. Both sides have a history of success in Brisbane, where the third Test will be played at the Gabba. Australia did not lose at their home fortress for more than 30 years until stunned by an injury-plagued India the last time they met here. A loss to West Indies earlier this year was even more of a shock. Josh Hazlewood will be a welcome addition to the Australia XI at a venue where his natural bounce can turn into a weapon. Scott Boland is the unfortunate pace bowler to make way, as he has so many times before, despite taking five wickets in the win at the Adelaide Oval. While Australia will have their full array of quicks, their batting remains the concern and all eyes will be on Steve Smith as the No 4 has his latest shot at breaking out of a form slump. India are in a similar position with their attack centred around the at-times unplayable Jasprit Bumrah. The 31-year-old is under an injury cloud after suffering groin soreness in Adelaide but is expect to be named in Brisbane. The tourists’ batting lineup has been feast or famine with captain Rohit Sharma standing out as the player most in need of runs, perhaps from his more familiar role at the top of the order. First ball will be at 10:20am local time or 11:20pm AEDT. I’ll be seeing us through the first session and a half, when Jonathan Howcroft will take the reins. The toss and confirmation of the teams are coming shortly. Get in touch with any comments, questions, thoughts and predictions – shoot me an email or find me @martinpegan on Bluesky or X. Let’s get into it!"

          "bodyText": "Felix Weatherall, the London producer best known as Ross From Friends, has spent much of his career escaping other people’s preconceptions. He emerged in the mid-2010s as the most popular face of the so-called “lo-fi house” or “YouTube house” scene – not really a scene, as much as a collection of producers making analog-sounding dance music that algorithms loved – and since then has worked hard to show he has more to offer than just supremely curated vibes. His latest project, under the alias Bubble Love, is a sharp pivot away from sepia-toned gauziness: it’s a high-energy pop-club record that’s extremely fun, if far from groundbreaking. Bubble Love often sounds like the work of someone who only just discovered contemporary alternative dance music, which is not a knock. Believe, a warm, jazz-sampling take on the frisky stop-start of Canadian producer Kaytranada, is both sensual and party-starting; Double Caper and Faceless capture the twinkle and shine of great nu-disco. Hate, a furious, minimalist garage track, and &lt;3 &lt;3, which combines calypso drums, a lithe Houston hip-hop guitar line and unnerving computerised vocal samples, feel like appropriately disorientating Two Shell tributes. You walk away knowing little about Bubble Love as a project, but certainly not having had a bad time."

          "headline": "‘His eyes were not smiling’: guide tearfully recalls British music producer’s diving death off Byron Bay",
          "bodyText": "A dive guide has tearfully recalled the moment she found a British music producer lying motionless on his back on the ocean floor during a scuba tour off the coast of Byron Bay in New South Wales. Karl Bareham died during a dive tour of Ngnuthungulli/Julian Rocks on 24 September 2019. He had arrived in Australia the day before and was to tour with City and Colour musician Dallas Green. On the fourth day of the inquest into Bareham’s death, the NSW coroner’s court heard that the 37-year-old had trouble equalising as he descended, then encountered problems with buoyancy. His guide, Yuko Inagaki, said she helped adjust Bareham’s buoyancy before leading the group of four divers towards a shallow area known as the nursery. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email She said that Bareham was not more than four metres away when she saw he was lying on the ocean floor, partially obstructed by a rock that she guessed he was trying to look under. She immediately swam to him and saw his regulator was out of his mouth. Initially, she thought he might be making a ring-shaped bubble, a diving trick. She was not concerned, she said, “until I saw his face.” “His eyes were not smiling,” she said. “You can tell in a face that [someone’s having] fun, but it didn’t look like that at all”. She attempted to put Bareham’s regulator back into his mouth “once or twice” before moving him into a vertical position and starting an emergency ascent with him. While her four clients were buddied up in pairs, the counsel assisting the coroner, Rob Ranken, questioned why Inagaki did not dive with a buddy, as was usual diving protocol. “If you got into some trouble, there was nobody who was responsible [for rendering aid to you]?” Ranken asked. Earlier in the proceedings, the court heard that Bareham may have had an alcohol withdrawal syndrome seizure – in part evidenced by a partially bitten-through mouthpiece lug. Inagaki said she did not think there was any damage to the mouthpiece before the dive and Bareham did not say the mouthpiece was damaged. Earlier on Thursday, magistrate David O’Neil heard that Sundive’s equipment was serviced by a staff member who was not a qualified to do so, and that the dive business had “imprecise” equipment logs. At the time of Bareham’s death, there was no system for recording when a piece of equipment was being used and how many times it had been used, Sundive’s sub-contracted technician, Tom Hughes, confirmed. The court heard that the diving equipment brand, Mares, specifies that its regulators should be serviced every 100 dives or every year, and should be given a complete overhaul every 200 dives or two years. While regulators at the company were given an overhaul once a year, Ranken suggested the Sundive regulators may have been used as many times as 200 times a year – something that Hughes said was “very unlikely”. Ranken suggested that maintaining accurate records was necessary, “particularly when members of the public are relying on that equipment.” Hughes told the court he became aware of a staff member who was not a certified technician was servicing equipment without supervision. He had not instructed her to do so, he said, nor did he check the work she had carried out unsupervised. He said that a Mares representative that had given him verbal approval to provide on-the-job training to the staff member. The court heard he was not certified to provide servicing training. The barrister representing Sundive and its directors, Patrick Barry, questioned the wording of the Mares servicing instructions. Neither of the company’s directors serviced regulators, according to Hughes. Hughes said a WorkSafe interview conducted in relation to Bareham’s death in 2020 was intimidating and pushed him to the verge of a panic attack. Over the proceedings, the court has heard that Bareham’s chronic alcoholism may have triggered a medical episode while he was underwater. Parts of his hired regulator set were deemed to be working outside manufacturers’ specifications in tests by diving experts five weeks after the incident – though the court heard those measurements may have been inaccurate. Five witnesses remain to take the stand. The inquest is scheduled to conclude on Friday."

          "bodyText": "World premieres starring Olivia Colman, Jennifer Lopez and Josh O’Connor spearhead the lineup of next month’s Sundance film festival. The Utah-based festival will showcase 87 feature films from 33 different countries and territories. Oscar-winner Colman will lead Jimpa, a drama from the writer-director Sophie Hyde who has previously been at the festival with Animals and Good Luck to You, Leo Grande. Colman plays a mother taking her non-binary teenager to visit their gay grandfather, played by John Lithgow. Lopez, who has previously been at Sundance with thriller Lila and Eve, will be present with a new version of Kiss of the Spider-Woman, based on the 1992 stage musical written by the late Terrence McNally. She has called it her most “challenging” role to date. “It’s a dark story, but also one about love and survival – about helping each other through hard times,” Lopez said to Variety. “I think that’s a message we really need right now.” Fresh off his breakout role in Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers, Josh O’Connor will star in the world premiere of Rebuilding as a rancher coping with the loss of his farm after a wildfire. The film also stars the White Lotus breakout Meghann Fahy. Benedict Cumberbatch will be heading to Park City with the dark grief drama The Thing with Feathers playing a father who believes a sinister presence is stalking his family after his wife dies. It’s based on the acclaimed book by Max Porter, which was also turned into a stage play. Ben Whishaw will be reuniting with the Passages director Ira Sachs for Peter Hujar’s Day, playing the legendary photographer Peter Hujar in a drama also starring Rebecca Hall as the writer Linda Rosenkrantz. Timely new documentaries premiering at the festival include The Librarians, about the fight against book banning in Texas, Heightened Scrutiny, about anti-trans legislation in the US, and Mr Nobody Against Putin, following a teacher in Russia pushing back against propaganda. There will also be new documentaries on Jeff Buckley, the Zodiac Killer, Jacinda Adern, Selena Quintanilla, Marlee Matlin and To Catch a Predator. In the main dramatic competition this year, there will be films such as the Luca Guadagnino-produced Atropia about a military role-playing facility starring Alia Shawkat and Callum Turner, the cabbage-smuggling comedy Bubble &amp; Squeak starring Himesh Patel, the 90s-set drama Plainclothes about an undercover cop falling in love with another man starring Russell Tovey, the Cary Fukunaga-produced drama Ricky starring Stephan James as a man navigating life post-incarceration and the dark comedy Sorry, Baby produced by Barry Jenkins. Other premieres include a remake of Ang Lee’s 1993 comedy The Wedding Banquet starring Lily Gladstone and Bowen Yang, the A24 music industry thriller Opus starring Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich, the folk horror Rabbit Trap with Dev Patel, the British comedy The Ballad of Wallis Island starring Tim Key and Carey Mulligan, the Safdie brothers-produced comedy drama If I Had Legs I’d Kick You with Rose Byrne, Conan O’Brien and A$AP Rocky and Train Dreams, a period drama starring Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones from the team behind Sing Sing. Juliette Lewis will also star in By Design as a woman who swaps bodies with a chair. Of the films announced, 47% were directed by one or more film-makers who identify as women while 45% were directed by one or more film-makers of colour. “This year’s program is ready to meet our audiences, the industry, and the wider culture in a moment of many global questions,” said the festival director, Eugene Hernandez. “The works our artists will debut at our upcoming Festival will spark conversation and invite connection. We’re excited to be sharing these moments of discovery together with our communities soon and thankful to our artists for entrusting us with their stories.” Last year’s festival saw the world premieres of Love Lies Bleeding, I Saw the TV Glow, A Real Pain, Didi, A Different Man and Will &amp; Harper. Next year’s will take place from 23 January to 2 February."

          "headline": "UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: what is the back condition the suspect could have suffered from?",
          "bodyText": "Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, appears to have suffered from a back condition called spondylolisthesis, according to posts linked to him on the social media site Reddit. While not confirmed, archived Reddit posts under the username “Mister_Cactus” and elements of Mangione’s other social media accounts, as well as an account by a friend, seem to confirm that he suffered from a back condition that caused him chronic pain. “Fwiw I’m 25 years old with a L5/S1 fusion. It’s clear to me that the day my spondy went bad to the point where I felt it every day, I had crossed the threshold into surgery though it took me a year to realize this,” he commented in April this year, according to the archived posts. Spondylolisthesis is a fracture or weakness in the vertebrae of the spine, sometimes caused by playing certain sports as a child, which can cause the vertebra to shift or slip, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. If the slip is classified as high-grade, it can cause “significant pain and nerve injury and to need surgery to relieve their symptoms and prevent further deterioration”. Surgical treatment can involve spinal treatment and “stabilization with rods and screws”. Mangione’s banner image on X included an X-ray image that appears to show rods and screws inserted into the lower spine. In one Reddit post, from July 2023, the Reddit user complained of pain that had grown more extreme after a surfing accident and a slip, writing: “Yea when I went surfing 1.5 years ago, I experienced sciatica for the first time. Basically the extension movement destabilized my spondy. A few weeks later I slipped on a piece of paper and my right glute locked and right leg shut down for a week.” RJ Martin, a friend and former roommate of Mangione’s, told CNN on Monday that soon after Mangione moved to Hawaii, he was “in bed for about a week” with back pain after a surfing lesson. “It was really traumatic and difficult, you know, when you’re in your early 20s and you can’t, you know, do some basic things,” Martin said. The Reddit user encouraged other users to get surgery. “To be honest, once the pain becomes low-grade but all the time, it could be time for surgery,” they wrote in April this year. “I mean the situation sucks for sure, but the solution isn’t to retreat into a bubble.”"

          "bodyText": "A short story based on the real-life deportation of Chinese seafarers from the UK after the second world war has won this year’s 4thWrite prize. Fleeting Marrow by Yan F Zhang spans eight decades, telling the life story of a woman named Joy as she builds a life while navigating the absence of her father and son. The competition, run by publisher 4th Estate and the Guardian and now in its eighth year, is open to writers of colour living in the UK and Ireland. The winner receives £1,000, a publishing workshop at 4th Estate and publication of their story on the Guardian website. Fleeting Marrow is an “ambitious and affecting story of family and history that is remarkable in what it achieves in so few pages”, said Kishani Widyaratna, publisher at 4th Estate. It takes the “raw source material” of “historical tragedy and transforms it into something truly moving”, said journalist and judge Zing Tsjeng. In 2022, the Home Office admitted that Chinese seafarers were coerced into boats leaving Liverpool after the war in a “racially inflected and prejudicial” secret government programme. Also on the judging panel were authors Sheena Patel and Laline Paull, Guardian fiction editor Justine Jordan and literary agent Emma Leong. Yan’s story “is a distinctively fearsome and memorable performance”, said Leong. “This story holds an earnest understanding of innocence when left to a life of harrowing loss and political sorrow, whilst cleverly underscoring a vivacious and urgent sense of wonder, hope and possibility”. Other writers shortlisted for this year’s prize were Anvi Prabhu, Marcella Marx, Priyanka Verma, Vee Matsumari and Isabella Peralta. Matsumari received a special commendation for their story The Sound of Water. “‘A polished and confident stylist, with impressive control of their material and emotional depth,” said Jordan. “From the first line, you feel for the narrator and you want to know more. Every sentence is a pleasure to read.” Last year’s winner was Tian Yi for her story The Good Son. Writers previously recognised through the award include Bolu Babalola, author of Love in Colour and Honey &amp; Spice, and Guy Gunaratne, whose novel In Our Mad and Furious City won the Dylan Thomas and Jhalak prizes. *** Fleeting Marrow by Yan F Zhang 0. Born in 1939, Joy always lived her life as if it would never end, as if she walked a fairground that could never shut. Like everybody else, despite wearing a watch and always having a sense of time, always keeping count, life tread past, furtive and soft. Some years bounded by in a blur; almost nothing stuck in her memory. Were they terrible years she had wished from her mind? Or just ones that didn’t weigh enough to warrant the brain space? Many years did stick, though. 2. Her older brother, Felix, two years ahead of her in life, was evacuated to Newtown, Wales, where everything was brand new with tags on from the shops, Joy imagined. At not quite two, Joy was too small for evacuation alone. Joy’s mother couldn’t bear to leave her husband so they stayed. When bangs whooshed overhead they all squeezed together, clasped to each other. Joy rested against her mother, nose touching her pearl necklace, feeling her heartbeat through her breast, as if they shared the same one. 3. Three years old was the first time Joy noticed how different she looked to Mama, and even more so from everybody else outside home. 5. The First Day of School. 1944, A new law enacted – free education for all aged 5-15 years old. The beginning was slow. She spoke little, made no friends. The teacher saw her at the playground’s corner, plucking petals off a wilting dandelion with thumb and forefinger. “Not sure the flower enjoys that, Joy.” Miss Hockeridge smiled, stretching out a hand. Joy shrugged, held her hand. The two of them strolled amongst the gaggle. “That one’s an elephant!” Joy cried, pointing skywards at the bulbous clouds. “Chasing a banana.” There was an eagle with claws aimed at prey, an upside down birthday cake with candles floating away. 6. Joy missed school for months when she caught whooping cough. Uncontrollable hacking fits invaded her. Returning to class, she had to learn to hold pencils again, her fingers like chicken claws around the impossibly slim wood. Everything was exhausting. She yawned too much and was noted as not-for-grammar-school. Whole days slowed then; dragging, dragging, dragging. 7. Joy learned to tell time from the neighbour, a girl babysitting for pocket money. “Hear that ticking?” They both tilted their heads closer to the old clock a far-away uncle had gifted. “Now, this is important.” The long spindle moved forwards, never backwards. Once a second passed, it never came back again. The seconds added up to minutes, days, months, and years. Once a birthday was celebrated, the same number never returned. Ever. The certainty of these matters made Joy shudder, made her insides quiver, almost as much as the uncertainty did. The uncertainty with what to do with all the seconds. 8. Summer, 1947. Father was taken. Repatriated. Mama took on sewing, late into the night, under candlelight to save electricity. Joy tried to help but kept sticking pins into her fingers, leaving little bloody spots on expensive fabric. “Oh my days! That’s not part of the pattern.” Her mother grabbed the material away. They never had enough soap to spare. “We need returning customers.” They all dug hard at the allotment and lugged home juicy marrows. Mama made soup. The creamy vegetable core, steeped in broth, melted in their mouths, gone all too quick. 9. Mama brought Humphrey home and ordered, “You must call him Dad, from now on.” Joy made faces with her brother, who rolled his eyes. “But he looks like a grandad, like a prune with grey hair.” “Shhhh!” “Why? He probably can’t hear us.” Dad Humphrey moved them south away from Merseyside. Mama seemed peaceful, glad to wave a hand to the tittle-tattle, not knowing they’d never elude it. 10. They moved into a narrow, terraced house with a long back garden, full of jumbled nettles dotted with plump blackberries. Joy befriended next door’s Vivien, a fair-haired girl the same age. Vivien was in a drama club. She pulled Joy along, but others raised their eyebrows, tittered. “Joy, why should you go?” Who could she play? Nobody looked like her on stage or screen. “Why are you funny-looking?” Joy had never thought so. “Why don’t you look anything like your ma, or your dad?” Vivien peered at her too, as if pondering this for the first time. “Your ma has yellow hair. Yours is almost black.” Like her father’s had been. 11. A more wonderful discovery – the local library. Joy began spending all spare seconds with her head amongst the pages and bindings. 12. Elation – first employment in a local corner shop. Joy was still small, barely taller than the counter, and too slow, much too slow to notice the tall man, wild fingers pocketing jars from the shelves. Joy was smacked. She ran, tears flying from her cheeks as she fled, but she wiped them clean before reaching her doorstep. 13. Memories of Dad left too fast, faded too swift like a morning mist after sunrise. “Tell me again,” Joy implored in quiet moments before sleep. “You know everything already.” “Not everything.” Not even close. Sometimes, Mama seemed like she wanted to forget. “Your father was a seaman.” He joined the war effort in WWII. After the conflict, he became undesirable to Great Britain. They threw him on a ship back to China. He tried to hide with friends, their few allies. Cooped away, he didn’t see the sun for months, turned pale, but not pale enough. They found him and broke the locks, smashed through metal and oak as if they were made from china. “We said goodbye–” “No. There wasn’t time.” 15. Joy met the boy at a dance. Jack’s eyes followed her around the dim hall, then he snaked through the crowd, leant close to whisper, “I like your hair.” Long strands that floated almost to her waist. He brushed his fingers through them, right down to the tips. It made the top of her head tingle. They slipped outside, alone. Under the bright moonlight, he kissed her forehead, then fluttered his lips down until she could taste his beer on her tongue. 16. Her periods stopped. They were never regular; she didn’t notice for months, until it was too late. 17. The baby boy was taken, gifted to someone else, gone in no time at all. They hadn’t wanted her to hold him, but one nurse had been kind. Her baby had a light fluff of hair the colour of malt and smelled of summer. She counted only twenty-eight seconds with him, but her mother said she had clung on for hours; wailing, shaking, sobbing. 18. At eighteen Joy entered a secretarial college. She felt a new woman. Her mother was very proud; patched up her clothes into new ones, healing ripped holes. Felix apprenticed to become a car mechanic. He came home smelling of petrol and grease. Felix wanted to marry a girl who’d taken her very grand car with a wonky tyre to see him. Her family damned the prospect immediately. He did not look the right sort. What would their children look like? They asked, again and again. That was all that mattered, in the end. Still, Felix dressed up to meet them, waited by the front gate. They never opened their door. After hours, he left the bunch of bluebells on the doorstep and looked up at the girl, sitting at the second-floor window, her palms on the hard, unwieldy glass pane. Felix moped, not facing work for days. So fortunate his manager was understanding – the kind man was married for decades to his English wife whose family never spoke to either of them again after her decision to spend life with a non-white man. 19. Joy wondered about her son. 20. And dreamed about him. Each time she began to wake, felt him dissipating, she clamped her eyelids shut, beseeching: please, just a few more seconds, a few more seconds. 21. Joy completed her course. All too easy. She found work at a shipping company. All the men leered, jeering and whistling after her. “Lass, where are you shipped from?” She left after the second month. There was more work right away; her lightning fingers on typewriters impressed. She learned specialist vocabulary, became medical secretary, this time for a consultant doctor at a London clinic. Joy took the train into the city first, then found her own room and moved away from home. Her mother couldn’t stem the tears as Joy packed and sealed her boxes. At work, the other girls stared at first, but unlike school, they said nothing. That was neither worse nor better. After a few weeks of eating alone in the small third-floor kitchen, another secretary, Marilyn, sat down beside her at the little round table. Marilyn placed a spoon beside Joy, who’d been struggling to scoop yoghurt into her mouth with a fork. Cutlery was a dear expense. More than six decades later, Joy would rest next to the spoon, ready for mealtimes in her next lives. She always hoped that there would be yoghurt there, ones with copious gooey fruit. 22. The clinic staff liked her. Joy was promoted to assistant office manager. She belonged, for the first time. Though many days were hectic and time passed with less and less pain, she wondered about her son, the wonderings a constant murmuration that tailed her everywhere. 23. Marilyn cajoled her to see the new nightclub. “Why so reluctant?” “I’m tired.” “It’s Saturday. You just told me you slept all day.” “Not all day, it’s only three in the afternoon now.” “Then that’s plenty time to get ready, isn’t it.” “Fine,” Joy mumbled. “All right.” There was another boy, but he didn’t stare. Timmy talked to her, asked her all sorts of questions, beyond ones about her face and hair. “Can I see you again?” Timmy asked. “I guess so.” They went to more clubs and bars, sipped afternoon tea, ambled the canals holding hands, and even spent money at a movie theatre. They met each other’s mothers, who were polite. The two women shook hands. Joy saw his mother’s gaze toss from her to her mother, lingering too long on their hair and eyes. She took the pen from Joy’s mother to sign as witness to the marriage, staring at the pen too, as if not quite believing her eyeballs. Joy and Timmy saved and saved. They bought a house. They slept pressed up into each other. She never told him that he was not her first touches. 24. Marilyn lived with a man too, someone five years younger than her and married, though not to Marilyn, which was all it took for them to release her from the clinic. “Well, fuck it, fuck it all,” Marilyn said on her last day. Marilyn cut her hair into a bob with a sharp, straight fringe, and took Joy to get her locks lopped off too. “It’s 1963! We’re the last to do it.” Marilyn gave Joy a miniskirt and a belt to style. Joy liked the look of her legs and the feel of the warm sunshine on her bare skin. Her husband did not like and accused her. Timmy imagined her flaunting her nakedness, lording her legs about, opening them for other men, having their babies. She thought about her son, but said nothing. He would no longer have been a baby at all. She smiled at the thought – a look misinterpreted as insolence. She didn’t see the hit coming, the sharp crack caught her left eye. She wore an eyepatch to work the next morning. 25. Joy slipped the key into the lock, turned gingerly, then nudged the door. The hinge squealed. Bloody ungrateful thing! It still whinged even though she’d wasted precious vegetable oil on soothing it. A light flicked on. Too sudden and bright. She blinked. “Do you know what time it is.” Of course she did. “Then what do you think you’re doing?” His low voice felt like a scream. Fire flared through her all of a sudden. “I can do whatever the fuck I want.” “Oh, yeah? That what you tell them all? Those wanker gits.” He grabbed her arms, lifted her and swung. “You fuck them how you want.” Her skull knocked back into the wall, the bong echoed in her head. She blinked away gold static. The neighbours whacked the walls. Purple and blue marks surfaced all over her body. Joy wore her miniskirt the next day and the next, not caring who saw. She trimmed her own hair in the bathroom mirror, tough strands falling to the floor like coils of black rope. Timmy accused her every few days, convinced of her manifold liaisons. No one escaped the heat of his distorting magnifying glass: her office manager, her consultant, the other doctors, the new nurse, a much too cheerful neighbour far down the street. All his own fabrications. He ripped her skirts anyway. A push propelled her into the blocked up fireplace. A bump rose from her scalp as if she was attempting to grow another head. 26. She thought about her son. She’d been told his new family lived in the capital. That was all she knew. At least he’s closer now. 27. Joy packed whilst Timmy was out at his important office. Marilyn brought a laundry bag and helped her pick out her life from his, bustling around the crowded two rooms. How did they have so much crap? They were always trying to save. Joy heaved the mattress aside for her savings. Thank Gaia he hadn’t found them, tucked into a corner with her contraceptive pills. She’d not wanted another pregnancy. She loved her clinic too much and didn’t know if she’d be allowed back. Joy slept like a new-born on Marilyn’s sagging, faded blue sofa. Her marriage was thirty-six and a half months old when it stopped existing. 28. After months recuperating with Marilyn, Joy found her own room in Lambeth. Alone again, she discovered many things. The annual lecture at the Royal College of Physicians was a great treat. She chose a seat next to a smart woman who introduced herself as a doctor. Joy’s eyes widened. “You could be too,” the doctor said. Really? Maybe. “Clever girl. I saw the book you were reading before. And you’re taking notes.” Maybe Joy could be like her. Marilyn believed it. The doctors at her clinic were encouraging. Her consultant convinced management to allow her to experience work as a care assistant, first part, then full-time. What a fantastic rush to be on her feet and not her bum all day. Her consultant went further, strode in one Wednesday, slapped the leaflets down. She startled, speechless at the writing: adult night classes. Wasn’t it too late? One way to find out. She selected A-levels in sciences and mathematics. Everything was difficult, but not impossible – another comforting discovery. 32. The acceptance letter from St Guy’s medical school was succinct. She stuck it on her wall and later took it with her, along with the spoon. 35. Joy worked harder than she’d ever done – long hours, evenings and weekends. But somehow the ground was softer, gentler on her soles. She paced everywhere with a light bounce. She had no time for anything else, though she thought of her son often. Was he working or still studying, at a university too perhaps. 37. Her brother visited with his wife and their two children. They went to a history museum, wandered about, stared at old belongings dug up and dusted for display. The older child, a girl, put her nose close to one case of old clothing and asked, “Will they dig up our things one day and put them in there too?” “I do hope so,” Joy replied. “For how long?” “I don’t know.” 39. A new blow-dry and extra high platform shoes for the day. Joy graduated, class of 1978 – one of the few women in her class, and by far the oldest. She started training and chose a specialism – internal medicine. On her first day the receptionist pointed her the wrong way, twice. “Aren’t you Miss Cheung? Domestic services are expecting–” “No. I’m a junior doctor. Doctor Owen.” The receptionist’s mouth dropped open. 41. A doctor kept appearing at the same time as her in the canteen. Any tiredness lifted as soon as she heard his voice. She looked about at lunchtimes, lingering too long at the drinks counter, feigning lascivious interest in the juice carton selection. Too eager, she knew, but she couldn’t keep her eyes from snapping to him as soon as she clocked him nearing. She’d developed some kind of advanced human radar for him. Derrick was seven years older and married to someone almost seven years younger than her. 42. Joy bought a house, just outside a London zone. She moved Mama and her stepfather to live near her. Joy hired a nurse, a friend from the hospital, to care for her stepfather through his last days. Against the better grumblings of her gut, Joy invited Derrick to eat something traditional she had seen in a magazine and wanted to try out on the cooker she almost never turned on. She bought a wok and pretended it had been used before. Within minutes she set off the fire alarm. She stepped on a chair, fanned at it with an old journal. The doorbell rang. She hurried off. He cleared his throat and handed her the red wine bottle. “It’s a highly sensitive device,” she joked, “a bit like its owner.” Shaky sounds, trembling laughter escaped her vocal chords. “You can’t be an expert at everything,” he said, eyes crinkling at the edges. He stayed for the night. They adopted a stray cat together. Or rather the feline adopted them, coming and going according to her own timetable. They named her Taiping, after a sassy princess Derrick had read about in a history magazine article about ancient Chinese dynasties. 43. The University of London approached her to teach part-time. She was extra elated to see girls studying. She prepared with three times the number of hours as the actual classes. All that time! “Why all that effort? You could be doing your own research,” Derrick said. Because she loved them, she told him, they were all like her children. He asked whether she had ever wanted her own. Why did she cry? She hadn’t realised. Then the tears flooded and dripped down her chin. Derrick unlocked a dam she’d held up so well on her own. She told him about her son. He said she could look for him. Her pulse quickened. She felt too hot. Could she? Is she allowed? Why not? Times have changed, Derrick said, more assured of it than her. But records had not been well kept. Hours were lost to calling, ploughing old archives. All hopes hit dead-ends. He un-fisted her hands. She fisted them again, then pushed them up to her forehead. She should never have let others take charge, she should have asked more questions, demanded more time, to think, to believe, to plan the possibilities. “He had blue eyes,” she said, then remembered that all babies have blue eyes. Part-way through their search Joy discovered she was pregnant. A baby girl arrived early, eager for life – healthy, strong and curious. They called her Daisy. 44. Derrick’s wife found out. None of them had considered this outcome. “It’s been belly-up in the water for years,” Derrick had told Joy. “Every second with her is like treading water.” The divorce was loud and acrid. Surprising. The woman had seemed unruffled at first, rather gracious and accepting. Joy had crossed paths with her before. They frequented the same supermarket, buying the complete opposite of groceries. One day Joy had seen her by the cucumbers, looking at a particularly floppy one. Joy froze, eyes widening. Then the tension scarpered somewhere. She had a soft moment, walked over and was about to point out the weird cucumber when the woman snatched it, whirled around and swung out at Joy’s head. Instinctively Joy snatched up a celery and hit back; their vegetables thwapped against each other, pieces broke off and bounced across the floor. “Hey, ladies, hey there,” a shop assistant bellowed, marching over. “Hate to interrupt the fun, but I must inform you my manager says: you must pay for any broken produce.” Daisy, strapped in the trolley’s front seat, clapped her hands, burbled and giggled. At least someone had been amused. Derrick moved in with Joy, her mother and the baby. He had so much stuff. So much stuff. More than even the baby. Joy gawped at strange things no one could possibly need. Like decorative plates and mug-warmers. Since when did mugs need jumpers? One even had sleeves, four of them. Bizarre. She had to make room for him, and time. But he filled an empty pocket within her that she didn’t know existed, slotted in like a new organ she never thought she needed. 45. Her mother, at first shocked to be a grandmother again, took to it very well, cooed and doted on Daisy. “Shall we get married then?” Derrick asked one Sunday morning, hands around a mug dressed in a colourful, striped wool outfit that day. “What on earth for?” “To make it official,” he replied. “For the world to see.” “I think the world can see from her,” Joy retorted, nodding at Daisy. “Anyway, you don’t have signed divorce papers yet. We’d be committing bigamy, and that’s been illegal for ten years.” Derrick never brought it up again. He took time away from the hospital, under the appalled looks of other consultants. Paternity leave was not fashionable yet. Derrick was a pioneering man, well ahead of his time. He’d missed the first days and years of his other children, who’d grown up too quick. He wanted to make the most of his time with Daisy, his last baby. Derrick had decided to get his wires snipped. 46. And an even greater gift to Joy – he looked for her son whilst she worked – an excavation project for the amateur historian. He started with her mother’s name – Adeline Owen. 47. They argued about petty things. Who didn’t? Derrick moved out and back in, out and back again. Sometimes he took Daisy. That was the worst. 48. One afternoon her mother lost her way home from the newsagents a few streets away. Another day she drove the family car to the middle of the common and left it with the doors and boot open. Home hours later, she told them there was a car-boot sale but couldn’t say where. They found the car two weeks later with half a bird’s nest in the back seat. The magpie was very annoyed. Joy took her to a GP, then a specialist, who advised on how to rearrange their lives better. 50. Joy finished work early and went home to a special birthday dinner. Daisy pulled the popper strings and cheered Joy’s half century. At the dining table her mother uttered, wistful, “Ohhh-yang, what a beautiful lad.” Joy thought she was talking about the electrician who’d fixed the porch light the week before. But his name had been An-Kwang. Daisy was sure. “Oohhh-yang. A good-looking lad. Fit. So fit. Gorgeous.” Her mother repeated the assertions several times a week, then with increasing frequency until he was almost a constant part of the home, like someone they knew and might appear at any moment. Who was this person? Joy finally asked when her mother seemed clear enough and ready one day. “Why, your father.” Father. Her father’s name was Ou-yang, anglicised to the name Owen that her mother used for life after her own family disowned her. “What was your surname?” Her mother did not remember. She had long ago stopped caring to. 52. Joy searched for him, for her mother, before she lost him forever. This was an even harder search. Who cared to keep records of those thrown out? But an opportunity emerged. Joy was invited to a Beijing medical conference. Daisy joined and was the most excited. She listened, rapt, to her mother’s lectures, proud of her on stage. Even better, Daisy had dreamed of seeing pandas ever since school classes on endangered species. They found nothing on Joy’s father and went home. Her mother was not surprised. Joy sighed, lying down on the sofa, relenting to jet-lag and disappointment. Another search extinguished. Her mother stroked her hair; she never wanted any pain for her, just simple joy. “Tell me, Mama.” Joy’s father had been in a strike for fair wages, for all races, asking to be paid more than just a third of the Englishman’s salary. This made him a troublemaker, more than he had been already. 55. Joy was made Head of Department as well as visiting professor at a New York university. She took time to adjust. 56. Derrick moved out again without offering coherent reasons. Joy lit a bonfire with all his things. It was early November, after all. Daisy was distraught, though tried to hide it. Joy took her for a bicycle ride around the park to cheer her up. Daisy sped ahead then stopped next to a pond, gazing down. When Joy reached her she saw that Daisy was watching the fish swim. The fish were patterned with orange and black splotches like they’d been splattered with paint. They swayed in gentle curves around each other, their tails wavering. “Where do they swim to?” “Nowhere, darling.” “Not anywhere else, ever?” “No, only in circles around their pond.” “Forever? Aren’t they bored?” “It’s their home.” “So, they never leave their home. Their families.” “No.” “Those little ones.” Joy looked where Daisy pointed. “Their daddies never leave them.” 57. After some months Derrick emailed from somewhere in Scandinavia. He flew home. No more questions were asked. They married in Marilyn’s back garden. 60. Daisy gained acceptance to medical school – everyone was jubilant, beyond proud. Joy bought her a pair of stethoscopes, her first ones. Her husband cried. Daisy hugged him. “Daddy don’t ugly cry,” she said, laughing. 62. Joy thought of her father. 63. And her son. Did he have sons himself? 66. Daisy returned from university fizzing with excitement about new websites, ways to poke and thumbs up with 2D fingers, and type words on online walls. They should be quick, Daisy said, Grandma’s running out of time – she’s almost 86. They should find him, Ou-yang, before it was too late. Before time was all gone. 67. They wrote a message, made a video just thirty seconds long and posted it online with a few keywords: lost, family, wartime. People are nosy beings. Terrific thing! Within days the video had been shared a thousand times, racked up 100,000 views within the month. They went viral. A public health issue Joy never imagined she’d enjoy having. In China again, Joy and her family were invited on television. Joy learned Chinese and tried some words out for the cameras. The audience clapped and she grinned, thrilled at this achievement. The presenter spoke almost perfect English and Joy relaxed, feeling like she was home. They returned to England and waited. 68. Daisy became pregnant, half unexpected. Joy told her – don’t rush – she had time and choices. Daisy gave birth to a boy. They taught him first words – Ah-Po and Ah-Gong – Chinese words for Grandma and Grandpa. 69. The television studio emailed – they had found someone. He had answered all the questions right, revealing facts nobody else could know. They bought a plane ticket. Business class. Joy’s mother insisted on going to the airport. She was ready before all of them, dressed in a blue and yellow tea dress with butterfly sleeves, a pink peony from the garden pinned in her hair, her lips daubed in red, her cheeks dusted with a rose blush. Her best pearl necklace rested on her collar and the ring he had given her on her finger again. As soon as the crowd from the flight appeared in arrivals, her mother swooped up her arms like she was cheering an England goal at the world cup. She waved with such purpose, her eyes fixed steady, certain, on someone. But they had no idea who she was beckoning at. The crowd meandered closer, dispersing at the edges. Before Joy could stop her, her mother bent down under the steel barrier and ran towards him, the hems of her tea dress flapping. They stared, incredulous. How was she so nimble? He was unsteady on his feet, leaning on the handles, shoving along a trolley piled high with navy-blue suitcases. Joy’s mother threw her arms around him, they clung to one another, laughing and crying. When Joy walked to them, he turned to her and cupped his hands gently around her cheeks. A few strands of thin, grey hair were brushed over his head. His face was dotted with brown and beige sunspots like a scattering of beans. The lines on his cheeks deepened, lengthening when he laughed. “My Ou-yang, as handsome as I first saw him,” her mother said over and over on the car ride back home, not letting go of his hands. They spent many happy months together. Reinvigorated, Joy’s mother talked non-stop of wedding plans. Were they ever married before? No one knew. Records unkempt, again. Joy’s husband warned of the legal implications. Joy shushed him and his cynicisms. “What if he’s some old con?” They made him spit in a tube; the results proved they’d wasted a hundred quid. They hired a lawyer for his new visa. Things took bonkers time, logged every six minutes. Why six? Better be good luck. 70. Joy drove everyone to Brighton beach. They collected pretty pebbles and shells that rested, sleeping on the sand after long journeys across oceans. Her mother and father skipped and wobbled to the shore holding hands. They planned a wedding with friends from her mother’s sewing and book clubs. Organisation took longer than Joy’s own wedding had. They sent out announcements (not invites) to the family who were still alive and flabbergasted. Joy was her mother’s maid of honour. Daisy carried her son, the ringbearer, and a basket of daisies. Felix drove down with his family. Taiping watched from her carrier. Joy thought about her son. He would be married to someone lovely. Maybe she had more grandchildren. What did he think of her? A shiver shot down her spine. Did he ever? 71. Joy’s father taught her more Chinese and how to make dumplings. Hers turned out like lumpy old pillows. She listened to language tapes at work. She had not retired yet and never wanted to. Derrick moved out. But there was a knock on Christmas eve. He had a guilty yet accomplished look in his eyes. Derrick said he’d uncovered new leads online, called and sent emails. Joy pushed away anger. She wanted to know before her own time ran out. And things were getting close, even though every year her expectations kept lengthening. The letter-flap creaked. Christmas cards from friends and neighbours. One had nothing written on it except for a telephone number and address. Nearby. A familiar shiver careened through her and a cold sweat covered her back as she slid the card away into a bedside drawer. 72. Joy flipped through the patient’s chart. He might be one of her last. She was getting more tired these days after fewer hours. “What’s that you see there, doctor?” She could see he had little time left. The illness had reached his core. “Tell me honestly.” “I can’t say for certain, Mr…” “What would you do, if you knew all along, of what was left?” What if? What if you could see a life in a few pages of text. What then. 73. On her way home from hospital, she glimpsed a man loitering at the end of her street. She halted, pulse thumping her neck, feet industrial-glued to the pavement. The man turned as if looking her way, but was gone in seconds. Joy’s father died in 2012, aged 93. He rested beneath a headstone, words carved in stone: Beloved Father, Husband, Ah-Gong, and Great Ah-Gong. Great seaman. Joy’s mother died months later. She was buried next to her Ou-yang. 74. Joy visited a doctor, a woman who’d been her student. Joy mentioned fatigue, pains. They ran tests, found nothing. But something told her. Act. Now. It is time. 75. The dawn sun jolted Joy awake. She shot upright. This was the day. She’d been preparing for it. She found the card from her bedside and went alone. Her heart crashed in her chest, there was a ringing in her inner ear. She didn’t stop. She put her knuckles on the wood, so soft, did anyone hear? Someone did. Someone she recognised immediately, even through the haze of her tears. A complete, full-grown man. Their mannerisms so similar. Their smiles were mirrors. “Who’s there?” One by one, three children appeared behind him. They were a foot taller than her. For most of his life, her son had no idea. His adoptive mother explained with her last breaths. Joy was sad to have never met her, to have not thanked her. Her son’s father was alive. She thanked him. 76. Joy’s son called every evening, visited every weekend. He lived so near. They must have passed each other, they’d frequented the same restaurants and shops. They had the same favourite brand of chilli sauce. In the following years, they did everything they’d done already again, together. 77. She visited her parents, burned things to send to heaven. Flustered cemetery attendants told her to stop, so she went with paper items already burnt to ashes, scattered them, explaining what they’d been; usually money, but also other essentials like a microwave and the latest mobile phone models. 78. Joy’s colleagues comforted her. Her parents had both been exceptional, living way longer than the life expectancy of their birth year. Science increased time like something divine. Everyone had more time now. Joy worked on – new virtual consultations. She worked hard to give people the priceless, to increase their existences. 79. 1 August, 2018 Dear Dr Joy Ou-yang Owen, You came regarding persistent pain in your lower abdominal area. As discussed, I shall refer you for further testing at… 80. Lots of treatment, yet minimal improvement. Joy worked part-time, still teaching, still caring, still giving time. Could someone magic more time for her? 81. She was most sorry to her son. Sorry for her years of fear. He’d had the least from her. She wondered if he’d really forgiven her; didn’t he blame her for all that was gone? “Mama,” he said. “Everything is good, turned out for the best.” She could not work anymore and at last relented to retirement. With everyone locked down, Joy managed a complete family, the happiest bubble. 82. The doctor said she had months. The second doctor said, maybe a year and a half at most. The third, fourth and fifth opinions stated weeks. She did not seek a sixth. 83. Joy flipped through her own records – her history that had fleeted past. 84. She wished hard, wondering, how to endure, to go on. Like everybody else, despite wearing a watch, always keeping count, always knowing, she still wanted more. More words, more sentences, more stories. “Should I have?” “Everyone gets here their own way,” her nurse said. She looked into her eyes, smiling, positive. 85. Joy’s children hold her hands. Her grandchildren and husband are there too, a miracle. Love surrounds her. She does not fear her closing eyes. She remembers how she has strived, fought to become everything she ever dreamed of: good daughter, mother, wife, teacher, and doctor who added joy-filled time to countless."

          "headline": "Boohoo wins influential adviser’s support in battle with Mike Ashley",
          "bodyText": "Fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has won the support of an influential shareholder adviser in its battle to prevent Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley wresting control of the company. Boohoo on Monday published the recommendation of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that investors vote against Ashley and another associate joining its board at a meeting on 20 December. Ashley had sought to become chief executive of Boohoo but was blocked by the company from putting that proposal to shareholders. He now says he will “work collaboratively” with the boss Dan Finley if he wins a board post and convene a further meeting to oust Boohoo’s founder and executive vice-chair, Mahmud Kamani. Ashley has made Boohoo the latest in a long line of targets for his corporate empire. Ashley made his fortune with Sports Direct, but has expanded far beyond trainers and tracksuits through a long string of acquisitions of clothing retailers ranging from House of Fraser to Flannels and Evans Cycles under the London-listed Frasers Group. Boohoo has become a target after its value cratered by more than 90% from its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic. A surge of online shopping during lockdowns inflated a bubble in internet retailers, only for it to burst as spending moved back to the high street. Boohoo and other British rivals such as Asos have come under particular pressure from Chinese competitors led by Shein, who gained market share by supplying the latest trends more cheaply. The company has, meanwhile, hired security consultants after unauthorised surveillance devices were spotted near its head office and executives suspected they had been “routinely followed” in recent months. Police in Manchester, London and Kent are looking into the matter as first reported by the Times and he Sunday Times. Finley, the Boohoo chief executive, said: “I believe that the group is fundamentally undervalued. There is no doubt that there is enormous opportunity for the group and I am determined to get back to being a disruptive and industry-leading business.” Boohoo argues that Ashley is seeking to disrupt Boohoo’s turnaround efforts, “destabilising the company and acting only in its own commercial self-interest”. According to Boohoo, ISS said “Frasers has offered a superficial view of performance and no specific plans for change and the two Frasers candidates, Mike Ashley and Mike Lennon, have real conflicts of interest.” It concluded that changing Boohoo’s board was not warranted. Ashley’s Mash Holdings owns 28% of the shares in Boohoo, which was founded in Manchester in 2006 by Kamani. Boohoo defied Ashley last month by replacing former chief executive John Lyttle with Finley, who had led the Debenhams brand under Boohoo’s ownership. Ashley lost out to Boohoo when it bought the Debenhams brand in 2021 after the department store’s collapse. He has mounted his own campaign to persuade Boohoo shareholders to back him. In a letter to Boohoo investors he accused Kamani of being “egotistical” and said the board had left a “catastrophic mess” through “panic-driven mismanagement resulting in reckless decisions”. In a statement in response to the ISS report, Frasers said Ashley’s intention was to prevent any “fire-sale of assets”. A spokesperson for Ashley’s Frasers Group said: “Mr Ashley set out clearly in his letter of 8 December his determination to work on behalf of all Boohoo shareholders and support Dan Finley to deliver on the opportunities to turn around the fortunes of the group. “He has been very clear he would not want Debenhams sold or any fire-sale of assets and has put on record his commitment to transparency and shareholder consultation, something badly missing under the current board.” However, Frasers itself is under scrutiny from investors as it dropped from the FTSE 100 last week and issued a profit warning amid questions over multiple takeover moves including a failed effort to take control of the luxury brand Mulberry and the recent acquisitions of the German sports retailer SportScheck and struggling Norwegian sports chain XXL. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: “If Frasers wanted to reassure investors, after Thursday’s profit warning, that management aren’t being distracted by all the corporate [merger and acquisition] moves, it probably wasn’t a good idea to announce a bid for a loss-making Norwegian sports chain on Friday morning.”"

          "headline": "Cheese, nibbles and wine: the best Christmas hampers – tasted and tested by Felicity Cloake",
          "bodyText": "Festive hampers tend, like many things about Christmas, to be more exciting to receive (there’s always a faintly decadent Brideshead Revisited vibe about such wicker-clad bounty) than to consume (So. Much. Chutney!). For obvious practical reasons, many companies focus on preserves and packets of tea which, grateful as you are for the thought, may not be things you’d have chosen to line the back of the cupboard for years to come. However, the carefully chosen selection below – which, having spent a day tasting my way through, I can personally vouch for – is near guaranteed to bring genuine cheer from delivery to dispatch. Instead of the usual boring biscuits and tedious teabags, there’s stuff you actually want to consume over the holiday, from cheese to champagne. Because the spirit of Christmas is all well and good, but if you’re going to spend your hard-earned money, you want more than the thought to count. At a glance The feelgood one: Ukrainian Christmas hamper £174.99 at Experience Ukraine The vegan one: The Yuletide vegan hamper £165 at Fortnum &amp; Mason The cheesy one: Christmas cheeseboard £55 at Highland Fine Cheeses The traditional one: Ham and chutney pig board £94.95 at Emmett’s The cosy one: Christmas in a Box £30 at Ginger Bakers The fancy one: The Darcy £260 at Thackray Brown *** The best food hampers for Christmas 2024 *** The feelgood one Ukrainian Christmas hamper £174.99 at Experience Ukraine This hamper could equally be labelled “the beautiful one”, but I thought it being the work of small Ukrainian producers – and created in collaboration with food writer and activist Olia Hercules – more important than my pleasure in a hand-woven willow basket from Transcarpathia or the wonderfully thick hand-knitted woollen socks from the Carpathian mountains. The edible contents are similarly unusual: strikingly malty wildflower honey from the Kosiv region; a jar of zingy green herb salt that would be excellent on fish or vegetables; plump dried porcini that are a world away from the usual wizened dusty stalks; colourful wildflower herbal tea. Nothing is overtly festive, save for the fat prunes covered in dark chocolate and the small bottle of Dima’s vodka, but equally there’s nothing you’re likely to find anywhere else. Nothing in this hamper requires refrigeration or eating up immediately, and there’s very little in the way of plastic to dispose of. It’s not cheap but everything in there is handmade, organic and sustainable, and it feels like a very special gift for someone who appreciates traditional skills and wants to support their continuation. *** The vegan one The Yuletide vegan hamper £165 at Fortnum &amp; Mason Plant-based hampers can tend towards the unfestively sensible, so I love that this one contains a bottle of silky franciacorta sparkling wine, made with 100% chardonnay to the same method as champagne, but without the animal-based filters used in many French fizzes. There’s also a packet of “reindeer treat” carrot-shaped jelly sweets, another thing that’s often not suitable for vegans. There’s a surprisingly rich mushroom and paprika paté that makes a very satisfactory replacement for the chicken liver variety, a delicate elderberry and blackberry conserve that would be delicious with some (non-dairy) yoghurt, and a generous helping of festively spiced, cocoa-nib black tea that should be on everyone’s Christmas breakfast table, vegan or not. Plus of course, being Fortnums, once you’ve scoffed it all you’re left with a sturdy hand-woven hamper and several pleasing reusable tins and caddies rather than a load of disposable packing. That said, though there are lots of nice things to enjoy with the tea and coffee, I would have liked a savoury snack or two to go with the fizz. Vegans like nibbles too! *** The cheesy one Christmas cheeseboard £55 at Highland Fine Cheeses I can measure the 12 days of Christmas by the shrinking of our cheese board – so bountiful on the big day, reduced to mere rinds for soup by Epiphany – by which you may correctly guess that cheese plays a big part in our family festivities. Instead of grabbing whatever’s left at the supermarket, a cheese hamper is an opportunity to try something new while you have the leisure to enjoy it. What I particularly like about this selection from the north of Scotland is that you can choose your own trio from the small business’s range. (Despite the dubious name, I’d highly recommend the oozy washed-rind Minger as well as the piquant Strathdon Blue and the buttery Caboc.) Another nice touch is that instead of the usual oatcakes and chutney, the cheese is paired with a jar of savoury sriracha-like chilli jam, a half bottle of sticky, liquorice-sweet pedro ximénez sherry and a waxed paper-wrapped packet of Andalusian olive oil crackers with aniseed; the Auld Alliance gone south. There’s no Christmas branding; it arrives in a neat pink cardboard box with shredded paper, a recyclable ice pack and a bubble-wrap envelope, so there isn’t much packaging for which to find a home. The cheese will need to go somewhere cold, but remember to bring it to room temperature before serving if you’re ordering for yourself. Christmas cheese sorted with just one click. *** The traditional one Ham and chutney pig board £94.95 at Emmett’s A Christmas ham is a fine thing to have on the table – especially if it arrives ready-cooked with its own pig-shaped board and chutney. Emmett’s of Peasenhall produces its traditional cooked hams from free-range pigs down the road in Blythburgh and prepares them behind the shop in this lovely East Suffolk village. As the brand notes, only 3% of UK pigs are entirely free-range throughout their lives, so this makes it a real festive treat; 1.5kg of emphatically porky meat not only makes a handsome centrepiece on its dedicated board, but should also see you through Boxing Day and well beyond. The date and lime chutney, which is made for Emmett’s in Sri Lanka, is fresh and zingy and would also be great with cheese; in fact, the only wrinkle as far as I’m concerned is that the cardboard box comes lined with insulating polystyrene, which isn’t widely recycled domestically. The ham really is exceptional, though. *** The cosy one Christmas in a Box £30 at Ginger Bakers £34.50 at Yumbles I have very strong feelings about traditional Christmas baking – in short, I think many retailers are relying on the fact that everyone will buy mince pies regardless of how unpleasant they are and how many they end up throwing away. If you’re sick of half-raw pastry and sour, gritty mincemeat, dry fruitcake and Christmas pudding that feels like it’s phoning in the seasonal cheer, then I’d recommend treating yourself or your host to a present from Cumbria. Inside are four deep mince pies with a real citrus and brandy kick, a half-kilo slab of rich iced fruit cake made with Lyth valley damsons and a truly excellent two-Great-Taste-award-star-winning fig and orange Christmas pudding, which somehow manages to contain generous quantities of rum and Lake District whisky yet feel lighter than your average cannonball. This little lot is basically a day’s rations for me over the season, though the cake will keep for six months and the pudding a year if you’re more moderate in your consumption. The packaging, tastefully festive in buff and purple, is fairly compact, and mostly cardboard and paper, so easily recyclable. The classics, done properly. *** The fancy one The Darcy £260 at Thackray Brown £260 at Sir Gordon Bennett The Darcy is the dream date if you’re having a lovely romantic Christmas a deux (or solo – you’re worth it); while undeniably expensive, it contains everything you need – from soft cheese to sloe gin – to have a really, really good time without leaving the house. Unlike many hampers, this is all killer, no filler. Thackray Brown sources from small artisan British businesses – specific suppliers will vary according to availability – and the hampers come with a deck of cards giving information on each product, which could come in handy if you run out of conversation. To pick a mere handful of the 23-strong contents in the one I tested, the soft cheese was the superb Baron Bigod, the burnished golden pork pie from Leeson’s of Oakham and the oatcakes from Fife’s Your Piece Bakery, while the booze was a bottle of Sussex pinot noir from Charles Palmer, and the light, almost floral sloe gin came from the sadly shuttered Oxford Artisan Distillery, making it a very limited edition indeed. Fresh-cut items are wrapped in waxed paper, and the lot arrives in fully biodegradable and compostable mycelium packaging, so you can just chuck it out of the window after you’ve finished the wine (joke!). A luxurious treat. *** Felicity Cloake is an award-winning food writer, author of the Guardian’s long-running How to cook the perfect ... recipe column and author of seven books, including culinary travelogues, One More Croissant for the Road, a BBC Radio 4 book of the week, and Red Sauce Brown Sauce: A British Breakfast Odyssey.

Take care! – JK Volkswagen workers said the German carmaker’s management has one last chance to compromise on Monday – or risk strikes on a scale not previously seen by the company, as talks began in a bitter standoff over pay cuts and factory closures. VW staff downed tools at nine German sites which are under threat, while thousands of workers marched waving flags and blowing whistles to a square to listen to union leaders in Wolfsburg, where the carmaker has its headquarters, Reuters reports. The latest negotiations come as Europe’s largest carmaker seeks ways to slash costs in Germany to better compete with cheaper Asian rivals that have entered its home market. Last week’s strikes at VW‘s four carmaking factories cost Volkswagen just under €40,000 euros a minute, a source close to the company told Reuters. Around 38,000 workers went on strike for four hours in Wolfsburg from the early and middle shifts alone, with the late and night shifts still to follow, the IG Metall union said. The strikes are already more widespread than the last round of major industrial action at VW in 2018, when more than 50,000 workers went on so-called “warning strikes” over pay at six sites. “Warning strikes” are flagged in advance and of limited duration. VW‘s management must signal their readiness to make bigger concessions on factors including their own pay and the dividend for unions to take forward negotiations this year, a source said. Union IG Metall chief negotiator Thorsten Gröger said Today, the workforce is taking a stand in the form of a nationwide warning strike. The New Year’s Eve fireworks will be followed by an escalation that this company has never experienced before. Gröger said management had “one last chance” to get back on track and find a solution this week or next. In the 1970s, a last-minute agreement over pay disputes was reached the night before strikes were due to begin. Omnicom is buying Interpublic Group in an all-share deal that will create the world’s largest advertising agency with combined annual revenue of almost $26bn. The New York City agencies have had a hand in iconic marketing campaigns like “Got Milk” for the California Milk Processor Board, “Priceless” for Mastercard, “Because I’m Worth It” for L’Oreal and “Think Different” for Apple. The combined company will be worth more than $30bn. Pizza Hut has been criticised for running a “dangerous” promotion that offered customers “free spins” at online casinos with their takeaway. Online pizza orders were accompanied by a message congratulating customers for having “unlocked up to 300 free spins at your favourite casino”. The message continued: “No deposit required! Claim your spins today!” Online casino games are associated with significantly higher rates of addiction than most other forms of gambling, according to multiple studies. The government recently acted to limit maximum stakes on such games to £5, or £2 for under-25s, a measure that will take effect next year. The Pizza Hut promotion drew fury from campaigners including the former leader of the Conservative party, Iain Duncan Smith, and Annie Ashton, whose husband, Luke, took his own life after battling a gambling addiction partly fuelled by “free” bets. Harrogate Spring Water, which is owned by the multinational Danone,is planning to cut down a wood planted by schoolchildren in order to expand its bottling factory in the North Yorkshire town. Two primary schools, along with other local volunteers, helped to plant 450 trees in a project organised by the Rotary Club of Harrogate almost 20 years ago. “They taught us that trees made oxygen and were good for us,” said Lily Stockburn who took part in the tree-planting when she was six years old. “I’m devastated they want to destroy it. To cut down trees to make more plastic bottles goes against everything we learned.” “It’s lovely woodland. Lots of people walk their dogs there, there’s loads of wildlife,” she added. Only the richest 10% of households can afford to buy an average-priced home in England, according to official figures laying bare the scale of Britain’s broken housing market. Highlighting the result of decades of house prices outstripping the growth in household incomes, the Office for National Statistics said the cost of buying a home was “unaffordable” in every part of the UK except Northern Ireland. It said it would take as many as 8.6 years of average annual household disposable income in England, of £35,000, to afford an average-priced home, worth £298,000 last year – almost double the ratio recorded in 1999. The equivalent ratios were 5.8 in Wales, 5.6 in Scotland and 5 in Northern Ireland, where the average property is only just considered within reach for most families. The ONS defines affordability as a local average house price costing less than five years local average income. On that basis it said only households with disposable incomes of at least £69,677 – placing them within the top 10% in England – could be considered reasonably able to afford an average-priced home in the country. In Wales, this applied to households in the top 30%, and in Scotland for the top 40%. Only in Northern Ireland was an average-priced home affordable for a household with an average income. In London, where house prices have rocketed most in the past two decades, even many households in the top 10% of local earners – with disposable incomes of at least £89,901 – would not be able to afford an average-priced property. An average home changed hands in the capital for about £530,000 last year, equivalent to 14.1 years of average income. For those in the top 10%, it would take 5.9 years to buy an average property, while it would take 34.7 years for those in the bottom tenth. Rachel Reeves said reopening the debate about joining the EU’s single market and customs union would not be good for the country or the economy. Reeves said the deal secured by Boris Johnson was not the best and that she wanted to do “practical things” to improve the trading relationship. But do we want to reopen a national conversation about our membership of the EU, single market and customs union? Do I think that would be good for us as a country, or indeed good for the economy? I don’t think so. I think those years of uncertainty [during the Brexit negotiations] were bad for the UK, both politically and indeed economically. At the meeting with the 20 finance ministers of the eurozone, she was expected to discuss the war in Ukraine, global trade and competitiveness. She rejected suggestions that greater closeness to the EU would risk the UK’s relationship with the US under incoming President Donald Trump. To try and pick a side I think would be very damaging to the UK economy, and we’re not going to do that. Rachel Reeves has said the UK will face greater barriers to future trade with the European Union, unless there is an improvement in the trading relationship, reports our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin. Since Brexit the EU has developed new regulations that will impose more costs and red tape on companies outside the bloc, such as carbon tariffs on imports known as a carbon-border adjustment mechanism, to new rules on recycling plastic packaging. Speaking to journalists ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers today, the first of its kind since Brexit, the chancellor said: I am not denying that there are barriers [to trade with the EU], and there will be greater barriers in the future, unless we improve our trading relationship with the European Union, which is exactly why I’m here. The Bank of England will be vigilant over the possibility that investors will take greater risks after a year of relative stability in markets, according to Dave Ramsden, deputy governor in charge of markets. Ramsden said in in the text of a speech at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank: I am also mindful that whilst this has been a year of relative stability, that is never a sign that we should get complacent. As famed economist Hyman Minsky once said, ‘stability breeds instability’ and the comparatively calmer market conditions of this year could lead to greater risk-taking in future. Down by the sea: poverty brings Blackpool life expectancy to UK low, writes our North of England editor Josh Halliday. It is a league table that no one wants to top. For the first time in 20 years, Blackpool, a once-glamorous seaside resort, this week overtook Glasgow to have the lowest average male life expectancy in the UK. Men born in Blackpool will now live until just after their 73rd birthday on average, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) study, six years less than the average in the rest of England. The figures highlighted an uncomfortable truism about modern life in Britain: wealth brings health and poverty kills, in what the ONS called a “clear” north-south divide. Those born in the wealthy Hampshire district of Hart tend to live a full decade longer than those in the poorest areas, while men born in the south-east of England will live three years longer on average than those in the north-east. Here is our full story on Boohoo: I’ve seen how declining British high streets can be brought back to vibrant life, writes Holly Lewis, co-founding partner at the research, urbanism and architecture practice We Made That, and town architect for London Borough of Hackney. If you have been reading anything about high streets recently, the chances are at least some of it included the reporting of another closure or collapse: M&amp;S and Boots shutting stores, banks closing branches, pubs withdrawing. The list is long, and perhaps we would be less concerned if we were all confident that one ailing business would be replaced with another, more dynamic one. But for many of our high streets, that is not the case. Against that gloomy backdrop, a report published at the end of November by the House of Lords’ built environment committee makes for refreshing reading, opening with evidence of “an optimistic and flourishing future” for our high streets. Nevertheless, the report is honest about the scale of the problem. High street vacancy remains a persistent challenge in too many town and city centres. Earlier this year, a government consultation on this issue cited 172,000 empty units across the UK, with 80% of those having been vacant for more than two years. Lebanon’s dollar-denominated bonds have rallied by more than 1%, after rebels in neighbouring Syria toppled president Bashar al-Assad – amid expectations this could weaken Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and bring political and economic stability. Lebanon’s 2029 bond gained the most, up 1.05 cents to 11.78 cents on the dollar, its highest level since December 2022, Reuters reported, citing Tradeweb data. Israel’s international bonds also rose slightly. Lebanese bond prices remain distressed, although the bonds have rallied at several points since Israel began bombing Lebanon, which investors attributed to hopes that a weakened Hezbollah could break political deadlock and enable progress toward sustainable fiscal policies. In Syria, rebels seized the capital Damascus in a lightning advance over the weekend and Assad fled to Russia following 13 years of civil war and five decades of dynastic rule. Analysts said this meant Iran had lost a key component of its arc of influence in the region, as well as its overland link with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hasnain Malik at Tellimer Research told Reuters: This undermines Hezbollah further, which, in the near term, means lower security risk for Israel and a potentially more market-friendly government in Lebanon,” said . Hezbollah has played a big part in the power struggle in Lebanon, which has had no head of state or a fully empowered cabinet since ex-president Michel Aoun’s term ended at the end of October 2022, with the country mired in one of the world’s worst economic crises . The latest events might force a weakened Hezbollah to play a more constructive role, said Tim Ash, senior sovereign strategist at RBC BlueBay Asset Management. New international focus on a wider Levant reconstruction effort will surely drag Lebanon along with Syrian coattails – assuming some stability and political reform in Syria itself. Jason Tuvey, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said: The fall of Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad has been warmly received by many, at least outside Russia and Iran, but a key lesson from the other Arab Spring countries is that hopes for a shift towards a liberal, Western-style democracy are likely to be dashed. The implications for the global economy and energy markets from events in Syria are likely to be limited, although these potentially represent another major shift in the geopolitical sands in the region. Oil prices have climbed by more than 1% after the fall of Bashar al Assad’s regime in Syria injected even greater uncertainty into Middle East politics. Brent crude futures have gained 78 cents to $71.90 a barrel while US crude futures rose by 87 cents to $68.07 a barrel. Spot gold, seen as a safe haven, rose by 1% to $2,657.35 an ounce earlier, and is now trading by 0.8% higher. Stock markets in Europe are mixed, with the FTSE 100 index rising by 19 points, or 0.2%, to 8,327, propelled by mining shares. Germany’s Dax and Italy’s FTSE MiB have both slipped by 0.2% while France’s CAC is 0.36% ahead. Mining groups, carmakers and luxury stocks LVMH and Richemont all gained after signs of fresh stimulus measures to shore up China’s slowing economy. Beijing will adopt a more proactive fiscal policy and moderately loose monetary policy next year and step up “unconventional” counter-cyclical adjustments, state media reported, citing a Politburo meeting. Saverio Berlinzani, analyst at ActivTrades, said: It seems that the Assad regime has fallen in favour of a new Islamic regime, which could change the geopolitical scenarios in the Middle East. Who is behind the jihadist rebels? Someone who wants the end of Russia, Assad’s historical ally? Trump, meanwhile, has already let it be known that aid to Kiev will decrease. It must be said that, even in such a fragmented context, the markets have held up well for now. The hope is that all this chaos on Europe’s doorstep can find a peaceful solution through international agreements. It is clear that the current change in Syria will bring changes to the geopolitical order of all countries in the area. The UK fast fashion retailer Boohoo, aimed at 16- to 30-year-olds, has won the support of an influential shareholder advisor in its battle to prevent Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley from taking over. This morning, Boohoo published the recommendation of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that investors vote against Ashley and another associate joining its board at a meeting on 20 December. Ashley would become chief executive under his plan. Ashley has made Boohoo as the latest in a long line of targets to become part of his corporate empire. He made his fortune with Sports Direct, but has expanded far beyond trainers and tracksuits through a long string of acquisitions of clothing retailers ranging from House of Fraser to Flannels. Boohoo has become a target as its value cratered by more than 90% from its peak during the coronavirus pandemic. A surge of online shopping during lockdowns inflated a bubble in internet retailers, only for it to burst as spending moved back to the high street. Boohoo and other British rivals such as Asos have come under particular pressure from Chinese competitors led by Shein, who gained market share by supplying the latest trends even faster, direct from factories. Boohoo argues that Ashley is seeking to disrupt Boohoo’s turnaround efforts, “destabilising the company and acting only in its own commercial self-interest”. According to Boohoo, ISS said that “Frasers has offered a superficial view of performance and no specific plans for change and the two Frasers candidates, Mike Ashley and Mike Lennon, have real conflicts of interest”. It concluded that changing Boohoo’s board was not warranted. Ashley’s Mash Holdings owns 28% of the shares in Boohoo, which was founded in Manchester in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani, who still serves as executive director. Boohoo last month defied Ashley by replacing former chief executive John Lyttle with Dan Finley, who had led the Debenhams brand under Boohoo’s ownership. Facebook cut more than 700 employees in the UK last year at a cost of £79m, after parent company Meta embarked on its first ever round of redundancies as part of a global cost-cutting drive to offset a disastrous collapse in revenues. The company – which is one of the most valuable US tech companies behind Apple, the Google owner Alphabet, and Amazon – also reduced its UK tax bill to just over 12% of its pre-tax profits, half the standard 25% corporation tax rate. Mark Zuckerberg slashed 11,000 jobs globally after admitting that Meta had overinvested at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the belief the increase in online activity would continue and accelerate even after Covid eased. The UK is lagging behind in the race to rewire the world’s power grids by investing four times more on renewable energy projects than on the electricity cables needed to connect them to the grid and consumers, according to a new report. For every pound the UK has spent on renewables it has spent only 25p on the cables and power lines, claims the report by Bloomberg NEF, which placed the UK eighth in an index of the world’s 10 biggest energy markets. The UK has trailed its European neighbours in Germany, Spain and Italy in constructing the electricity grids needed for a surge of projects due to its low ratio of grid investment to clean energy spending. It was also behind China, the US, Australia and Brazil in the global league table, but was rated ahead of India and Japan. Eurostar is the worst-performing rail service on the continent and Germany’s Deutsche Bahn is one of the least reliable, according to a ranking of 27 European operators. The report from the campaign group Transport and Environment (T&amp;E) scored Europe’s rail operators on factors such as ticket prices, punctuality and willingness to give refunds. It found that only 11 operators had punctuality rates above 80%. Eurostar disputed the findings. Deutsche Bahn declined to comment. Trains emit less planet-heating gas than planes and cars, but on many routes holidaymakers find it cheaper to fly and commuters find it more reliable to drive. Campaigners said the results showed that all rail operators could do better, and encouraged governments to help them. The number of job vacancies in November fell at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic, as business confidence slumped to its lowest level in almost two years, according to two new reports. In a damaging blow to the government efforts to boost growth, the latest monthly report on the job market from accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) found demand for staff declined at a “sharp and accelerated pace” last month, with the steepest fall in vacancies since August 2020. November marked the 13th successive month of a fall in staff demand, with an “especially severe” drop among vacancies for permanent workers, in the latest sign of a further deterioration in the UK labour market. Jon Holt, group chief executive at KPMG, said: Businesses are having to weigh up the prospect of increasing employee costs following the budget, which has led to an accelerated slowdown in hiring activity across the board. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, has looked at the Chinese inflation figures in more detail. The main reason for the slowdown was food prices, which fell -2.7% month-on-month to bring the year-on-year level to just 1.0%. Non-food inflation, on the other hand, managed to bounce back to 0.0% YoY after two months of year-on-year deflation. Non-food prices remain under pressure amid high price competition in China. What does this mean for central bank policy? She says: The unexpectedly weak November read further confirms our view that there is still plenty of room for monetary policy easing in the months ahead. Markets have been discussing the possibility of an imminent RRR [reserve requirement ratio] cut which is certainly on the table, but the inflation data shows that there is capacity to bundle an RRR cut with a further interest rate cut as well. We are expecting 30bp of rate cuts and 100bp of RRR cuts before the end of 2025. We are expecting inflation will remain low in 2025 but to avoid deflation at least in terms of headline CPI inflation thanks to an expected acceleration of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. While this is still the base case, November’s data does raise the possibility that we could see several months of negative year-on-year growth if food prices continue to come in softer than expected, as non-food prices continue to show deflationary pressure. Rachel Reeves is heading to Brussels for her first meeting with eurozone finance ministers today to reset ties with the EU. The chancellor will tell them that reducing the UK’s trade barriers with the European Union will improve the growth prospects for both. She plans to end the UK’s “fractious” post-Brexit accord with the EU, a relationship she said had been defined by “division and chaos”, by promising closer ties in the first speech by a UK chancellor to eurozone finance ministers since 2020. Reeves will say she wants to adopt a “business-like” approach through an “economic reset” with the EU, offering the goal of driving up trade and growth. Reeves will tell the meeting in Brussels: This is the first time a British chancellor has addressed the Eurogroup [of finance ministers] since Brexit. It is a signal of the new UK government’s commitment to resetting our country’s relationship with the European Union, and the importance I place in realising the economic potential of our shared future. “I know that the last few years have been fractious. Division and chaos defined the last government’s approach to Europe. It will not define ours. She will add: I believe that a closer economic relationship between the UK and the EU is not a zero-sum game. It’s about improving both our growth prospects. The reset in relations is about doing what is the best interests of our shared economies and those that depend on it. That means breaking down barriers to trade. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Financial markets are calm after the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where people are celebrating and a new era starts following five decades of dynastic rule. It comes after political turmoil in France and South Korea, and Asian shares are mixed. The South Korean stock market tumbled by 2.8% and the country’s currency fell to a 15-month low against the dollar amid uncertainty over the fate of president Yoon Suk Yeol, even though the authorities pledged to stabilise markets. He has been banned from leaving the country, as opposition politicians accused his party of staging a “second coup” by refusing to impeach him over his botched declaration of martial law last week. The opposition leader Lee Jae-myung warned that the political fallout is causing financial market volatility and threatens to damage the economy. Japan’s Nikkei index rose by 0.3% helped by an upward revision to economic growth and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.15% higher. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2% after China vowed to implement a more proactive fiscal policy and moderately loose monetary policy next year, the state news agency Xinhua reported, citing a Politburo meeting. The price of gold and crude oil has risen slightly. Brent crude futures climbed by 0.66% to $71.59 a barrel. Spot gold rose by 0.3% to $2,639 an ounce, as China’s central bank resumed gold purchases after a six-month hiatus. China’s consumer inflation hit a five-month low in November as prices for fresh food pulled back and factory deflation persisted, suggesting Beijing’s efforts to to shore up demand with fresh stimulus measures have not had much of an impact. China braces for new tariffs from the second Donald Trump presidency next year. The consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 0.2% last month, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, down from October’s 0.3% and less than the 0.5% forecast by analysts. Consumer prices fell by 0.6% in October from September, faster than October’s 0.3% monthly drop. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, edged higher to 0.3% from 0.2%, though. This week is packed with central bank meetings. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Canada (BoC), the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will announce their latest policy verdict throughout this week and all – except the RBA – are expected to lower their rates. The BoC is expected to cut by 50bp while the SNB and the ECB are expected to announce a 25bp cut. Some investors are convinced that the ECB could announce more than a 25bp cut. Either it could go bigger with a 50bp cut, or cut by 25bp but shift their focus from inflation to economic growth. I believe that the second option is more plausible. If that’s the case, we should not see a significant selloff in the euro post-decision. The Swiss central bank could also do a bigger 50bp cut, after it has been spending quite a bit to restrain the Swiss franc (its intervention to sell francs for euros is a reason why the euro is not testing parity against the US dollar). Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan, said: Incoming data support our call for global growth lift into year-end, despite a slipping euro area and building political stress. We expect policy rates in Canada, euro area and Sweden to drop to 2% or lower over the coming year, while US and UK rates settle close to 4%. This month’s meetings should point this direction.

          "bodyText": "As always, thanks for watching along with me, sequin-spangled community. Our awesome foursome now dance into the gala grand final. They will tackle not one, not two, but three full routines apiece in their bid to get their mitts on that gaudy glitterball trophy. It airs next Saturday at the earlier time of 6pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to raise our cyber scoring paddles and salute our new Strictly champion. Until then, for the penultimate time this series: keeeeep dancing! Thank you and a glittery goodnight. Finally, SparklingDormouse says: “My favourite dance by Tasha and Aljaz. Not too sickly sweet, just elegant and restrained. Very nice indeed!” joanieloves says: “Glad we got to see that waltz again. Aljaz is so good at this. Always remember the waltz with Abbey Clancy being fab too. Pete knows he’s going and is quite glad.” TeeDubyaBee adds: “Pete’s route now - the new Rylan. And good luck to him. Seems like a top fella.” LazyMillennial says: “Laughed my bottom off at Jowita taking the time out to reference the tentpole dance from Blackpool.” Dunntalkin says: “‘I didn’t want to do this in the first place, I did it because everyone else wanted me to’! Thank God Pete overcame his natural humbleness to grace us with his presence through the series.” MaineC says: “Lovely reaction from the Strictly team. Pete obviously a well liked man.” fihema adds: “What a great run he’s had. What a great season in general. And please, Santa baby, can I have a partner - a ‘special person’ - who treats me like Vito treats and speaks to Sarah? I promise I’ve been good.” JoMK73 says: “Adieu Pete! Did we all notice how studiously they avoided the old peck on the cheek? Was I the only one hoping for a big romantic reveal now that they’re done?” paperview says: “Probably of all the contestants this year, Pete is the one I’ve enjoyed most ‘meeting’ (and learning - yet again - never to judge a book by its cover).” diamondcat adds: “Well, we have the finalists that deserve it but I must give praise where praise is due and say that Pete really surpassed all my expectations. A complete non-dancer who has done so very well. All credit to Jowita who has been a great teacher for him.” Pancake01 says: “I think it’s a good mix for the final. All deserve to be there and offer something different. May the best dancer win!” Cumberken says: “I think Aljaz has looked off form this series and has been breathless after more exuberant dances, which detracts from Tasha . I actually liked Pete and Jowita’s dance better for that reason. But what do I know?” Pengolina123 adds: “I thought Pete’s big hug for Tasha was lovely.” A swift round-up of your semi-final results thoughts. Somersetlass says: “So entirely the right people are in the final - what a result! Have a fab week and I’ll see you back here on Saturday for what promises to be a spectacular final.” shazza2704 says: “What Chris and Dianne have achieved is truly groundbreaking. I hope the Beeb have a programme planned filled with outtakes, funny and serious, from their training sessions . It would be a ratings winner without a doubt.” TheMathDiva adds: “Right result tonight. Although Pete’s AT was very stylish, he was the worst dancer left by a long way and has been for many weeks. His dancing was clunky and clumsy. While I appreciate his journey, I want to see a final of fabulous dancing. Now we shall. If we are judging ‘the journey’, I think the glitterball should go to Chris. Certainly Dianne has had the hardest job teaching her celeb partner to dance. What a fabulous job she has done, all credit to her!” TV viewers can now flip to ITV1 for An Evening with Dua Lipa, to Channel 4 for Jamie Cooks Christmas or BBC Four for Judi Dench Night. At 9pm, it’s the I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV1 (Rev Richard Coles for the win), Wolf Hall: The Mirror &amp; The Light on BBC1 (Mark Ryalace for the win) or Alpine Hotel at Christmas on Channel 4. 10pm, darkly stylish six-part Italian crime drama Dostoevsky starts on Sky Atlantic. If you fancy a Sunday night film, tonight’s picks are Diamonds Are Forever (8.05pm on ITV4), Anchorman (9pm on E4), Bonnie &amp; Clyde (10pm on BBC Two) or Nightmare Alley (10pm on Channel 4). Stay classy, San Diego. So now we know our final quartet. To my mind, they’re the correct couples. Tasha Ghouri has been the contest’s pace-setter, even if recent public votes suggest she won’t win. Sarah Hadland has formed one of the most consistent and entertaining couples this year with Vito Coppola. JB Gill is hitting form at the right time and has overtaken Sarah to become the second highest scorer behind Tasha. Chris McCausland has been the feelgood story of the series and could well win. Perhaps you could argue that Montell Douglas or even Jamie Borthwick deserved a place but we’ve got four worthy finalists. It has all the makings of a cracking climax to the contest next Saturday. Pete’s exit means we also bid farewell to his pro partner, Polish pocket rocket Jowita Przystal. In only her third series, she did an astonishing job to steer Pete all the way to the semi-final. It’s testament to her teaching ability and the close bond they formed (complete with the obligatory showmance rumours in the tabloids). Jowita has an impressive Strictly record. In her debut series with a celebrity partner, she lifted the glitterball trophy with wildlife presenter Hamza Yassin. She suffered an early exit with Paralympian Jody Cundy last year but exceeded all expectations this time. It has surely established her as one of the premier female pros and put her in line for a promising partner in 2025. Just go easy on the cha-cha trousers in future, eh? She’s scored an incredible 22 perfect 10s across the series, including two of this year’s three maximum 40-pointers. She averages almost 37 points per dance. She’s topped the leaderboard more often than not. It frequently looks like Aljaž Škorjanec is dancing with a fellow professional, rather than a celebrity. However, Tasha Ghouri has been consigned to two consecutive dance-offs, suggesting she doesn’t have sufficient public support to win the glitterball. It’s a fate that’s been suffered by several spectacular hoofers over the years. The likes of Ashley Roberts, Danny Mac, Frankie Bridge and Alexandra Burke spring to mind. Seen as having too much prior dance experience and starting from too high a base, they lack what voting viewers truly adore: yep, a journey. It’s not just high scores which make a worthy champion. Tasha looks destined to be one of Strictly’s winners-that-never-was. Judge Anton du Beke came over all flustered last night when he goofed by referring to Pete Wicks’ Argentine tango as “your last dance of the series”. “Do you know something I don’t?” quipped Pete. An embarrassing gaffe by Tony Beak but it proved spot-on. The lionine Essex boy’s fanbase couldn’t save him this time. Dance justice was done at last. “In-for-a-penny Pete” has grafted hard, learned lots and improved steadily over the past three months. He’s discovered himself, falling in love with dance along the way - the textbook Strictly journey™ - but that only gets you so far. At some point, you need to deliver a breakthrough number. Pete never truly did. He found himself at the bottom of the leaderboard five times in six weeks but was repeatedly saved by the public vote. Happily, Strictly viewers are a canny bunch with a firm sense of fairness. They tend to know when enough is enough and eventually make the right decision. Maybe Pete didn’t deserve to outlast the likes of Jamie Borthwick, Montell Douglas and Wynne Evans. He definitely didn’t deserve to deny one of his fellow semi-finalists a spot in the grand final. As soon as votes dried up and the red spotlight shone down, he was doomed. Tasha Ghouri averages nearly 10 points per dance more than the otter-haired bad boy from Harlow. His highlights included swinging in on a vine for his George Of The Jungle samba, his 50s-styled quickstep, his Joker waltz on Halloween and his heartfelt contemporary Couple’s Choice. Not forgetting, of course, that Blackpool hen do cha-cha in pink PVC trousers which left little to the imagination. Pete was in his element when he could play a character, embrace it and throw himself in. He certainly didn’t merit the online trolling he’s received in recent weeks for eliminating superior dancers. Pete can’t help it if he’s popular, even if he’d begun to look sheepish and shocked with each escape. Elimination was ultimately merciful. He loved rescue dogs, his mum and his nan - an endearing combination. His dry, deadpan wit was also welcome amid all the glitterball gushing. The heavily tattooed TOWIE alumnus arguably should’ve gone in November but he’s done his career no harm at all with this extra primetime exposure. As Pete said with admirable honesty, he’s been on TV for a decade but never felt this vulnerable or lacking in confidence. Try telling that to the Tower Ballroom audience, Pete. Their eyes are still watering. As Team Petita take one last turn around the floor to You’re My Best Friend by Queen, the credits roll and their castmates gather around for damp-eyed hugs. Pete’s mum looks on proudly from the studio audience. Nice that she’s there for his final dance. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Well, obliquely, anyway. His pro partner Jowita Przystal returns the compliment, saying: “Thank you for the trust you have given me since day one. I know it wasn’t easy but with your hard work, your commitment and your heart, which is the most amazing thing, you were winning every week. “For me, every dance was special - even the cha cha in Blackpool! Remember on day one you said ‘I’m not going to stay long in this competition because I cannot dance’ but now I can say to you, yes you can.” He can indeed. In his exit speech, a choked-up Pete Wicks tells Tess: “It’s been wild. I’ve been quite honest about the fact that I didn’t necessarily want to do Strictly in the first place but everyone else wanted me to do it - and I am so glad that I did! You don’t always have to be the best but if you enjoy something then why shouldn’t you have a go at it? I’ve tried my best from day one, I said I was in for a penny, in for a pound and I’ve done it, it’s been beautiful. “There’s a lot of things I’m going to take away from this, but one of the most special things is Jowita. You’re one of the most incredible people - not just as a dancer but as a person. You’ve been a ray of sunshine for me. You’ve helped me through things in the past three months that I didn’t think I could do and you made me believe in myself and that means more to me than anything.” Well said, sir. Her casting vote isn’t needed - she’s only needed it twice this series - but Twirly Shirley, the Queen of Latin, says she would have voted the same. There we have it. The majority vote means that Pete Wicks and Jowita Przystal become the 11th duo to depart the Strictly 2024 dancefloor, while Tasha Ghouri and her pro partner Aljaž Škorjanec go through to the final. Tasha and Aljaž, saying “an incredible semi-final, Pete’s development has been joyous but for technical quality”. Tasha and Aljaž too. Tasha and Aljaž, saying “loved Pete’s showbiz splashiness but I’m going for quality”. Tasha’s got this in the sparkly bag, surely? But let’s hear from the famous foursome who will decide on our fourth and last finalist. Craig gave Tasha three points more than Pete last night and Motsi two points more. However, Anton and Shirley saw just a one-point difference, so you never know. Pete Wicks and his dance partner Jowita Przystal now reprise their Argentine tango to Bittersweet Symphony by The Verve. The squabbling judges said last night that it lacked Argentine tango technique and was more of a showdance but it was full of feeling, on time and, in Motsi’s words, “hawt”. It scored 33 points, seven fewer than Tasha’s waltz, so Pete is seriously up against it to close that gap. He needs to show considerable if not miraculous improvement. Tasha Ghouri and her pro partner Aljaž Škorjanec have another go at their waltz to (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin. The judges said last night that it had sensational flow and perfect natural turns with two bodies moving as one. Craig memorably concluded “sick”, while Motsi wants to give it more than a 10. It scored a perfect 40, seven points more than Pete, so maintain the standard and you’d imagine Tasha will sail safely through to the final. JB and Lauren will dance to a Motown medley for their showdance next Saturday. Can. Not. Wait. More balcony bantz with the newly minted Strictly finalists. JB Gill and Lauren Oakley got a fright but they’re thrilled. Shout-out to Amy Dowden who put all those “fundamentals” in place. It shouldn’t be a surprise but somehow it still is. Pete Wicks and Jowita Przystal are in the dreaded dance-off for the first time. Rightly so. He scored his first perfect 40 last night and topped the semi-final scoreboard, only dropping one point across two dances, so thoroughly deserves this. It truly is a “Mewwy Cwistmas” to all devotees of Harry Hill’s TV Burp. Which means… That pesky crimson spotlight is back to reveal who’ll face Tasha in the climactic dance-off this year. Will it be JB or Pete? Claud cues up a judgely highlights montage. Shining twins! Auntie Joan! Shirley’s tiny shoes! Slay, slay, slay! Craig Revel Horwood’s best bit was the sambathon because he was in control. Shirley Ballas looks back fondly on Blackpool. Anton du Beke ventures that this year’s cast is the best they’ve ever had. Even Paul Merson “gave it the full biffta”. The judges look back on their highlights of the series. Motsi Mabuse hails Dr Punam Krishan doing Strictly’s first Bollywood dance. For the last time this year, the judges perch onto Claudia’s banquette of badinage for a closer look at last night’s routines. Frugging their way in to a spot by Bye Bye Bye by N-Sync. Evocative. Got to love Raye, right? Well, that was a showstopper. Lovely to see Luba getting so much airtime tonight. Second musical act of the night now. Brit and Grammy-award winner Raye takes to the stage with her track Genesis Pt III. It’a a seven-minute, state-of-the-nation song divided into three acts, often known to fans as Let There Be Light. This is the song’s climactic section with jazzy, big band instrumentation. If you’re enjoying it, Raye will return to the ballroom for next Saturday’s final. Classy choreographic accompaniment comes Kai Widdrington and Luba Mushtuk. Sarah Hadland’s pro partner Vito Coppola is amusingly deadpan about his third final in a row. Claudia gets emotional about his and Sarah’s sweet bond. “You get good risotto and can sniff his shoes every day,” says Claud. The dream. Dianne teases next week’s showdance, which will be soundtracked by You Get What You Give by New Radicals. Total banger. Up in the Clauditorium, the two happy couples who are safely through to the final chat with La Winkle. An emotional Chris McCausland reflects on lasting 10 weeks longer than he predicted. He thanks the public for “getting on-board with what we’re doing” and says Strictly is the scariest thing he’s ever done. She’s clearly not been getting viewer votes these past two weeks. Tasha Ghouri falls from second on the leaderboard into the bottom two, meaning she’ll dance for survival with pro partner Aljaž Škorjanec for the second weekend in a row. Jubilation and not a little emotion from the comedian’s dance partner Dianne Buswell. The fan favourites are going all the way. The Miranda actor and her pro-partner Vito Coppola make it through. That’s three finals on the trot for Vito. They’ve been one of the most consistent couples in the contest and the third highest scorers overall, so the right result. The dreaded scarlet spotlight is having one last hurrah. Time to find out who’s a Strictly 2024 finalist and who must dance again for their spot. Another email just in from regular reader, Iain Crofts in Montreal. He writes: If my favourite participant in this series, Sarah Hadland, ends up in the dance-off, I do urge her to choose the tango and not the jive. The befringed trousers were definitely not jive-friendly. This will matter if she faces someone other than Pete. It won’t really be a shock if he is spared the dance-off by his fans having their commitment to him boosted by Shirley’s “Mr Strictly” remark as much a by Anton’s “last dance” slip of the tongue. Musical interlude now as Becky Hill - who first found fame on spinny-chaired contest The Voice UK - belts out her powerful single Indestructible. This slow-build rave-pop banger is produced by pioneering drum and bass DJ Andy C, whose signatures are fast mixing across three turntables at once and the “double drop”, where he lines up two tunes so their heaviest basslines drop at the same time. I feel old just typing that. Choreographic accompaniment comes the Strictly pros, including an all-female couple of Luba Mushtuk and Katya Jones. Fabulous to see. Our five semi-finalists nervously await the verdict in last night’s finery. Do their outfits provide a clue about what they’ll dance again if need be? Last night’s highlights are rewound on-screen. Two perfect 40s! Judgely squabbles! Disco trousers! Spectacular lifts! Cheeky Charlestons! Paul Hollywood handshakes! That’s enough exclamation marks! Or is it? Yes it is! Here come our co-hosts, so time for our regular couture clash. Tess Daly is in a white suit with a cape. Claudia Winkleman is in black satin. Claud wins, making it a clean sweep for Lord Claud this weekend. Cue clap-along credits. This is the penultimate time we’ll see these familiar faces, cheeky moves and cheesy grins. Will you miss them? Turn on the tree lights, crack open the Quality Street early and take your sofa seats. We’re about to be beamed back to the Elstree Studios ballroom… Because they performed two routines apiece last night, the dance-off pairings can choose to reprise their favourite routine of Saturday night for the eliminator. It should be a fairly easy choice for four of them, who all scored more for their second dance. However, Sarah Hadland scored 36 points for both her tango and her jive, so it might be a tougher call if she’s in the bottom two. Just five minutes to wait now… Cannibal cormorants? Shudder. The penultimate episode of Sir David Attenborough’s Asia just drawing to a close on BBC1 now. This instalment follows the wildlife of the continent’s arid deserts and dry grasslands, including the Gobi bear - one of the rarest beasts on Earth. It’s the ursine equivalent of a 10 from Craig. It’s a mere 10 minutes until glittery go-time… This series might have less than a week to run (sob) but we can also look forward to the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special, which will see six celebrities sleighing their way to the Elstree Studios ballroom in a bid to be crowned Christmas Champion 2024. It airs at 3.55pm on Christmas Day on BBC One. No liveblog, I’m afraid, but we will launch a special Strictly page with an open comments thread, so our lovely community can share some seasonal sparkliness. See you there, I hope. I’ll be the one wearing sequin-spangled reindeer antlers. Fifteen minutes until the red spotlight of doom is switched on… Towards the business end of the contest, JLS member-turned-farmer JB Gill has raised his game and gone up a level. Last night, JB notched his third near-perfect 39-pointer in a row for his paso doble, followed by his first perfect 40 for his salsa. Surely that’s finalist form? It’s 20 minutes until curtain up… We’re being treated to not one but two musical turns in the ballroom tonight. Dance-popper Becky Hill and chart-topping phenomenon Raye both perform. Double dancing last night, double divas tonight. Strictly, you are spoiling us. It’s 25 minutes until sequin o’clock… They’re the two most sarky celebrities in the contest but the bottom two on the scoreboard will be praying for a miracle in the public vote. Chris McCausland in the dance-off would be a major shock, while Pete Wicks would surely be sent home, regardless of who he faced. Could we see one last shocker? Half an hour until we get our first clues… Strap in for the last results show of the series, Strictly fans. Nobody wants to miss out on the grand glitterball final but sadly one pair must. It’s a cruel ballroom business. Good evening and welcome to the week 12 results show of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I’m Michael, your virtual dance partner for semi-final decision time. Please watch along with me as we find out who’s foxtrotting straight through to the final and who’s doomed to face the last dreaded dance-off of the year. Last night, our five surviving pro-celebrity pairs tackled two full routines for the first time in their bid to make it to the showpiece final. JB Gill topped the standings after scoring a whopping 79 points out of a possible 80. Tasha Ghouri was in second spot, Sarah Hadland came third and Chris McCausland finished fourth. Pete Wicks was left propping up the rest. But will voting viewers agree? They haven’t in recent weeks. It’s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and lightly salted asides. So snuggle down on this wet ’n’ windy Sunday night and I’ll see you on the sofa. As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for glitter-encrusted chat. I’ll paso knee-walk down there whenever possible to see what you’re all saying and report it up top. It’s the highest-stakes results show of the series. One couple’s heart is about to be broken beneath the glitterball. Nearly time to staaaaaart dancing into the final! That concludes Saturday’s semi-final liveblog but please feel free to continue the ballroom badinage in the comments section below. Meet you back here tomorrow for this year’s last results show. It airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1, with musical guests Raye and Becky Hill. I’ll reboot the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I’m @michaelhogan on Twitter and @michaelhogan100 on Bluesky/Threads, so feel free to give me a sparkly wave. Thanks for watching along with me, as always. Hopefully see you tomorrow but in the meantime, as if you needed telling: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight and stay safe. Finally, Vicc says: “There is far too much emotional gubbins and family and so on in the VTs. I’m having to mute them all, regardless of contestant.” Dunntalkin says: “Oh that’s interesting from Chris. ‘When you start the show. they ask you for a list of songs you like.’ So it’s not the production team we should be slagging off for some of the ridiculously inappropriate songs that are selected for some of the dances?” Peter Gibbs adds: “Is Anton on that chaise longue trying to channel Jacob Rees-Mogg?” stolencar says of the Ts&amp;Cs reader: “WALLACE ! Oh that Wallace, the strange little plasticine bald one with the big mouth. Phew.” MartGray adds: “Wallace and Gromit? Only Dave Arch himself could make Claud more excited.” On Sarah Hadland, ACSD1 says: “Very good from Sarah, accompanied by suitable music. I’m sure the footwork was perfect but camerawork, lighting and initial smoke doesn’t allow constant scrutiny!” Helenhiwater says: “Do the judges mention all the contestants’ ages or just Sarah’s?” SparklingDormouse says: “Good from Sarah and Vito but not amazing. Don’t think the trousers helped. Not much in the way of kicks and flicks.” diamondcat says: “I feel exhausted just watching Sarah! I don’t know where she gets her energy from.” MaineC adds: “Jive not Sarah’s dance. Mind you the music is too frantic so not helping.” On Pete Wicks, SparklingDormouse says: “Pete smiling in the middle of a number! Dance suited him, as do tails. Annoyed I can’t see his feet enough cos of the length of Jowita’s dress.” JoMK73 says: “In fairness, I’d say well done Pete. He showed confidence for someone who finds it very difficult, and I was genuinely pleased at the end that he hadn’t made terrible mistakes. Good for him.” emasl2023 adds: “Over the weeks. I have become a Pete fan - despite the fact that I still feel like giving his hair a good wash. I know Shirley has gushed and gone over the top but Pete is what the show is about and what I think it has lost over the years. Remember when Chris Hollins won it despite being a pretty ordinary dancer? It was his commitment and enjoyment that got him through.” On Chris McCausland, LekisP says: “I love Chris and Dianne but that wasn’t a great Charleston, too much faffing about, and not enough content.” VelvetinaB says: “Loved the joke and the happy-go-lucky nature of the dance, but I think Chris was out of breath a lot (no wonder!). His timing is amazing and I still think he’s incredible.” Clarissaharlowe1 says: “I’ve been fairly ambivalent about Chris up to now but after that Charleston I want him to win!” irreverentnurse says: “Chris, fabulous, so light on your feet, good posture and tucked into your partner in hold.” EastofStratford adds: “Good for that Dianne, a reminder of how much longer, rockier and more exhausting Chris’s Strictly Journey has been compared to anyone else’s. What they have achieved as a couple has been extraordinaryhat she has achieved as a teacher is beyond belief.” On JB Gill, MarkRoche says: “Lots of drama and mood, but I’m not sure whether or not I liked that paso. JB and Lauren are such a dynamic pairing, though.” MikeMoonlight says: “Pure genius. JB has saved his ‘It’s My Birthday Tonight, Please don’t Vote Me Out’ card for the semi-final. We can only presume that Pete Wicks has lined up a ‘101-year-old D-Day Veteran Grandad Who’s Spending Christmas Volunteering At His Local Food Bank’ card for the occasion...” MartGray says: “Good Lord, that was outstanding from JB and Lauren. If they get to the final they should make this their repeat dance. It deserved the Horwood handshake.” Poppieshen says: |Nice hips from JB there! And that is what a salsa should be like, my friends.” fihema adds: “Gosh. JB was just a champion. That was so good, so watchable, fun, competent. I’ll have to give up a Sarah vote, I think. I really hope JB is in the final. He certainly deserves to. Another one who has ‘been on a journey’ - reasonably good to start with, mesmerising for the last few weeks.” Here’s a rapid-fire round-up of your comments. On Tasha Ghouri, YodaknowsAll says: “Loved Tasha’s salsa. Still not quite enough sass.” gliese says: “Go Tash, all bubble and glitz and gritty - loved it! Though her legs sometimes stray as they are, I dunno, too long?!” Somersetlass says: “Oh, that waltz was just beautiful. Tasha floated across the dancefloor, and the whole thing seemed effortless.” dancingbears adds: “Beautiful. The best dancer rarely wins Strictly, but Tasha is the best dancer and, even though Chris is my favourite, I hope she wins. Ballroom for me is all about elegance and class, and that lass has it in spades.” TV viewers can now stay tuned to BBC One for Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel, flip to BBC Two for Mariah Meets Rylan or go to ITV1 for gameshow revival You Bet!. At 9.30pm, it’s the penultimate episode of I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! on ITV1. Come on, Oti Mabuse! If you’re in a filmic frame of mind, tonight’s picks are Die Hard (9pm on Film4), Mermaids (9pm on ITVBe) or the brilliant Everything Everywhere All At Once (10.15pm on Channel 4). Yippee-ki-yay indeed. It’s the penultimate round of shiny envelope-opening this series. Here are this week’s gong-getters… Best dance: JB Gill’s salsa, with Tasha Ghouri’s waltz a very close second. Worst dance: Pete Wicks’ faltering foxtrot. Best music choice: From Basement Jaxx to Metallica is quite a range but Dave Arch’s band nailed them both. Worst music choice: The Verve, oddly, lacked verve. Best outfit: Both of Dianne Buswell’s were lovely – a rainbow playsuit and a grey swirly waltz frock. Honourable mentions for Lauren Oakley’s deep green paso frock and Tasha Ghouri’s burgundy velvety number. Worst outfit: What was going on with Carlos Gu in the Clauditorium? Like Miss Havisham had become entangled in my nan’s net curtains. Best VT: Chris McCausland’s mates visiting him in training and coming over all emotional. Worst VT: Too many nans and cute kids but the school gates mums were really overplayed. Best judges’ comment: Craig’s one-word verdict of “Sick” to Tasha and channelling Paul Hollywood to shake JB’s hand. Best Claudia quip: Her endearing over-excitement about Wallace and Gromit. After dropping just one point across dances, JB Gill sits at the summit of the semi-final scoreboard, with Tasha Ghouri in second spot and Sarah Hadland in third. Down the bottom is Pete Wicks with Chris McCausland just above. Could Pete pull off one of the biggest shocks in Strictly history by being voted into the final? Stranger things have happened. Although not many, admittedly. As Tess and Claud get in their traditional clinch and tell us to “Keeeeeep dancing!”, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. A reminder of the night’s routines on-screen now. Double dancing! Sore feet! Get that Epsom salts bath running! Claudia flings open the voting lines for the penultimate time this year and it all kicks right off. Which semi-final fillies are you voting for? Which clapped-out nags are you definitely not? Judges’ scores for Pete and Jowita: 7, 8, 9, 9 for a total of 33 points. Bottom of the scoreboard for the fifth time. Judges’ comments for Pete and Jowita: Craig says “lacked any Argentine tango technique, just step and lift, more of a showdance”. Motsi says “full of feeling, led well, on-time and hot”. Shirley says “no mistakes but I’m so excited for your mum, Argentine tango with a twist, went to town, your best yet”. Anton concludes “proud of you, stuck at it, kept going and trying, improved enormously on your last dance of the series”. Oops! “Who can say?” backtracks Anton. Seven from Craig and a random 10 from Shirley, do we reckon? Last dance now. Pete Wicks has been bottom of the leaderboard four times but still hasn’t faced the dreaded red light of the dance-off. Voting viewers clearly adore him and are paying no attention to the judges. He’s been getting criticism online but says he’s “just a bloke having a go at something”. “In-for-a-penny Pete” is best when he’s playing a character and can throw himself into the storytelling, so the expressive Argentine tango might just suit him. Pro partner Jowita Przystal thinks this might be Pete’s best dance yet. Full of passion and power, but he’s off the beat at times and balance wobbles. Dominant with clear intention, lots of accents and changes of rhythm. Sensuous with bodies in complete contact but he’s often standing stock still or walking around while Jowita flicks and pivots around him. Lots of drama, not enough dancing for me. Song: Bittersweet Symphony by The Verve. The 1997 Britpop classic, which samples The Last Time by the Rolling Stones, became the subject of a right dispute until five years ago, when Jagger and Richards agreed to return the royalties and songwriting credits to Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft. He called it a “kind, magnanimous and life-affirming” development. Judges’ scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 36 points. Same as her first dance. Mid-table. Is that enough? Judges’ comments for Sarah and Vito: Anton says “clean and accomplished but a little hard in the legs, so the timing slipped, nearly there but not quite”. Craig says “absolute rubbish, full of energy, stamina, excitement, and fantastic”. Motsi says “nice, tight and compact but a tiny bit hard”. Shirley concludes “got slightly ahead of the music but tricks, highlights, lifts, legs, lights, camera, action”. Just a sequence of words by Shirl there. Nines all round? After that controlled tango, Sarah Hadland can unleash her full-on dynamism and bounce for this one. However, she still needs to channel her energy and nail the technique. Spectacular white feathery trousers, like Liberace on Seasame Street. Or a disco Mr Tumnus. A fast and furious number, with lorryloads of kicks, flicks and rotation. Keeping it compact and precise, with no flailing or flapping limbs. Light and bright, up on the balls of feet, maybe lacking a little bounce and retraction in place but huge fun. A bit like those trousers. Song: I’m So Excited by The Pointer Sisters. The 80s dance-pop hit also soundtracked a semi-final jive by Debbie McGee and Giovanni Pernice in 2017, which scored 34 points. Sarah and Vito will hope to do better. Judges’ scores for Chris and Dianne: 9, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 36 points. His highest score yet. Totes emosh. Judges’ comments for Chris and Dianne: They’re both emotional. Shirley says “beautiful footwork and spatial awareness, seamless and stunning”. Anton says “super-duper, exemplary movement and timing, you’re an inspiration”. Craig says “my pen went down, magical, darling”. Motsi concludes “loved the atmosphere, smooth and covered the floor”. Nines? A 10 or two? A unique blend of heavy metal and classic ballroom for this Viennese. It could be a stunner if it works. Chris McCausland is a huge fan of the song, which is beautiful with a dark edge. He also loves his ballroom and relishes being in hold, so it’s all pretty promising. Floating and twirling across the floor with a strong frame. Romantic and rotational. Great partnering. Posture not perfect but pretty wonderful otherwise. Song: Nothing Else Matters by Metallica. Chris is a huge fan of the 1999 power ballad. It’s Metallica’s second appearance on Strictly after Billy Bailey performed a tango to Enter Sandman en route to the 2020 glitterball trophy. An omen? First perfect score for a salsa for six years, since Ashley Roberts and Pasha Kovalev in the 2018 final. Judges’ scores for JB and Lauren: 10, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 40 points. The second perfect score tonight, only the third of the series and the first for anyone other than Tasha. He’s top of the scoreboard, dropping only a single point across two dances. Judges’ comments for JB and Lauren: Craig says “come to daddy” and gives him a Paul Hollywood handshake. Motsi says “nice and tight, one of best Cuban motions I’ve ever seen”. Shirley says “every sinew of your body was in the groove”. Anton makes some noises and concludes “just brilliant, love it”. Could JB be about to get hi first 40? Let’s hope the birthday party isn’t pooped by a pesky dance-off. Having topped the leaderboard five times and been a point away from perfection for the past three dances, JB Gill certainly deserves a spot in the final. His samba was a stunner and he won the samba-thon a fortnight ago, so he’s letting loose those Latin hips again. A big, expressive, upbeat number. Tricks and lifts, with partner Lauren Oakley flipped upside down at one point. Colourful and rhythmic with spice and energy. Big smiles. Slo-mo back bends. Body rolls and ripples. Some wow-factor lifts and joyful party vibes. Hips and happiness galore. Song: Red Alert by Basement Jaxx. The electro duo’s Do Your Thing has soundtracked previous Strictly Charlestons, by Peter Andre and Bobby Brazier. This 1999 funky club favourite reached number five in the UK chart. Judges’ scores for Tasha and Aljaž: 10 (yay), 10, 10, 10 for a total of 40 points. Only the second perfect score of the series, both for Tasha. Dad weeping with pride in the audience. Judges’ comments for Tasha and Aljaž: Motsi says “wow, I want to score it higher than a 10”. Shirley says “on another level, sensational flow”. Anton says “perfect natural turns, two bodies moving as one”. Craig concludes “sick”. Another perfect 40 incoming? Storm Darragh has clearly reached Elstree. Tasha Ghouri and Aljaž Škorjanec have had a rollercoaster couple of weeks, going from this year’s first perfect 40 to the dance-off. They’ve notched 18 perfect 10s and topped the leaderboard seven times, so let’s hope last week’s surprise appearance in the bottom two hasn’t dented Tasha’s confidence. She said her Viennese waltz way back in week two is a dance that she holds dear, so she’s been looking forward to this one. This is the last ballroom dance they’ll learn from scratch, so Aljaž is keen to end on something special. Slow, smooth and beautiful. Romantic opening, then eventually into hold. Gliding elegantly around the floor, with lovely footwork providing rise and fall. One little falter, I though, but oozing class. Snow falls to finish. Swoon-inducing. Song: (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin. The Queen of Soul’s 1967 hit, composed and later recorded by Carole King, has soundtracked two Strictly waltzes before - by Jennifer Gibney and Tristan MacManus in 2014, and Alexandra Burke and Gorka Márquez in 2017. Judges’ scores for Pete and Jowita: 7, 8, 9 (really?), 8 for a total of 32 points. His highest ballroom score but bottom at the midway mark. Judges’ comments for Pete and Jowita: Anton says “my old teacher is in the audience tonight, impressive topline and posture, less impressed by what went on below the waterline, love the open work”. Craig says “lacked dynamic style, a bit robotic but a confident performance”. Motsi says “you’ve improved at your own pace, showed class and sparkle, be proud of yourself”. Shirley concludes “you’re what this show’s all about, you shone, grand job, you’re Mr Strictly”. Steady on, Shirl. Sevens and eights? Later will come the Latin fire of the Argentine tango. First it’s time for Pete Wicks to show us some ballroom class. If Sarah Hadland has statistically the weakest combo of semi-final dances, Pete has the strongest. Can he make that count? Dancing underwater, so let’s hope he doesn’t drown. He’s holding a cane throughout the routine, presumably aiming for Gene Kelly but actually rather reminiscent of Lucius Malfoy. He’s struggled with softness, heel leads and hold in the past, so the judges will be looking for improvement downstairs. Nice jazzy opening. A dollop of Hollywood glamour and decent topline but lacking glide across the floor. Hesitant steps and better out of hold than in it. Frame OK, feet not so much. Song: Beyond the Sea by Bobby Darin. The 1959 swing classic was used in the closing credits of Finding Nemo and has popped up on Strictly before. Ashley Taylor Dawson and Ola Jordan performed an American smooth to it in 2013. Judges’ scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 36 points. Second place as it stands. Judges’ comments for Sarah and Vito: Motsi says “there was no stopping you, sharpness and focus never flagged, power all the way, although a little bit of softness might have helped”. Shirley says “stayed flat well, lovely footwork and drive, neckline tight, did very well”. Anton says “got tense in your shoulders, otherwise top marks, brilliant with beautiful lines”. Craig concludes “loved it, full of fire, passion, purpose and intent, amazing”. Nines all round? Can actor Sarah Hadland help her pro partner Vito Coppola reach his third final in a row? Strictly history suggests that she’s got statistically the worst combo of semi-final dances. Gulp. Nobody tell her. She needs to rein in her trademark effervescent energy for this tango, keeping it controlled and horizontal. Sarah looking fiercely glamorous in a sapphire blue fringed frock. It’s intense, moody and theatrical, almost Argentine in places. Sharp moves, fast feet and changes of rhythm. Vito’s choreography is a creative blend of modern and traditional. Plenty of staccato action. All it’s lacking is a little passion. High kicks and head-snaps amid the red strobe lights. Strong finish. Superb. Song: Big Love by Fleetwood Mac. The rock-band’s 1987 banger, written by Lindsey Buckingham. When they do a live acoustic version, drops of blood can sometimes be seen on Buckingham’s guitar due to the intensity of his playing. Judges’ scores for Chris and Dianne: 7 (boo!), 8, 9, 9 for a total of 33 points. Bottom after three dances. Judges’ comments for Chris and Dianne: He gives Di a piggyback over to the judges – and gives Craig some lip to boot. Craig says “it wasn’t messy but slightly under-energised and hesitant but full of character and you had swivel”. Motsi says “swag and chill, great personality and rhythm, loved the funny gags”. Shirley says “perfectly synchronised, springs in your shoes, instinct for awareness, I can’t imagine how you do those lifts”. Anton concludes “extraordinary timing, phrasing is controlled, not perfect but pretty close”. Eights and nines ahoy? Chris McCausland never expected to make it past week three but here is, nine weeks later, in the semi-final. Could he struggle to learn two dances in a week? He’s always at ease with evocative vintage tunes and this Charleston has an old-style jazzy feel. Goofy opening section to set up the story. He’s dancing with Dianne Buswell in the clouds, floating in a hot air balloon, aiming high and proving anything is possible. Cute, kooky and comedic. His timing and musicality is always uncanny but how they’re nailing the side-by-side synchronisation is miraculous. Fast and furious, with bags of character. Lifts, kicks and tricks. Enough ankle action for Craig Swivel Horwood? Lacking a little bounce, perhaps, and stamina seemed to sag but certainly bringing the joy. Song: When You’re Smiling by The Blue Vipers of Brooklyn. The 1920s jazz standard, most famously recorded by Louis Armstrong, is the unofficial anthem of Leicester City FC. It’s normally a Strictly quickstep tune. Claudia Fragapane and Maisie Smith both quickstepped to it in previous series. This version is by the New York swing band. Judges’ scores for JB and Lauren: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points for the third week in a row. It’s his 38th birthday, so JB gets a singalong and a cake on the Clauditorium. An extra point might have been nice too. Judges’ comments for JB and Lauren: Motsi says “amazing, loved the momentum and strength, clean lines. you led well and delivered”. Shirley says “you brought everything to that and executed the risky cape work perfectly”. Anton says “I got emotional, beautiful, a constant pulse but you embodied the narrative, epic”. Craig concludes “need to point your foot, over-strode but full of content, powerful, dramatic, brilliant”. Another 39-pointer for JB, do we reckon? A classical tune and a starkly contrasting mood to his second dance, which will be a salsa. JB Gill hasn’t done a tango or an Argentine (why not, producers?) so this is the first time we’ve seen his serious side. Medieval-styled with castles and flames. Moody stalking to open. He’s powerful and masterful, swirling a green-lined cape. Moody, mysterious choreography. The paso requires plenty of technique, so he needs to keep the footwork, frame and posture on-point. Dramatic and intense. JB committing to the matadorial attitude with strong walks, imperious expressions and aggressive stamps. Enough Spanish line? Lacking a little resistance? Otherwise, wow. Wonderful. Song: Requiem for a Tower by Clint Mansell. This orchestral orchestral composition by Mansell - the Pop Will Eat Itself frontman turned film score composer - was originally titled Lux Aeterna and performed by the Kronos Quartet for the film Requiem For A Dream. Not Gregg Wallace, luckily. The claymation duo are this week’s VIP guests, reading out the voting smallprint. “The best thing that’s ever happened to me,” says Claudia. More cheese? Judges’ scores for Tasha and Aljaž: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Strong start but by no means unbeatable. Judges’ comments for Tasha and Aljaž: Shirley says “you came out with fire in your belly but transitions suffered”. Anton says “brilliant technical quality and expression but not quite seamless”. Craig says “dance in and out of every transition but the lifts were phenomenal”. Motsi concludes “insane beginning, loved the movement and power”. Nines all-round, do we reckon? A classic waltz later but first they’re unleashing the Latin party. Two starkly contrasting dances to showcase her versatility. Curly Tasha looking leggy in a fringed, embellished silver lilac dress. Some messin’ abaht on a platform with purple smoke to start, then into an all-action number. They’ve packed this routine with loads of steps and lifts but she needs to make it look free-spirited. High energy and fast-paced so it requires serious stamina. She’s keen to show the judges she’s worked on her groove. Body rolls and tricks. Hot and spicy. Fun and flirty. Lacking a little earthy hip action, maybe, but excellent lifts. Did they slightly fluff the last one? Otherwise spectacular. Song: Something New by Girls Aloud. The official Comic Relief single from 2012, it was performed by the group on Strictly’s own Wembley special (remember that? Echoey). Our first sight of the five semi-finalists. Relatively restrained on the fancy dress front but Tasha Ghouri’s got a curly perm for the occasion. A rare chance to see their legs as we welcome the paddle-raising panel. Motsi Mabuse is in a gorgeous green dress, Shirley Ballas in red. Festive. They bust out some disco moves to The Final Countdown. See what they did there? Here come our presenting duo, so time for the regular frockular face-off. Tess Daly is in a black-and-silver sparkly minidress. Claudia Winkleman is in a sequinned tuxedo. Claud wins. Tom! Nick! Punam! Other people we’d kinda forgotten existed! Roll moody monochrome VT to ratchet up the tension. Nobody wants to fall agonisingly short of the grand final. Squeaky bum time. Do some light limbering up exercise from your seated sofa position. We’re about to go live to the Elstree Studios ballroom… The Hit List on BBC1 now. Better or worse than Alan Carr’s Numberwang, do we reckon? Because it’s a Strictly special, I’m saying better. Just a couple of minutes to wait… News this week that Kai Widdrington won Strictly: It Takes Two’s annual Pro Challenge and earned himself a Guinness World Record in the process. Kai successfully performed 15 cha cha cha time steps in 30 seconds. Congrats, Kai. No, we don’t know why you didn’t get a partner this year either. It’s just five minutes until the clock strikes sequins… This series has been such a high standard that all our semi-finalists have been scored a perfect 10 at some point - yes, even Pete Wicks (from Shirley Ballas for his Couple’s Choice, of course). We saw our first 10s way back in week four (for Tasha Ghouri’s Charleston) but Craig Revel Horwood waited another six weeks to dust off his own maximum paddle. Gawd love him. Not long now, semi-final spectators… The line-up has been confirmed for the upcoming Strictly Live Tour, which kicks off on 17 January 2025. The seven celebrities taking part are Jamie Borthwick, Wynne Evans, JB Gill, Tasha Ghouri, Montell Douglas, Sarah Hadland and Shayne Ward. No Chris McCausland or Pete Wicks, sadly, but Motsi Mabuse will join the judging panel for the first time as compensation. Hold tight, it’s a mere 10 minutes until semi-final o’clock… There’s a nice mix of nine different dance styles among tonight’s 10 routines. Two salsas is the only overlap. We can also look forward to crowd-pleasers like a paso doble, a jive, a Charleston and, yes, an Argentine tango. Appetites whetted? It’s just 15 minutes until ballroom blast-off… Tick them off when you spot them on screen! Take a drink for each! End up stoving into the Christmas Bailey’s early! Here’s your 10-point spotter’s guide for this year’s penultimate live show… Claudia deliberately prompts one of Vito’s animal/food analogies or rambles about obscure steps Pete Wicks pretends to have never heard of his song or dance Craig is roundly booed for raising his “nine” paddle Dianne tells Chris she’s proud of him and he looks nonplussed Tess Daly’s frock has involves superfluous asymmetry or a strange neck detail Aljaž is thrilled that one of Tasha’s ballroom steps was appreciated by Anton Claudia ropes in token “young person” from the cast to plug Strictly’s social media channels The glitterball trophy is in the studio and greeted with audience “oohs” JB Gill mentions that he’s “looking forward to showing his serious side” in the paso doble Tess tells a post-dance couple “they’re on their feet!” It’s been a busy old week in the training rooms, with our couples dividing their time between rehearsing two routines. Most of them are wisely varying the pace with one slower ballroom dance and one Latin or speciality number. Sarah Hadland faces a challenge by taking on a tango and a jive. JB Gill will feel the heat with a paso doble and a salsa. It’s 20 minutes until glittery go-time… In last weekend’s musicals-themed quarter-final, we saw a dance-off shocker as pace-setter Tasha Ghouri was consigned to the dance-off for the first time. However, it was Montell Douglas and her pro partner Jojo Radebe who sadly departed the dancefloor. Miss them already. Who’s next for the sparkly scrapheap? It’s 25 minutes until the sparkly curtain comes up… According to bookies, Pete Wicks is favourite to bid farewell for the third week running, with the shortest odds he’s faced since the series began. JB Gill is second favourite, followed by Tasha Ghouri just behind. According to the betting, Chris McCausland and Sarah Hadland should be quietly confident of a place in the final, barring dance dis-ah-sters or public vote shockers. Will there be an upset? We’ll get our first clues in half-an-hour… One more live show, two more dances and you’re in the final. No pressure, everyone. Good evening and welcome to the semi-final weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I’m Michael, your cyber dance partner for tonight’s high-stakes live show. I’d love you to watch along with me as our five remaining couples bid to reach this year’s showpiece finale and get a shot at the fabled glitterball trophy. Yes, it’s do-or-dance time for the ballroom class of 2024. For the first time tonight, our pro-celebrity pairings tackle two full routines apiece, so it’s been a busy week in the training rooms. Will this extra challenge sort the waltzing wheat from the cha-cha-chaff? The judges have their last chance to influence proceedings this weekend. In next Saturday’s final, their scores will be for guidance only and it’s all down to the public vote. Feelgood favourite Chris McCausland and the consistent Sarah Hadland are surely shoo-ins for the grand final. As for the rest, it could be any two from three. Tasha Ghouri and JB Gill have survived a dance-off apiece, while Pete Wicks is by far the lowest scorer of the four semi-finalists. It’s showtime at 6.30pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and semi-sarky asides. So close the curtains against Storm Darragh, pour yourself a warming libation and I’ll see you on the sofa. As always, I’d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for dance discourse. I’ll flick and kick my way down there to see what you’re all saying and report some of your comments up top. Who will take a great leap towards the glitterball? Who will fall at the last hurdle? It’s nearly time to staaaaart double-dancing!"

          "headline": "US Food and Drug Administration moves to ban red food dye",
          "bodyText": "A red food dye that is ubiquitous in American drinks, snacks, candies and cereals may finally be banned by the federal government after years of concern that it has adverse health impacts, particularly upon children. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said that it could soon act to crack down upon the additive known as red 3, derived from petroleum and used to provide a cherry-red coloring to an array of foods. “With red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, told a US Senate health committee on Thursday. Red 3 is used in nearly 3,000 food products, according to a database by one environmental health group, including Pez, Betty Crocker’s products and Dubble Bubble chewing gum. Like other food dyes, it adds nothing of nutritional value and is used instead to add color to foods for marketing purposes. While the FDA said that this food dye, like other such approved additives, is safe to consume if done so correctly, red 3 has been found to be carcinogenic in animals and has been banned for use in cosmetics since 1990. Public health groups have also linked it to behavioral problems in children. Pressure is now building upon the FDA to ban the food dye, along with others that are routinely provided warning labels or are banned in the European Union – yet allowed freely in the US. Last year, California banned four food dyes, including red 3. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s pick to be the next health secretary during his second presidency, has linked such food dyes to cancer and has been critical of the FDA for allowing certain substances in foods. “There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” Frank Pallone, a Democrat who is a ranking member on the US House energy committee, wrote to the FDA about red 3 recently. “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.”"

          "headline": "Australia v India: second men’s cricket Test, day two – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s Geoff Lemon’s day two report from the Adelaide Oval: Well, that was quite the day. One that belonged to Travis Head, was seasoned by Mohammed Siraj, and ended with Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland defenestrating the Indian top order. This is now very much Australia’s Test to lose, but if Rishabh Pant and Nitish Kumar Reddy can bat for an hour or two tomorrow, India could at least make a game of it. And if that pair do bat for any length of time, it will be extremely entertaining. I’m on deck for the first session of play tomorrow, so please feel free to join me for all the action. 23rd over: India 128-5 (Pant 28, Nitish 15) There’s a delay before the 24th over while Nitish receives some treatment to his right thumb. Textbook late-in-the-day time-wasting. The over is to be bowled by Boland, who replaces Starc, and Pant takes him on first ball – lofting a drive over mid-off for four. That wasn’t perfectly timed, but struck well enough. He then has the awareness to rotate the strike next ball and relax at the non-striker’s end. From there he can see four slips, a gully, and a catching point waiting for Nitish, so Boland will be furious when he lands his delivery on middle and is worked easily into the leg-side for runs. Then Boland is too short and Nitish leaves. Now Carey calls for a helmet so he can come up to the stumps. This is to help Boland commit to a fuller length and keep the batter in his crease. It almost pays immediate dividends with the keeper whipping off the bails in a flash but to no avail. With the pressure building Nitish stands his ground and hoicks a boundary off an inside edge through square leg. 23rd over: India 117-5 (Pant 23, Nitish 9) Pant and then Nitish both do well to rotate the strike and deny Cummins any consistency. The latter has settled quickly after his nervous start, and he confirms his growing confidence with a textbook cover drive, down on one knee, sending the ball skating to the boundary along the Adelaide Oval carpet. “At the start of this blog I posed a question concerning my attendance tomorrow,” begins Eamonn Maloney. “Presumptuous of me to assume there’d be anything to see on the third day of a Test match.” 22nd over: India 110-5 (Pant 21, Nitish 4) Nitish is skittish, trying to apply the Pant approach, but without the execution. He almost offers a return catch to Starc, then he flails outside off and sends the ball scorching just out of reach of Labuschagne at third slip. Gervase Greene is back. “While I appreciate the earlier sentiments that day-night Tests feature too great a contrast in batting conditions,” he emails, “the simple fact remains that the ‘victim’ in this instance is winning the toss and batting first. I am not sure why the day-night difference is any greater a disparity than being sent in first on a green top, or having to bat last on a dustbowl. Without being overly provocative, I suggest the criticism comes from batter-centric critics, who surely have had enough say on the game’s rules for the last 500 years…?” 21st over: India 105-5 (Pant 20, Nitish 0) Perhaps a little overexcited, Cummins reviews a legside catch to Nitish’s first delivery. He was nowhere near it. Nonetheless, an excellent over from the Australian skipper. India still trail by 51 runs. Pat Cummins brings himself back on and he castles his opposing skipper! Absolutely beautiful delivery, just kissing the top of off stump. Rohit never looked comfortable and he trudges off with his side deep in the mire. 20th over: India 104-4 (Pant 19, Rohit 6) While Pant is having the time of his life out in the middle, Rohit is happy just to survive. Starc beats him early but the Australian loses his line and length thereafter and the Indian skipper even manages to pounce on some length to punch a confidence-boosting four through extra cover. 19th over: India 100-4 (Pant 19, Rohit 2) Ha! Pant comes again! Two steps to leg then a massive swipe to the offside – middled – and through the covers for four. Then the diving hook shot – conventional this time – a mirror of the earlier shot and through fine-leg for four more! Extraordinary creativity and execution. This is TikTok cricket. 18th over: India 90-4 (Pant 11, Rohit 2) Not a great start for Rohit, the regular opener strolling out at 9:30pm at night at number six and top-edging his first delivery into his helmet. His second ball is even worse, with Starc finding that inswining once more to pin the Indian skipper LBW… but it’s a no-ball! The second in a row. However, there was also a thick inside edge that would surely have been picked up on review, which will make Starc feel a little better. Another inswinging yorker is just about repelled late in the over. It’s hard to see this match lasting deep into day three, so if you have any emails you want to share, send them in now! Bosh! Mitchell Starc has not fired this evening… until now! Finally some swing for the big fast bowler, and he uses it to perfection, finding some late tail back into the stricken Gill who is beaten for pace and movement, and sees his middle stump exterminated. The trademark Starc wicket. Like a boxer punching through the guard and dislodging a tooth. India are four down and drowning. 17th over: India 86-3 (Gill 28, Pant 11) Boland beats a Pant prod at the start of the fifth over of his spell. Pant remains circumspect, prodding uncertainty at another… then he unfurls the most unhinged shot I might have ever seen. Technically I think it was a reverse hook, leaning back, and middled for four over the slip cordon. What on earth was that!? And then he puts his want back in its case for the remainder of the over. Unbelievable batting. 16th over: India 82-3 (Gill 28, Pant 7) Pant is more respectful to Starc, dotting a couple then dashing a single. Gill then plays away from his body, gets a very thick edge, that Smith gets his fingertips to diving full length to his right at second slip. That wasn’t a chance, but Smith’s athleticism almost turned it into one. It would have been meat and drink to a third slip. Gill then works a couple to the on-side before standing tall and punching through the off-side for two more. 15th over: India 73-3 (Gill 20, Pant 6) Pant comes in at five for India when Rohit might have walked out. And he comes out with intent! A couple of skips to leg and a mighty swipe over extra-cover for a one bounce four! Incredible scenes. He then almost runs himself out attempting a needless second but Webster (on as a sub) throws poorly from deep square leg and makes it hard for Carey to gather with Pant struggling to make his ground. Pant has clearly come out trying to replicate Head’s heroics, perhaps not the worst strategy. Kohli presents the full face of the blade to earn three runs down the ground from a perfectly serviceable Boland delivery. Then the Victorian golden arm gets his man! Hardly anything has troubled India this evening, but everything that has seems to have taken a wicket! Line and length from Boland, angling in, Kohli attempts a forward defensive but can only find a healthy edge through to Australia’s gloveman. Boland’s average dips back under 20. 14th over: India 62-2 (Gill 19, Kohli 8) Starc returns to the attack in place of Cummins. He immediately finds a better line and length, but there’s no venom, and both right-handers are able to keep the scoreboard moving with patient accumulation. Time for the final drinks break of the evening. 18 overs remaining in the day’s play. 13th over: India 58-2 (Gill 18, Kohli 5) Boland has been by far the pick of the home attack so far and he beats Gill’s outside edge at the start of his third over. Not a lot to report from the remainder of the set. A single brings India’s deficit down from three figures to two, still a long way behind in the match. 12th over: India 57-2 (Gill 17, Kohli 5) The sixth, and presumably final, over of Cummins’ opening spell passes with minimal incident. These are not the terrifying conditions we were promised. 11th over: India 56-2 (Gill 16, Kohli 5) Boland begins his second over by rapping Gill on the front pad and appealing with gusto. His entreaty is disregarded and no review is sought, presumably because of height. He then has Kohli either playing and missing a couple outside off, or deliberately playing inside the line. Either way, they were lovely seaming deliveries. Nathan Lyon is back on the field following his elbow injury. 10th over: India 55-2 (Gill 15, Kohli 5) You can sense that Cummins is trying to urge himself into form, running in with purpose and hitting the crease harder than previously this series. The result is lift from a length that hits the splice of Gill’s bat. India do well to rotate the strike then Cummins overpitches, allowing Gill to lean into an effortless cover drive for four. There’s still very little happening off the deck or through the air. India will be shaking their heads at being two down. 9th over: India 46-2 (Gill 7, Kohli 4) Scott Boland must be on the shortlist of cricketers in history with a golden arm. Despite being on the fringes of this Australian team his CV is already packed full of incredible moments. He almost adds to it later in the over too, beating Kohli’s outside edge first ball, then inducing a thick edge that beats gully and runs away for four. Scott Boland is invited to bowl, somewhat belatedly, and he strikes first ball. Classic Australian seamer line and length, right-arm over, angling across the left-hander, who nibbles behind. India have only played a couple of false shots but now they’re two down trailing by 115. 8th over: India 42-1 (Jaiswal 24, Gill 7) The pitch is doing very little, as you’d hope late on day two of a Test match in Adelaide, which puts all the onus on the bowler to make use of conditions through the air. So far, Australia have not extracted as much movement as might be expected. With both batters playing the ball late, there have been surprisingly few concerns. 7th over: India 38-1 (Jaiswal 21, Gill 6) As darkness begins to descend on Adelaide and the floodlights take full effect, Starc continues, hurling a couple of junk deliveries down the leg side. Then he overcorrects, offering width, that Jaiswal accepts gleefully with a Head-like swat that flies over the cordon for four. A fast inswinging yorker hints at a radar rediscovered, but Jaiswal is waiting for it and drills it straight for three more. Surely Boland gets the next over. 6th over: India 30-1 (Jaiswal 14, Gill 5) While Starc has looked unthreatening, Cummins appears to be bowling himself back into form, beating Jaiswal’s outside edge with a lovely slanting delivery. The youngster is unfazed though and to a similar delivery instead of coming forward, rocks back, and clips a cut straight into the ground in front of second slip that is too hot for Steve Smith’s parry and runs away for four. 5th over: India 24-1 (Jaiswal 9, Gill 4) Starc has lacked control so far, allowing Jaiswal to leave repeatedly outside off stump. After ignoring three deliveries the opener tries to uppercut the fourth, fails to connect, but the trampoline bounce still sees it fly over Carey and away for four byes. Starc then tries to place the ball on a spot, instead of hurling it there, and Jaiswal is waiting for it with the full face of his bat and the long off boundary is breached near instantly. Perhaps time for Scott Boland to make use of the new ball. 4th over: India 16-1 (Jaiswal 5, Gill 4) Gill is off the mark first ball with a handsome flick through midwicket with Cummins striving too hard for the full inswinging delivery. KL Rahul perishes! He looked composed at the crease but the first short ball of the night does for him. After four excellent deliveries either good or full, Cummins drops short, catches his foe unawares and Rahul is late onto a pull, managing only to edge an ungainly swipe that Carey takes down the legside. 3rd over: India 12-0 (Jaiswal 5, Rahul 7) Lovely cricket. Starc with a bit of swing into the right-handed Rahul, but the opener bides his time and caresses a gentle push in front of midwicket for a gorgeous boundary. That was the shot of a man in excellent form. A trio of singles keep the strike rotating with both batters showing excellent composure. India have started this testing session solidly. 2nd over: India 5-0 (Jaiswal 4, Rahul 1) There’s still plenty of blue sky around as Pat Cummins bowls onto KL Rahul’s hip and the Indian opener dashes through to get off the mark. The line and length to Jaiswal is much more threatening and the left-hander is relieved to survive a delivery that almost clips the shoulder of the bat and the top of off stump. The new pink ball has yet to misbehave. Nathan Lyon has not taken the field for Australia. It can be assumed that’s a consequence of the blow he took to his right elbow from Bumrah shortly after Tea. 1st over: India 4-0 (Jaiswal 4, Rahul 0) There is no repeat of the first innings with Starc hurling a rank opening delivery down the leg side. The second delivery is on the left-hander’s pads but he can’t cash in. Jaiswal’s guard has changed noticeably from the first innings, with his toes on leg stump, rather than middle, allowing him more room to play through the line against Starc bowling over the wicket and appearing less susceptible to the swinging delivery. And that adaptation pays dividends when he caresses a square drive from under his nose away for four. India survive the first of up to 31 overs this evening. Mitchell Starc is at the top of his mark. Yashasvi Jaiswal is on a pair… For India, Bumrah (4/61) was again the clear pick of the attack, despite being nowhere near his best and looking like he was struggling with a couple of niggling injuries. Siraj went wicketless for 21 overs but took the vital wicket of Head and then mopped up the tail for 4/98. Ashwin’s 1/53 included the phantom wicket of Marsh, and also demonstrated how uncomfortable Australia’s batters are against his box of tricks. In other Australian cricket news, Sam Konstas is 80* for NSW against WA in the Sheffield Shield. He will surely make a Test squad before the end of the summer. Australia have moved into the box seat today courtesy of Travis Head. His rapid 140 stands apart on a scorecard dominated by scratchy knocks and low numbers. Marnus Labuschagne hinted at a return to form, and Nathan McSweeney showed grit in tough conditions last night, but Head’s brilliance knocks everything else into a cocked hat. Australia will not be upset at having to bowl 30 or so overs with a new pink ball under lights. As is becoming commonplace in these day-night affairs, the match is moving on apace. Lyon digs out a full delivery that evades mid-on and runs away for three. Siraj then hits the top of off with a jaffa to end Australia’s Head-heavy innings. 87th over: Australia 334-9 (Lyon 1, Boland 0) Can Lyon keep out Bumrah? Ouch! Yes he can, but the first legal dot ball of the over crunches into the off-spinner’s right elbow. He refuses to flinch, but that looked painful. He escapes strike soon afterwards with a scampered single off a squirty inside edge. Boland then plays and misses twice outside off, but the line is too wide from Bumrah to a No.11. He tries to recalibrate but flings his final delivery of the over down the leg side. 86th over: Australia 332-9 (Lyon 0, Boland 0) Boland is beaten all ends up first ball but he doesn’t get a nick and survives. The same happens on the penultimate ball of the over. The innings change will be soon. ”I’m almost a bit surprised Cummins hasn’t declared,” emails Ross McGillivray. “Two hours with pink ball and this game could be almost over. Not sure half a day’s play tomorrow will thrill SA Cricket. No. I’m not a fan of night matches. The difference in conditions between day and night is too great.” I think they’ll have two hours Ross, even if it’s not by their own choosing. Starc is so eager to bowl in these conditions he gifts his wicket away to the first delivery after the interval! Routine line and length from Siraj and the big Australian just dollies some catching practice to mid-off. Two in two balls either side of the Tea break for India. Out walk Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Starc to take guard for the final session of the day. Mohammed Siraj, public enemy number one, has a pink ball just five overs old. The lights are on, but there’s still plenty of daylight. What do we have in store? “What are the odds for Virat Kohli back in the pavilion by stumps on day two?” ponders Krishnamoorthy. I’d say there’s every chance. There are still 37 overs left in the day. Australia’s tail is unlikely to last long after tea, and we know how good Starc and co are with the pink ball. Trust The Lovely Eggs to have a song for everything. I’ll be back shortly, but enjoy your tea break to the sound of Mohammed Siraj’s inner monologue. The wicket heralds the tea interval with Australia now in a very strong position thanks to Travis Head’s blistering hitting. Everything from here is gravy for the home side. Tail end runs will be accepted, but the opportunity to bowl at India under lights a very handy alternative. Cummins charges Bumrah and inside-edges for four just a whisker past his leg stump. Bumrah follows up by hitting the top of off. But the wicket-taking delivery is only just legal. India’s celebrations were put on hold for a couple of seconds as the third umpire confirmed some portion of the bowler’s foot was behind the crease. As expected, the new ball has accelerated this contest. 84th over: Australia 327-7 (Cummins 8, Starc 17) Starc long-handles the first delivery of Siraj’s new over and the ball flies off the edge for four through third. Then he straight drives for four more! Then lofts over cow for two! Superb lower-order smiting. The crowd absolutely loves it. “The send off from Bumrah was ignored in the last test and I would be willing to bet that the Siraj one will also be unpunished,” bemoans Stephen Lewis. I have mixed feelings about it. I don’t mind a little passion, and in this age of everyone knowing each other well through franchise cricket, a lot of the rivalries now feel manufactured. But mouthing off to a guy who’s almost single-handedly matched your teams’s score, with the game very clearly against you, is just mealy mouthed and dumb. Pick your moments. 83rd over: Australia 316-7 (Cummins 8, Starc 6) The crowd continues to get stuck into Siraj, who is now on the boundary rope, refusing to take a backward step. Bumrah then celebrappeals for an LBW against Cummins which is correctly declined for a massive inside-edge. It didn’t stop Rana charging in to remonstrate. Bumrah sticks to his task and ends the over with an absolute beauty! From wide on the crease he angles the ball into and through Cummins with serious pace and movement. The keeper and cordon go up as one, but the bowler isn’t super interested. Rohit calls for a review… Snicko quickly reveals there was no inside edge for a catch behind. Then ball tracker indicates LBW is out of the question too. It is simmering out there. India need some calm heads out there as we approach the evening break. “Jonathan, you speak an uncommon amount of sense,” emails my burner account Gervase Greene. “Adelaide Oval is exactly a massive oval that seems to have retained pretty much all of the charm of one that is not. The MCG, for example, is the opposite. When a great crowd of 50,000 is there it feels half-empty. That’s the difference. (And I am a member of the MCC!) 82nd over: Australia 315-7 (Cummins 8, Starc 5) The crowd has just seen replays of the send off and are now booing everything Siraj does – and erupting when Starc smears his first delivery through the covers for a handsome boundary. Nonetheless, the new ball does the trick, and Australia’s set batter will not be around for the most difficult spell of batting. But then again, there’s a risk India will rattle through the tail and bring forward their own pain by being forced to bat late in the day. Siraj shares the new ball, and he begins poorly, with the third delivery in five whipped off middle-and-leg by Head through midwicket for four. He doesn’t need gifts in this form, but the South Australian is getting them nonetheless. And with the bit between his teeth Head is able to pick a length delivery off middle over midwicket for six! Then he’s castled! Out of nowhere, Head plays across a full straight one and the zing bails light up in the gloaming. The crowd stands to salute a magnificent innings, one that has transformed this Test match. Siraj behaved like a massive wally in the aftermath of the dismissal, sending the batter on his way with some verbals and hand gestures. Read the room Mohammed. 81st over: Australia 300-6 (Head 130, Cummins 8) After receiving some attention to his groin region (can groin be pluralised? Is it a left groin and a right groin that becomes groins, or is it a general area of groinage?) Bumrah is back on his feet, much to the relief of Indian fans around the world. However, his comeback delivery is a tame half-volley on leg stump that Head whips dismissively for another four. “Hello Jonathan,” hi Pratik Bhide. “Writing from New Delhi and I’m feeling chilly at work in the afternoon, although that might also just be Travis Head and his habit of filleting our bowlers every time he faces them. There is nothing that incites sheer panic in me as an Indian cricket fan than Travis Head past 20 runs. My mother and I are watching the Test in seperate cities, and both of us are surely thinking of the nickname we fondly have for him in our household — Travis Dread. An outstanding batter that we always wish would slip, just once.” 80.3 over: Australia 291-6 (Head 121, Cummins 8) Here comes Bumrah with the shiny pink Kookaburra, coming out of shadow, through sunlight, and back into shadow again. Second ball he has Head fending at fresh air, making the ball curve away from the centurion from around the wicket. Is the hometown hero bothered? Nope. Next delivery is crunched over long-on for a sweetly-timed four. And now Bumrah is down. The physio is on. Looks like a right groin problem. He only bowled four overs in the first session, so maybe this is a niggle he brought into the match? 80th over: Australia 291-6 (Head 121, Cummins 8) Australia continue to nudge Ashwin away. Now, time for the new ball… “Adelaide Oval! Massive? I don’t think so Jonathan,” declares Ray Murphy “A quaint bespoke oval perhaps. Massive?” A capacity of 53,500 is massive. Only a handful of cricket grounds in the world are bigger. That fact we still see it as a bespoke oval is part of its brilliance. 79th over: Australia 291-6 (Head 121, Cummins 8) Nitish Kumar Reddy replaces Siraj, and he almost gets Cummins second ball! A length delivery induces the drive but the regulation edge only reaches Pant on the half-volley. Then Cummins thick-edges a cut that flies straight to where third slip would be… but there is only a second slip and a gully, so there’s no catch and four more to the scoreboard. This game is moving quickly again, and is surely about to explode with the new ball in a few minutes. 78th over: Australia 284-6 (Head 121, Cummins 1) Australia have now ground out a lead of 103 runs, which is a mighty number in the context of the match and Mitchell Starc’s form with the pink ball. That advantage only grows by two in an over demonstrating once again Australia’s respect for Ashwin. Jamie Bannister is on board with The Lovely Eggs. “Is this the first mention of Lancaster’s finest The Lovely Eggs on OBO? If so I am here for any Holly and David celebrating. For sports fans I recommend the catchy Baulk Cushion œuf course.” Maybe it’s only Ashwin this pair are concerned about? The runs flow against Siraj, including four to Head from a massive swoosh that flies off a thick outside edge. But then India’s number two paceman bags his first wicket in his 21st over! Nondescript back of a length delivery and Carey gets stuck on the crease wafting outside his off stump. Very soft dismissal, and one that has come at a dreadful time for the batters below him in the order. 77th over: Australia 282-6 (Head 120) 76th over: Australia 274-5 (Head 114, Carey 13) The new ball and floodlights are just around the corner, which may well have been a cautionary tale discussed over electrolytes. After throwing his bat at everything for an hour or so, Head decides to drop anchor against Ashwin. The calm before storm Bumrah. I forgot to say hello to everybody at the handover, here’s a more formal introduction. I’ll be with you until the close of play, so please send me your emails and keep me company. The address is jonathan.howcroft.casual@guardian.co.uk. Some things you might want to discuss: Is there a better massive sports stadium in the world than Adelaide Oval? With England finding form and major cracks emerging in Australia’s top order, could we finally be set for a competitive Ashes next summer? Are you familiar with The Lovely Eggs? 75th over: Australia 273-5 (Head 114, Carey 12) Australia deal in singles against Siraj with half the Adelaide Oval outfield shrouded in bubble-shaped shadows cast by the silhouette of the beautiful stands. Time for this partnership to enjoy a well-earned drink and figure out how to navigate the next hour of this middle session. 74th over: Australia 270-5 (Head 113, Carey 10) Thank you James, it’s a pleasure to share the tools with you. Back in Adelaide, Travis Head is in party mode. This innings has taken the game away from India and they need something special to fight their way back into the contest. 73rd over: Australia 267-5 (Head 112, Carey 8) Head in Excelsis! Three boundaries flayed off Rana, the ball crashing through and over the covers on repeat. This is fantastic to watch… and that’s exactly what I am going to do now as I pass the OBO tools on to Jonathan Howcroft. Thanks for your company, goodbye. A nudge into the leg-side off Ashwin sees Travis Head go to his eighth Test century and his third at the Adelaide Oval! The crowd rise to him as he removes his helmet and plonks it on his bat handle, raising both arms to the skies in scenes that Ridley Scott would be proud to choreograph. 72nd over: Australia 255-5 (Head 100, Carey 8) 71st over: Australia 252-5 (Head 98, Carey 7) Rana is pummelled for consecutive boundaries by Head! He’s on the cusp of a remarkable Test century! 70th over: Australia 243-5 (Head 89, Carey 7) Ashwin goes flat in the face of the flurry of runs. Try saying that after a tipple, or having been awake for 21 of the last 24 hours. Damage limitation, four runs off the over. 69th over: Australia 239-5 (Head 86, Carey 6) Harshit Rana replaces Bumrah after a flat spell from the Indian talisman. Head EDGES and the ball flies away between slip and the keeper! Gah. Pant and Rohit glare at each other like two tightwads at the bar, neither flinching as the ball bisects them and races to the boundary. Four more! Rana strays onto the hip and Head doesn’t miss out, he’s careering to a century. John Starbuck is feeling festive. “Jim, there ought to be the equivalent of Advent Calendars specially for a five-test series. What would you want to see when you open each day? Jasprit Bumrah in full flight?” Travis Head in full blitzkrieg mode is not bad for December 7th, John. 68th over: Australia 230-5 (Head 78, Carey 5) Travis Head is ticking! He smokes Ashwin down the ground for SIX! Next ball he tries a huge moose of a slog sweep that goes high in the air… Siraj circles underneath it but can’t cling on to the catch! How costly will that be? Head blocks out the last two balls after his rush of blood to the oh what word should I use here? 67th over: Australia 220-5 (Head 68, Carey 5) Bumrah goes short and Head takes him one, seeing it early and pulling in front of square for four. Head is winning the battle against Bumrah at the moment, Australia’s lead stretches to 40 runs. 66th over: Australia 210-5 (Head 62, Carey 2) Ashwin is looking dangerous now, spinning his web. Always at the batter. He traps Carey on the pad and there’s a loud appeal but it was sliding past leg stump. A probing maiden from the wily old spinner. 65th over: Australia 214-5 (Head 63, Carey 5) Bumrah nearly gets Head with a short ball that the batter decides to try and periscope away over the keeper at the final second. A smile rather than a stare from the bowler. 64th over: Australia 210-5 (Head 62, Carey 2) Replays show that Marsh may have even grazed his pad with his bat and not the ball. If he’d reviewed he may well have been reprieved… but he thought he hit it. Alex Carey is the new batter, he plinks his second ball to Rana at mid off where a misfield sees him scamper two to get off the mark. Ashwin strikes! On with the arm and Marsh pokes away from his eyeline, a thin edge is snaffled by Pant. Marsh seems to walk before double checking with the umpire, who duly raises the digit of doom. 63rd over: Australia 207-4 (Head 61, Marsh 9) Marsh stands tall and flashes a back foot drive off Bumrah to the point boundary. After my big upping intro it hasn’t quite happened yet for Bumrah in this spell. 62nd over: Australia 202-4 (Head 61, Marsh 5) Head cuts Ashwin for a single and Marsh drives down the ground for another. Ashwin tosses one up, as much as he ever does, Head’s eyes light up in response and he dances down to drive over cover. He doesn’t middle it though and picks up two runs rather than the intended boundary. 200 up for Australia. 61st over: Australia 198-4 (Head 58, Marsh 4) Travis Head has some eye, Bumrah bowls a length ball on a fourth stump line, Head moves inside it and cuts it late, right out of the screws, the ball tracing away across the Adelaide baize and thudding into the hoardings. Talk about timing and placement. Bumrah offers a shrug and a smile and pounds back to his mark. 1-0 to Head. 60th over: Australia 192-4 (Head 53, Marsh 3) Marsh tickles a single to get the scoring underway. Head clobbers a drive that the bowler does well to swoop and stop in his follow through. Righto, here comes a crucial passage in this match, maybe even this series. Am I over egging things? Perhaps. But not really. Jasprit Bumrah is coming on to bowl, fresh after a rest. Maybe a five or six over stint? Can he get rid of Head and get his side back into this match? Let’s find out. Here come the players for the second session of the day. Ashwin is going to start with the ball, Mitch Marsh on strike. Australia’s lead stands at eleven runs and counting. ICYMI: Gus Atkinson takes the 50th hat-trick in Test cricket. ‘When the chance comes, don’t miss it’ Stumps in Wellington. Another quiet day at the Bazball office… Head cuts Siraj away for four to go to another blistering fifty. That caps off a decent session for Australia, they lost McSweeney, Smith and Labuschagne but have knocked off the deficit and moved into the lead. Head is set and looking dangerous, another hour or so from him after the break and Australia will have a commanding first innings lead. Right0, dawn breaking here in London, time to get mainline some Kenco. 59th over: Australia 191-4 (Head 53, Marsh 2) 58th over: Australia 186-4 (Head 49, Marsh 1) There’s a long delay whilst India send a review for LBW to Marsh upstairs. The umpire said not out and the Big ol’ Bison was a heck of a long way down the wicket… it looks like he might have trapped it too? After many replays they decided to stick with the on field umpire and I think that is a fair decision. One more over before the interval. 57th over: Australia 185-4 (Head 49, Marsh 0) Siraj is called back into the attack but Head greets him with a Swiss clock timed clip off his pads for four through midwicket. The bowler does well to stem the flow with four dots on a length, Head makes room off the last, backing away and lashing to deep point for a couple more. We’ve got ten overs til the break, nigh on a hundred runs and three wickets in the session so far. 56th over: Australia 179-4 (Head 43, Marsh 0) Warning signs for India despite the wicket as Travis Head is positively purring. He launches Ashwin for another big SIX down the ground and takes eleven runs off the over to see Australia into the lead. Every run from now will hurt that bit more for Rohit and his men. 55th over: Australia 168-3 (Head 32, Marsh 0) Mitchell Marsh is the new batter and he blocks out the rest of the over from breakthrough man Nitish Kumar Reddy. Gone! Marnus Labuschagne cuts powerfully… but in the air to gully where Jaiswal takes a sharp catch! India celebrate with abandon and Marnus has to drag himself from the field, no narrative exploding century for him but he showed signs of getting back to something of his old self with that gutsy knock. 54th over: Australia 168-3 (Labuschagne 64, Head 32) Australia in the ascendancy now after losing McSweeney and Smith early on this afternoon. A couple collected off Ashwin with no alarms and no surprises. 53rd over: Australia 166-3 (Labuschagne 63, Head 31) Rana is hoicked from the attack by Rohit and Nitish Kumar Reddy is summoned. Head sits back and punches for two through the off side and follows up with a bludgeoning cut for three that is hauled in by the fielder on the fence. 52nd over: Australia 160-3 (Labuschagne 62, Head 26) And breathe. Calpol administered and Ashwin sends down a maiden. 51st over: Australia 160-3 (Labuschagne 62, Head 26) Carnage! Four boundaries in the over as Head and Labuschagne take Rana to task! Rana persists with short pitched bowling and is punished, pulled twice, cut once and glided for another. 17 runs off the over. Australia cut the deficit down to 20 runs and the partnership between this pair is 58 runs. 50th over: Australia 143-3 (Labuschagne 50, Head 21) A single off Ashwin poked through cover by Head. Meanwhile, the syringe search continues. 49th over: Australia 142-3 (Labuschagne 50, Head 20) “Surely under such circumstances they should be called Wisden teeth?” Jake Kimber-Thomson isn’t the first to chime in with this zinger. Come one, come all. FIFTY for Marnus Labuschagne, well batted. Takes some serious stones to come back from that Perth horror show. The toddler is awake by the way. With a cough to boot. Tis the season. Excuse me whilst I dig out some Calpol and search for one of those syringes. I may be some time… 48th over: Australia 138-3 (Labuschagne 47, Head 19) Ashwin is coming on for a bowl. He has a slip and short leg in place to Marnus. Slightly too full and allows Labuschagne to drive down the ground and get off strike. Head has one ball to take a look… and then launches his second down the ground for a towering SIX! Got the front dog outta the way and committed wholeheartedly to the stroke. Smeared for 93 metres. Ashwin nearly strikes back immediately with a flatter delivery into the pads, it was going down leg though. 47th over: Australia 131-3 (Labuschagne 46, Head 13) Rana is slightly too full and is picked off for a couple each by Head and Marnus. Rowan Sweeney has some teeth tales of his own: “Much solidarity with Thomas Bancroft. I have traumatic memories of having my wisdom teeth removed in 2009. Owing to my teeth having curly roots, two of them needed to be cut into quarters. To make it worse the dentist was heading to the Perth Test, hoping to make day 3 and South Africa had reduced Australia to 3-15 on day one. He was disgusted, thinking he would miss the action entire. Good times…” Curly roots eh? Leo Sayer smile. 46th over: Australia 127-3 (Labuschagne 46, Head 9) Shot! Siraj serves up a half volley and Marnus drives away handsomely for four. 45th over: Australia 122-3 (Labuschagne 42, Head 8) Marnus drives Rana for three. It’s all going off in Wellington by the way. 44th over: Australia 117-3 (Labuschagne 39, Head 6) The ursine Travis Head punches off the back foot for a single. Labuschagne is then beaten by a beauty from Siraj that bounced more than he thought and angled past the splice of his blade. This is a great Test deck, something in it for both bat and ball if the requisite graft is applied. Eamonn Maloney mentions that game at Adelaide in 2006 in his email and to be honest I zoned out after that. Something about deckchairs. Yadda Yadda. Excuse me whilst I do my deep breathing exercises for a minute or two. “We used to take our folding chairs to the Adelaide test every year growing up, and sat under the Moreton bay figs on the hill. After spending most of my adult life overseas I’m attending on Sunday for the first time since THAT famous fifth day of the ashes test (YOU know which one). I bought a ticket for the hill imagining nothing in the undoubtedly wonderful renovation this stadium has undergone since that time would preclude the bringing of a folding chair - indeed why else preserve the hill? but I can’t see any chairs on the hill on TV. Looks like I’ll be on the bones of my arse for 8 hours. I’m sure the renovation of this stadium has served the public interest but Things Have Been Lost!” 43rd over: Australia 116-3 (Labuschagne 39, Head 5) Hear that? A sigh of relief reverberates around Australia as Harshit Rana replaces Bumrah at the Cathedral end. The pressure valve is immediately released as Marnus clips beautifully off his pads for four and follows up by flicking a leg stump half volley to the fence for another. Rana tightens up with three dots on a good length. Labuschagne has been proactive this morning and taken every opportunity to score. His flame is growing stronger with each run and over spent out in the middle. Nick Cave would be happy. Maybe. Nick? 42nd over: Australia 108-3 (Labuschagne 31, Head 5) Oh my cuss. Siraj gets his Lionel Richie on and beats Head three times in the over! The wobble seam is deployed and beats Head twice in succession before the batter then decides to throw the kitchen sink, toaster and fridge at a length ball but connects only with the Adelaide breeze. A maiden. Phew. 41st over: Australia 108-3 (Labuschagne 31, Head 5) Travis Head arrives in the middle. This is Box Office stuff. Head leaves his first ball but is then beaten all ends up by his second, feet in quicksand as Bumrah spears one past his outside edge. That was so close, the pink ball passing the edge by a Mr Creosote wafffer thin distance. Bosh! Bumrah goes a shade too full and Head clobbers him through cover for four. Sing it, Damien. Steve Smith is strangled down the leg side! What a sickener! An innocuous delivery and an attempted leg glance from Smith that Pant safely snaffles. Smith can’t believe he’s done that, he throws his head back and stomps off the pitch like a toddler denied a lollipop. 40th over: Australia 103-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 2) Siraj gets another ball to jag and spit off the surface, Smith gets a thick outside edge off it that falls short of gully. After saying it looked a good day for batting this pitch has looked quite lively at the start of day two. Marnus drives down the ground and they run a lesser-spotted but always satisfying all run four, that’s the hundred up for Australia. 39th over: Australia 97-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 1) Australia approach the team three figures. Every run feels crucial at the moment. Bumrah oversteps this time to gift one more. Smith is on the front foot, willing himself to get forward and blunt the threat from Bumrah. He survives but can’t get away from the danger end. 38th over: Australia 96-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 1) Siraj joins the dots but oversteps to add one to the total. Marnus is solid in defence and gets his hands out of the way to leave well alone a ball outside off that darts back a bit off the pitch. The pink ball glinting under the afternoon sun, looks like plenty of lacquer still on it. Lacquer is a good word, isn’t it? Lacquer. Mmmm. 37th over: Australia 95-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 1) Here comes Steve Smith, is the gimlet eye fading? He’ll need both peepers laser focused to repel Bumrah with his dander up. A forward poke sees Smith off the mark with an inside edge into the leg side. Marnus then leans on a full ball and works it wide of mid-on for his second three of the morning. Three slips in place, both sides going toe-to-toe. Absorbing stuff. Bumrah Strikes! Nothing McSweeney could do about that really, angled in from wide of the crease and then rearing up and shaping away at the last moment, the ball taking the outside edge and flying to Pant behind the stumps. India are in amongst them. Speaking of painful extractions, solidarity to Thomas Bancroft (presumably no relation) who is following both Test matches whilst overcoming a Wisdom tooth removal procedure. Whisky and cricket is it Thomas? Sounds like a good treatment plan. 36th over: Australia 91-1 (McSweeney 39, Labuschagne 23) Siraj wheels off in celebratory raptures a la Stuart Broad after scudding one into Marnus’ front pad but then the bowler looks a smidge silly as the umpire says no and Rohit doesn’t call for a review, correctly indicating there was a meaty inside edge onto pad to save Marnus. 35th over: Australia 90-1 (McSweeney 39, Labuschagne 23) Jasprit Bumrah starts with a maiden, angled in at pace, pink ball darting off the surface like a cobra’s tongue. Good luck, lads. 34th over: Australia 90-1 (McSweeney 39, Labuschagne 23) Mohammed Siraj bustles in to Marnus. A couple of slips and a gully in place. Runs straight away! Marnus whips a ball from outside off through the leg side, doesn’t gave the legs for a boundary but three runs to start the day. Positive intent from the beleaguered batter. McSweeney defends the next four balls as Siraj lands it on a good length, a single off the final balls sees four runs PLUNDERED off the first over. Here come the players, let’s do this. The sun is beating down in Adelaide, mocking my double sock and thermals get up here in London. It looks a day for batting, can India winkle a few early and get back into this match. Only one way to find out! PLAY “More power to your typing fingers, and may the goddess of sleeping toddlers smile kindly on your household!” Brendon Murley gets the none existent prize for first email of the day! (Get in touch, for the love of all that is holy, details on the left flank of this page) Ah, the Goddess of sleeping toddlers! Smiling? She’s been gurning and blowing raspberries for the past three years Brendon, as my capacious eye bags will testify. Who needs sleep though? Especially when there is a Smörgåsbord of Antipodean Test matches to tuck into. Run (s) Run (s) Rudolph Marnus! “All I want for Christmas is a rock n roll ‘lectric guitar career saving 12th Test century.” Catchy. Marnus and McSweeney grafted away under lights last evening, can they make it count this morning and both go on to make a chatter halting score? It’ll be a fascinating first hour, it always is, isn’t it? Both men would love to be able to crack on and will be harbouring desires of half centuries at the least. I’m harbouring desires for a 3.34am UK time cup of coffee but daren’t pad down the hallway past a snoring three year old in case of a floorboard creak and an early hours wake up that could really put the cat amongst the pigeons toddlers ‘mongst the OBOs. This Test is ticking along at a fair old lick but pales in comparison to the warp speed happenings over the ditch. England have fired up the afterburners in Wellington. I’ll forgive you for joining Rob Smyth for a few overs on t’other OBO, make sure you come back, mind. The Rory Burns play of the day: Geoff was indeed in fine fettle yesterday, as was another cloud busting bloke with a wavy barnet – Mitchell Starc. Sporting songs from the outer are usually dross, partly because they’re most often sung tunelessly by annoying drunks, and partly because they usually consist of one cringey couplet jammed with no consideration of cadence or metre into the scarcely heeded melodic line of a mid-tier radio hit. The few that are slightly more artful stand out, appearing far better by virtue of their company than they might objectively deserve. One such of recent years that provides occasional enjoyment is: “Hark, the herald angels sing – Mitchell Starc, the new-ball king.” The phrasing fits, the use of a Christmas hymn is seasonally apt for Australia in December or January, and the sentiment reflects a cricketing truth. Starc with a lacquered Kookaburra (while that sounds a strange object to possess without context) is a menace. But swap out the lyrics of “new-ball” for “pink-ball” and it would be even more apt. In the day-night Test format, nobody has done it better. Hello and welcome to what promises to be a intriguing second say with the pink ball at the Adelaide Oval. Australia got themselves back into the Border Gavaskar series yesterday by landing a few punches on India’s well groomed chops, bloodying their opponents nose under lights and finishing day one just 86 runs behind with nine first innings wickets in hand. James Wallace here in a stormy London town, I’ve got the honour of being on the tools for the first half of the day before m’esteemed colleague Jonathan Howcroft tags in to hoop the OBO about under darkening skies later on. Play will be underway in just over 40 minutes time, here’s Geoff Lemon’s report of a dominant Aussie display on day one to whet your whistle:"

          "headline": "Recasting masculinity: the cheerleaders subverting Austria’s gender stereotypes",
          "bodyText": "Dressed in short shorts and tight T-shirts, they bounded on to the gymnasium floor. After the female roller derby teams had pushed, pounded and smashed into each other, the men and their pompoms were now on the same court in Vienna, ready to offer up the exact opposite: a hip-shaking, acrobatic half-time show. “We wanted to play with the stereotypes,” said Andreas Fleck, one of the founders of Austria’s Fearleaders, believed to be Europe’s first squad of male and non-binary cheerleaders. “We have this idea of heroic, strong male players on the field and on the sidelines these very sexualised female cheerleaders. We wanted to turn this around.” Their boundary-pushing quest traces back to 2011 when Vienna became home to its first roller derby team. Made up mainly of women, their fiercely aggressive, full-contact playing style challenged the clichéd role of women in sport. Fleck and others soon wondered if there was a way to push things further. “We wanted to create this tension between roller derby, this very physical sport that is mainly done by female players, and these more fragile, funny and dainty men on the sidelines supporting this team,” he said. What emerged was the Fearleaders, made up of about 30 members whose shorts, braces, colourful headbands and shimmying dance moves have become a staple of Vienna’s roller derby scene and beyond. The group echoes the inclusiveness of roller derby, in which teams on roller skates use their hips, shoulders and chests to block a member of the other team from scoring points, and which is one of the few sports that welcomes trans and non-binary players. The Fearleaders name is a nod to their courage, Fleck said. “There’s our own fears of getting into this outfit and exposing yourself to an audience,” said Fleck. “And then there’s the example we try to provide to others, to erase their fears so that they say: ‘OK they can do it, why can’t I?’” Reactions from those around them have been positive, but the extent of what the squad is up against was laid bare soon after its 2013 launch when it was featured in a left-leaning publication. “It was really terrifying to see the comments,” said Fleck, citing one that had hoped for their deaths and others that directed “homophobic, transphobic” vitriol at them. “We live in a very progressive bubble, but outside this bubble I think there is still a lot of rejection and a lot of hate.” For member Fabian Schipfer, the reaction was in some ways unsurprising. “Right now society is really polarised, especially on gender topics,” he said. “Especially on social media, we definitely feel that we hit some kind of pain point.” Others were swift to follow in the the Fearleaders’ path. By 2016, France had its first all-male cheerleading squad, Les Scrimmage People, launched to support Lille’s roller derby team, while other squads sprung up in Montreuil, east of Paris, and Brittany. What unites all of them is their link to the boundary-pushing world of roller derby, said Emma Darquié, a coach for Les Scrimmage People and player on Lille’s roller derby team. “These squads wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for roller derby,” she said. “It’s a way of continuing the conversation, as roller derby players have shown that team contact sports are not just for men. Now these squads are building on this in their own way, deconstructing these hyper-divisive stereotypes.” In recent years, as terms such as non-binary and toxic masculinity have become more widely used and understood, those behind the Fearleaders wondered whether the initiative had run its course. “At some point we had questioned whether what we were doing was still necessary. We were thinking maybe not,” said Fleck. The sentiment soon shifted as hints began to emerge of what Fleck described as a global “gender backlash”, fuelled in part by an online “manosphere” eager to peddle its own views on manliness. “It’s getting more toxic,” said Fleck. “It’s getting harder to work against these forces because they are getting somehow stronger. They’re getting louder, more popular.” The battle hit home in September when Austria’s far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) won most votes in the general election, buoyed by promises that included amending the country’s constitution to declare the existence of only two genders. It was a sad return to the mindset that had dominated decades ago, said Fleck. “We’ve been thinking a lot about how we can tell a different story about masculinity. What other views on masculinity can we offer society?” The quest to answer these questions breathed new life into the Fearleaders’ raison d’être, he said. “After this year, 2024, we have the feeling that what we do is more important than ever.”"

          "bodyText": "The chewy caramels you get in a chocolate selection box have always been my favourite. Yes, they get stuck in your teeth, but that’s all part of the fun. I typically make these only around this time of year, and using festive spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg just adds to their buttery warmth. You will need a thermometer to make sure the mixture reaches the right temperature to set properly, but don’t let that put you off. They come together quite quickly and look so pretty all wrapped up. Spiced caramels Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Cool 8 hr+ Makes 25-30 140ml double cream 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¾ tsp freshly grated nutmeg 8 whole cloves 250g caster sugar 80g golden syrup 60g salted butter 1 tsp vanilla extract Sea salt flakes, to finish Line a square 20cm cake tin with greaseproof paper, leaving enough overhang to help you pull the caramel out of the tin later. Pour the cream into a small saucepan and heat gently until steaming. Add the spices, stirring well to combine, then take off the heat and leave to infuse. Meanwhile, put the sugar and syrup in a deep-sided saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring every so often. Heat until the mix reaches 155C, then strain the cream into the caramel pan, whisking to incorporate – the mixture will bubble up rapidly, so be careful because it’s extremely hot. Bring it back to a boil and heat until it reaches 125C. Stir in the butter and vanilla, then bring everything back to 125C. Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared tin and top with a little flaky sea salt. Leave the caramel to cool for at least eight hours, or overnight, then use a sharp knife to cut into small pieces. Wrap in greaseproof paper before giving as gifts. The caramels will keep for up to a month in a cool, dry place."

          "bodyText": "I used to be really interested in the world. I’d read lots of news, books from authors around the world and had opinions about world events. I work for a charity that works globally too. But lately I’ve become less engaged. I don’t know if it’s due to having children, fatigue or the harshness of the world, but I feel unplugged from it all and not interested. Equally I’m not interested in anything else as an alternative. I feel my world becoming smaller. I spend hours scrolling Instagram too. How can I find “something” to be interested in again? Eleanor says: When I was in my early teens my dad was trying to explain depression to me because a dear friend had it and I thought she was making a mistake. I interrupted him to pause and savour a bite of sourdough toast with cream cheese. He pointed to that exact moment – there – that’s what your friend can’t feel right now. Many times since then my own interest in the world has come and gone, but I think, when it’s around, it lives in things like sourdough toast. Love for the world is love for the way the milk makes a thundercloud in the tea, or for an interesting bubble of dish detergent, as much as for making a difference or having views on the state of things. If your ability to feel pleasure is totally diminished, you may benefit from seeking psychological help. If your sense of disconnection feels more spiritual than psychological, then “the world” is a big thing to try to get interested in. What answers to that task? Big stuff, stuff we feel we should be interested in: “Go to a museum”, “Read an enriching book”, “See the sunrise.” When we’re in an anhedonic slump – whether depressed or just unplugged – these grand sources of human value don’t always wake up the senses, and that just amplifies the problem. Really, I don’t feel interested even by this? So what if you just poke around doing little stuff and let the feelings lead? That is, don’t do stuff with the mission to feel interested again. Do it fully prepared to be bored, just to see how you feel. In time, the goal is that this reintroduces trying things and making judgments about what you like. Why is this a corrective? Because feeling disengaged isn’t about disliking everything. It’s about not liking anything, as you know. It’s the kind of blah in which a screen feels like the only live option. “What do you do for fun?” “I look at phone.” Very few of us would answer, “What do you value?” with “Screen.” I think its allure when we’re depleted is instead that it’s a kind of absence, a cessation. It’s just not: a blessed, private, effort-free period of not. Everybody needs to “not” now and then, but too much and we lose track of the fact we’re individuals with preferences and values, and crucially, choices. Doing little things to notice how you feel can bring those choices back. You remind yourself that you’re in there; that you have standards by which you measure things, even if the way you feel for the first six or 10 or 12 times is “bored” or “anxious” or “didn’t like it”. Feeling like you’re reacting to stuff as an individual, instead of just passively taking it in, is the beginning of interest; noticing how we react to things might help restore that. An important note: the times when simply “not” seems most appealing are often the times we most need real rest. You’re parenting, working, fatigued. You might just literally not have the energy or for the sustained attention of valuing things. If that’s right, the fix might be to start with genuinely restful things – not Instagram, not nothing, actual rest. The cliches work here: a slow project, a walk, a meditation, deep sleep. As you come back to yourself it might help to start small. There will be world events and great art when you are recharged and ready. In the meantime there is toast. *This question has been edited for length"

          "headline": "College football’s playoff field has tripled. Turns out picking 12 teams is just as hard",
          "bodyText": "This season is the best of times and the worst of times to institute a 12-team playoff in the top tier of college football. It’s the best of times because the results so far have yielded a muddled picture in which picking just four teams would have been extraordinarily difficult, and we’ll need these playoff games to lend some clarity. It’s the worst of times because picking 12 teams is also extraordinarily difficult. Like referees and judges, playoff committee members are doomed to the realization that someone is going to feel aggrieved by their work. For every committee member (there are 13), there are dozens of talk radio and TV hosts ready to bray about the selections. One issue will require a significant rethink in college football is the bloat among the big conferences. We have too many contenders who haven’t faced their fellow contenders. Take the Atlantic Coast Conference, which now extends to the Pacific Coast. The top three teams – SMU (8-0 conference record), Clemson (7-1) and Miami (6-2) – didn’t face each other, and they lost the majority of their games against teams with a 5-3 conference mark. The Big 12 had similar issues. Four teams finished atop the league at 7-2, and the only teams in that group to face each other were Arizona State and BYU. But unless the Big Bang of conference expansion follows the astronomical model of the Big Crunch and reverses itself, we’re stuck with these scheduling quirks. The larger inherent issue is simpler: Selection is subjective. In pro sports, that’s not the case. If the Atlanta Falcons win the NFC South division, they’re in the playoffs. The NHL takes the top three teams in each division and then the next two in the conference standings. Aston Villa finished fourth in the Premier League last year and therefore qualified for the Champions League. In college football, with 134 teams competing for the top prize and each team only playing 12 regular-season games, objective criteria are harder to apply. But not impossible. Nor is it impossible to come up with a measurement that’s easy to follow in real time rather than next-day polls or computations. Computer rankings are objective, but while college football programs are still associated with universities that presumably have math and computer science classes, “the computers” have never been popular in college football circles. They also don’t let fans know exactly what teams need to accomplish on the field. ESPN’s Football Power Index generates numbers that don’t mean much – Texas have an FPI of 26.5, Ole Miss is at 20.5, Penn State is at 19.7, etc. So instead of using the computers to determine a final ranking, let’s use them to establish a reference point. Pick a date – maybe after Week 10, maybe after Week 12 – and set teams into tiers (top 5, top 10, top 20, top 40, etc) based on their computer rankings at that time. There’s no need to update after that – 10 or 12 weeks is long enough to gather plenty of game data, and we want to have clear-cut scenarios in the last couple of weeks. Then we’ll need a new measure: adjusted wins and losses. The idea is simple. A win over a Tier 1 team counts more than a win over a Tier 2 team. A road win over a Tier 2 team counts more than a home win over that same team. A road loss to a Tier 1 isn’t as costly as other losses. Something like this: Wins: 1.5 adjusted wins for defeating a Tier 1 (top 5) team. 1.4 for Tier 2 (6th through 10th) 1.3 for Tier 3 (11th through 20th) 1.2 for Tier 4 (the rest of the top 40) 1.0 for Tier 5 (the rest of the top 100) 0.8 for Tier 6 (everyone else) Losses 0.5 adjusted losses for losing to a Tier 1 team 0.6 for Tier 2 0.7 for Tier 3 0.8 for Tier 4 1.0 for Tier 5 1.2 for Tier 6 Bonus: Winning a road game against a team in the top four tiers is worth an 0.1-point bonus. A road loss against such teams is 0.1 points better than a home or neutral-site loss. Example: Basing values on the ESPN Football Power Index as of 24 November, let’s take a look at two teams contending for a spot in the playoffs who aren’t in the conference finals. Tennessee: actual record 10-2, adjusted record 10.7-1.1 (net 9.6) 1 Tier 1 win (Alabama), worth 1.5 adjusted wins 2 Tier 4 road wins (Oklahoma, Vanderbilt), each worth 1.3 adjusted wins 1 Tier 4 home win (Florida), worth 1.2 3 Tier 5 wins, worth 1.0 each 3 Tier 6 wins (the Volunteers’ non-conference schedule wasn’t particularly strong), worth 0.8 1 Tier 1 road loss (Georgia), 0.4 adjusted losses 1 Tier 4 road loss (Arkansas), 0.7 adjusted losses Indiana: actual record 11-1, adjusted record 10.4-0.4 (net 10.0) 1 Tier 4 home win (Michigan), 1.2 adjusted wins 6 Tier 5 wins, 1.0 each 3 Tier 6 wins, 0.8 each 1 Tier 1 road loss (Ohio State), 0.4 adjusted wins Add it all up through Week 14, and here are the current top-12 teams (*can earn more adjusted wins in a conference championship game): Teams in conference championships can get more adjusted wins, but because we don’t want to punish teams for playing in a final, they won’t get adjusted losses. The only contending team that could still lose points is Army, who will play the traditional Army-Navy game after the conference championships. Because we know how much each win is worth, we can see the maximum net record each team can get. Iowa State are on the bubble with a current net of 8.9. Miami (8.8), Alabama (8.5) and South Carolina (8.4) cannot qualify. Five conference champions win automatic bids, but two of them will finish well above the cutoff line, so only three champions can move up and bump out any of the teams in the top 12. That means the top nine teams are safe. (To break the tie between Boise State and BYU, we can use the ESPN Football Power Index.) The Sun Belt, MAC and Conference USA champions cannot qualify, which leaves the ACC, American and Mountain West champions playing a game of musical chairs with two seats. A few scenarios: Clemson win the ACC. The Tigers could still miss out. At best, they’d be the fifth-best conference champion. (SMU, though, would still qualify.) UNLV win the Mountain West. Boise State is still safe. UNLV would only qualify if Clemson and/or Tulane win their conference finals. Tulane win the American. The Big 12, ACC and Mountain West champions would qualify; Tulane would not. Army win the American and beat Navy. The Black Knights would easily qualify, and Clemson would have no path to the playoffs because the Tigers would finish behind the Mountain West winner. When all the math is done, it won’t differ too much from what the selection committee decides. But it’ll be more definitive, and we can see the situation unfold on the field rather than a Zoom call or boardroom meeting."

          "headline": "Go bright or go Gucci? British Muslim men discuss what they wear to Friday prayers",
          "bodyText": "Every Friday, for eight months, people attending Jummah at one of four mosques in Tower Hamlets became familiar with the same sight: a man with a camera and a woman with a clipboard, chatting to men as they entered and left the mosque, as part of a special project. Jummah, or Friday prayer, is a spiritual highlight of the week that brings the spectrum of Muslim communities together. And ever since it was established by the prophet Muhammad – who described Friday prayers as an “Eid” or celebration – there has been an idea of wearing your “Friday best”. What comprises this uniform is wide-ranging, from monochrome ankle-length Arab thobes to colourful south Asian kurtas, easy tracksuits to stylish blazers. The project set out to document the whole range, and forms the basis of a new exhibition in London’s Bethnal Green called Jummah Aesthetics: British Muslim Men and Their Sartorial Choices. It was the idea of Dr Fatima Rajina, a sociologist based at the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre, and Rehan Jamil, a social documentary photographer from London. The 25 photographs were taken over the course of eight months, from February to October. They wanted to capture a demographic that Jamil argues “gets left behind when we’re talking about clothing”. Both he and Rajina were keen to shift the focus to men, since the spotlight has been almost exclusively on Muslim women’s fashion through the global phenomenon of modestwear. The styles captured are eclectic. “Our communities cross so many cultures,” says Jamil, a born and bred East Ender who attends Friday prayers every week in the mosques where he chose to photograph. He describes Jummah at East London Mosque “like a mini Hajj every Friday”, as it attracts around 7,000 worshippers from all walks of life, in all styles of clothing. Jamil himself wears Nehru-collar shirts in the summer in a nod to his south Asian heritage, and Oliver Spencer wool polo tops in the winter. He pairs them with Nudie jeans made from recycled fibres, in a conscious effort to wear environmentally friendly clothing, as inspired by his faith to take care of the planet. One of the men featured in the exhibition is Maruf, 33, who was dressed in a grey blazer and pristine white cotton thobe in his photograph. He is an imam of Bangladeshi heritage at Brick Lane Mosque and likes to wear white on Fridays as it is the purest colour. “It gives me a special feeling, and makes me feel happier,” he says. “It’s important for Muslims to dress their best for Jummah. We’re presenting ourselves before God, like people do before a king.” The 22-year-old Sufi, who has half-Yemeni, half-Kenyan heritage, opted for a light coloured, smart-casual shirt and trousers from Uniqlo the day he was photographed. He likes to be comfortable, clean and presentable. “I keep it simple, humble and smart, as I’m in the house of Allah,” he says. When it comes to wearing colour, Rajina noticed a generational gap: they found that the older men are far more comfortable in bright colours such as purple, green, pink or mustard, perhaps indicating a closer connection to their country of origin, since colourful clothing is an inherent part of the culture in places such as Bangladesh and west Africa. But many of the younger men spoke of how they would never wear bright colours, preferring grey, black, or navy – which Rajina observes is “more in line with British men’s fashion”. For Meraaj, a 24-year-old entrepreneur of Sri Lankan heritage, he calls his vibe a “British Muslim look”. In the photo, Meraaj wears a traditional, black Moroccan thobe with a Gucci jacket and Nike trainers, saying it’s a mixture of comfort and cultures; a “new generation twist on the old fashion of thobes”. Thobes, while Arab in origin, are often adopted by non-Arab men as a practical, modest garment to pray in. It is a choice influenced by the prophet Muhammad, who himself wore one. Also emulating the prophet’s attention to cleanliness and self-grooming, many of the men photographed prepare for Jummah by having a shower, clipping their nails, getting their hair trimmed and beards oiled. “I want to come in my best form,” says Meraaj. “It’s nice to show everyone I’m proud to be Muslim.” Each picture tells a story, and for Rajina, many of the chapters are written into the details. She points to the picture of 41-year-old Musa, who works in Tower Hamlets, and has prayed at Shoreditch mosque for the past six years. He is wearing a purple top from Sierra Leone in his photograph and, she says, “if you look closer, you’ll spot that he’s holding a tasbeeh [prayer beads] in one hand, and a mobile phone in the other, which signifies the age-old spirituality v modernity debate”. She points to another image of an “uncle”, Latif, a 70-year-old retired businessman, in a plain shalwar kameez, air-bubble trainers and a topi (cap) that he’s been wearing for more than 20 years, given to him by a friend. Look closer and you’ll notice the geometric embroidery adorning the front of the hat, which is particular to the Sindh province of Pakistan. It was important for Jamil that he was photographing a community to which he belongs. “If we as a minority Muslim community in London don’t document our own lives, we can’t expect anyone else to do it for us,” he says. “From the point of view of a social documentary photographer, it is best when we can document our own communities.” Rajina agrees. “One of my frustrations as an academic is that so much of the research is oversaturated with Muslim men in relation to radicalisation and the Prevent strategy, which you see in the dominant mainstream discourse too,” she says. Her hope is for people to enjoy the images from a fashion and portrait – as well as sociological – perspective. “No one is looking at Muslim men from this lens.” Jamil sees Jummah aesthetics as only gaining more ground. “Friday prayer, and dressing for it, is not something that is dying out,” he says. He envisages more conversation will be sparked, and hopes that traditional clothing will be worn beyond religious or ceremonial contexts to “normalise and destigmatise wearing traditional attire”. “Traditional clothing carries so much history, meaning and artistry, and wearing it in everyday life is a powerful way to celebrate identity and heritage. Imagine walking through the streets of London and seeing a vibrant mix of agbadas, thobes, kilts, kurtas and more, all blending seamlessly with modern urban fashion,” Jamil adds. “Fashion is such a great medium for storytelling, and this kind of visibility could foster mutual appreciation and understanding between different communities.” • Jummah Aesthetics: British Muslim Men and Their Sartorial Choices is at Oxford House, Bethnal Green, London, until 31 January 2025. It is part of an initiative funded by the British Academy, with support from the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre at De Montfort University and Oxford House"

          "bodyText": "I’m surprised by how many people seem to believe beauty is a risky theme for gift giving. There’s a belief that there’s something inherently impolite or implicitly critical about a present designed to improve the appearance of the recipient. But the instinct to groom is universal, self-care is healthy and almost everyone likes to look their best. Provided one avoids specific “problem solvers”, like anti-wrinkle cream, hair removal (or, indeed, its restoration) and anything related to cellulite, then there’s no reason for anyone to take offence. Well-chosen beauty products make great stocking fillers, luxury presents and spare gifts for unexpected visitors, such as new partners or stray aunts. Plus, they often treat the recipient to something they’d never justify buying for themselves. With that last point in mind, I usually follow a policy of getting the smallest thing for my budget, rather than trying to maximise it with stacks of bulky product. For example, an under £20 allowance would probably be spent on a single luxury nail polish rather than a hamper of toiletries that may just gather dust in a regifting drawer. I’d sooner blow a £15 budget on one decadent bath foam than on a generic hand wash and lotion duo, and so on. It feels more special and indulgent. But that isn’t to say beauty gifts can’t be useful – the creamy suds of a single tablet of French soap can elevate everyday ablutions into moments of pure pleasure. So what follows is a wholly subjective list of frothy, fabulous and gratuitous fancies for all genders and ages. Think of them as the gift of guiltless frivolity. *** My favourite beauty gifts for Christmas 2024 *** On-trend makeup bag Nobody’s Child makeup bag, £25 nobodyschild.com Damson Madder makeup bag, £28 damsonmadder.com Leopard is huge this season.

Indispensable. *** Recycling reminder Dunelm blush bathroom bin, £26 dunelm.com A huge amount of recycling comes from the bathroom, but because fewer than half of us own a bathroom recycling bin, it gets tossed into general waste. It’s not the sexiest gift, but I’ve bought several of them for loved ones and they’ve proved habit-changing. *** Instant glow Saie Glowy Super Gel, £22 cultbeauty.co.uk Makeup can be tricky to choose for others, but this glowy, transparent gel works on every skin tone, in low- or high-maintenance routines.

I can’t have been the only one, because here, at last, they are. The tomatoey No One Elsie is my favourite. *** Fun shower foam Sundae Gingerbread whipped shower foam, £13 simplybe.co.uk sundaebody.co.uk This warm, spicy, squirty-cream-style shower foam brings out my inner six-year-old, and I like it. *** Ultra-moisturising body butter Fenty Skin Butta Drop whipped oil body cream, £17 boots.com fentybeauty.co.uk Don’t sleep on Fenty’s skincare – it’s very, very good.

          "headline": "Typhoo Tea bought out of administration for £10m",
          "bodyText": "The historic tea brand Typhoo has been bought out of administration by the vapes and batteries maker Supreme in a £10m rescue deal. The company filed to appoint administrators last Wednesday, risking the future of the 121-year-old brand. However, the London-listed Supreme, which last week confirmed it was in talks over a rescue deal, said on Monday it had completed a deal to buy the brand. Supreme said it would pay £10.2m to buy Typhoo, in a deal that values the brand’s stock and trade debts at £7.5m. Typhoo has long been one of Britain’s favourite tea brands after launching in Birmingham in 1903, becoming the first pre-packaged tea sold in the UK. The company was founded by John Sumner, who created the product to help with his sister’s indigestion and named the brand after the Mandarin word for doctor. It generated revenues of more than £25m for the year to 30 September, with a pre-tax loss of nearly£38m, including £24m in exceptional costs. The new owner said it planned to run Typhoo on a “capital-light, outsourced manufacturing model” in an attempt to improve profits. The administration followed several years of declining sales, mounting debts and even a break-in last year at Typhoo’s Wirral factory In August 2023, intruders broke in and occupied the Moreton plant for several days, causing “extensive damage” to the facility and making it inaccessible. As a result, Typhoo had to close the plant and switch production, racking up £24m of costs, including nearly £7m on property impairments. The company is also likely to have been been hit by a fall in tea consumption in Britain, with younger consumers turning to coffee, energy drinks and newer trends such as bubble tea. A consumer survey by Statista last year found that, for the first time, coffee had overtaken tea as the most popular hot drink with Britons, with 63% drinking coffee regularly and only 59% drinking tea. According to the market analysts Mintel, consumption of tea is expected to fall by 8% between 2023 and 2028. Insolvency specialists at Kroll were appointed to oversee the administration process and strike a sale deal. It is understood the business has fewer than 100 employees. The move is part of a strategy by Supreme to expand its operations away from vaping, after buying the soft drinks business Clearly Drinks earlier this year, before a planned government crackdown on disposable vapes. The Supreme chief executive, Sandy Chadha, said: “The acquisition of Typhoo Tea marks a significant step in our broader diversification strategy and brings one of the most iconic UK consumer brands into the Supreme family. “I believe Typhoo Tea will thrive under our ownership, further benefiting from Supreme’s significant market reach and successful track record in creating brand loyalty, making us an ideal fit for this business.”"

          "headline": "Saka and Ødegaard’s special relationship has Arsenal humming",
          "bodyText": "Oh for heavens’s sake, get a room. Actually don’t. This is, on reflection, a global spectator sport. But show a little restraint. People are watching. Including, it seemed for much of the first half at the London Stadium, the entire West Ham defence. There were times during those 49 wild minutes when Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard seemed to be playing pretty much in the same pocket of air, like a pair of hummingbirds, beautifully conjoined. Footballers who work together like this are often said to have an understanding or a relationship. This was the real thing. You complete me. No, seriously. Just look at the numbers. This was Ødegaard’s third start in eight days since slipping back into the team just before the international break. There had been so much talk about what his return might mean, with all due caution about overloading one player with superhero problem‑solving powers. But the team really has bloomed under his hand, or in Saka’s case rebloomed, bloomed a little more. By the break here Arsenal were running at 13 goals in their last two and a half games, nine of them assisted or scored by Saka and Ødegaard, with Saka’s personal tally three goals and four assists. Ødegaard’s return hasn’t just been a boost. This has been a homecoming. It’s the end of The Railway Children out there. Daddy’s back, walking out of the steam in his tweed coat and homburg hat. And everything’s going to be different now. At least, it is against this West Ham defence. For long periods in that first half the home team simply didn’t apply any resistance to this process, reduced to the football equivalent of one of those paper‑thin wasabi seaweed crackers, all branding and plastic, a little colouring and sheen, but basically not really there. By half-time Saka and Ødegaard had taken 60 touches between them, just under a third of West Ham’s total from one to 11. Those are all touches near your goal, by the best players in the opposition team, often in space, allowed to dream and twirl and basically dance in each other’s eyeline. Around this Arsenal and West Ham dished up a genuinely crazy game of football. It took 10 minutes to open the scoring. Pablo Sanz, West Ham’s designated set-piece sidekick, had appeared next to Julen Lopetegui for Arsenal’s first corner, matching up the Arteta‑Tover double act. As the ball was sent fizzing into the back of the West Ham net Sanz just turned and walked back, shoulders hunched, and it really is a long way in this ground, the walk of set‑piece shame. The delivery from Saka was a flat, hard skimmer. Arsenal had lumped the back post with the usual knot of black shirts, kettling West Ham in their own area. There was the familiar phalanx advance as the ball came in, all blocks and closed lanes, players there just to eat up space while Gabriel, the running back in this scrimmage, goes hunting for the ball. His marker Michail Antonio was still pressing through the crowd like a flustered shopper as the ball was headed past Lukasz Fabianski. The London Stadium had been at its cavernous best at kick-off, a vast hanger of cold, white light, still weirdly angled, as though someone has just jammed this giant Lego structure down on its base and crunched it about until it sticks. At which point, enter: the madness. By half-time the scoreline read West Ham 2-5 Arsenal, as it would stay to the end, five of those goals in the space of 13 minutes. Arsenal’s second was the high point of the Ødegaard-Saka fever, a goal so elegant it felt almost sarcastic. Saka started and ended the key combination, cutting inside down one of those wormholes that is somehow invisible to every opponent, laying the ball back to Ødegaard, then carrying on because he knows now what happens when you do this. The pass back into Saka’s path was a thing of beauty, floated like a soap bubble through the damp Stratford air, and also through the human props posing as West Ham defenders. Saka took the ball on his thigh then laid it sideways to Leandro Trossard to score. Six minutes later it was Saka again, this time slaloming through the claret flags and winning a penalty kick that he then presented to Ødegaard, not actually down on one knee in the restaurant but almost. Ødegaard duly buried it. That made it a 34-minute hat‑trick of goal involvements for Saka, which presumably means he gets to take home the pump that blew up the match ball. Arsenal’s fourth two minutes later was more fine play but also a little sickly because it involved West Ham just standing and watching Trossard’s perfect pass over the top for Kai Havertz. Even training cones have some kind of presence. This was frankly a disgrace to the cone. West Ham pulled a couple of goals back. Saka put away a penalty right on half-time after Fabianski decided to deal with another inswinging corner by punching Gabriel in the head. Go for the high ball, but it’s not a free hit. This isn’t purge night. And that was pretty much that, prelude to a languid postcoital cheroot of a second half. Ground may have been lost in the meantime. But this felt like the full resumption of a beautiful friendship."

          "bodyText": "“The noise never stops,” says Karla Hart, her voice competing with the hum of approaching helicopters. “I can feel them before I see them.” She looks at her phone to check a website that monitors air traffic and identifies operators. Hart wants to know whether the pilots are adhering to legal flight routes. A few minutes later, five helicopters, flying in formation, crisscross the grey October skies above Hart’s home in Juneau, Alaska’s capital. “I get groups of two to five helicopters flying over my house every 20 minutes. On any given day, that adds up to 50 to 75 flights. It’s impossible to enjoy my garden or concentrate on work.” For Hart and other Juneau residents, the noise from helicopters shuttling cruise tourists to remote glaciers is one of the many reminders of how their lives are being upended by a city that has embraced industrial tourism. Cruise passengers disembark to explore Juneau, Alaska, in September. Vessels like the Ovation of the Seas can carry more than 4,000 passengers. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian Juneau is one of the US’s most remote towns, accessible only by air or sea. The waters surrounding it are the traditional fishing grounds of Alaska’s Indigenous communities. It is wedged between towering mountains and the Gastineau Channel, a dramatic vista for more than 1.5 million cruise passengers who visit annually. Juneau was historically reliant on timber and gold, but as those industries have declined, the city now depends on tourism and government sector jobs. Cruise season runs from April to October, with as many as five vessels docking daily in the heart of the historic district. Ships such as the Ovation of the Seas and Norwegian Bliss, with passenger capacities exceeding 4,000 plus crew, arrive in the morning and depart by nightfall, only to be replaced by new arrivals. This cycle continues until the treacherous Taku Winds, with gusts reaching more than 100mph, signal the end of the season. Juneau activist Karla Hart in her home office. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian The rhythm of the cruise season dictates daily life for Juneau’s 32,000 residents. Local people monitor the schedule provided by the Alaska Cruise Ship Association and avoid the centre during peak cruise hours. Traditional seasons have been replaced by two distinct periods: cruise and non-cruise. Under an agreement with the City of Juneau, up to 16,000 cruise passengers disembark daily from Sunday to Friday, with a cap of 12,000 on Saturdays. Annually, cruise passengers outnumber the local population by 50 to one. Hart eagerly anticipates the end of the cruise season. It will offer a break from traffic congestion on the town’s single-lane road, and the relentless noise from aircraft ferrying tourists seeking a brief taste of Alaska wilderness. Souvenir shops selling little that’s authentically Alaskan, alongside jewellery stores offering Tasmanite and pendants for couples celebrating milestones, will shutter. Themed pubs, aspiring to evoke a bygone era, will close for the season. Hart, a former tourism business owner turned activist, is at the centre of a political fight that has divided the community. She spearheaded Proposition 2, a ballot initiative aimed at banning cruise ships on Saturdays and 4 July. In October, it was defeated by a margin of about 60/40, with approximately 10,000 people voting, more than in the mayoral election, which took place at the same time. “We’ve become an amusement park,” Hart says. “The soul of Juneau is being sold off piece by piece.” Ships must negotiate the Gastineau Channel before docking in Juneau’s historic district. Photograph: BriBar/Getty Images A humpback whale breaches in nearby Stephens Passage, where tourists take whale-watching and fishing trips. Photograph: Paul Souders/Getty Images Residents cherish their access to Alaska’s vast wilderness – its forests, mountains, waters and glaciers. They value the security and sense of community that defines small-town life in America. But Juneau’s identity has fundamentally changed with the rise of an industry that monetises experiences local people take for granted. Hiking, whale watching, fishing and kayaking – everyday activities for Juneauites – are packaged and sold at premium prices aboard the cruise ships. “It is a once-in-a-lifetime trip,” says Pat Farrell, who is in Juneau with his wife, Freda. The semi-retired couple from Dublin are passengers on the Celebrity Solstice and are on a typical seven-night Alaska itinerary. After a day of excursions, they return to the ship, where meals and drinks are already paid for. They take a few minutes to break away from the stream of passengers descending the terminal and crossing the ship’s gangway. Nearly 320 metres long and 19 decks high, the Celebrity Solstice is fully lit, shimmering in the late Alaskan summer evening. It’s hard to argue that these giant ships aren’t an engineering marvel. Many passengers see their experience as a ‘once-in-a-lifetime trip’, but this is also seen as ‘last-chance tourism’ because of climate breakdown. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian “I wanted to see the glaciers before they melt,” says Freda. Pat adds: “We’ve seen things we never would have, like glaciers and whales. It’s just beautiful.” Though conscious of the environmental impact of their cruise, they wanted to see these places before it was too late. The Farrells have noticed banners and storefront display stickers promoting cruise ship tourism but they are also aware of community divisions. “I see that some of these towns depend on the cruise ships,” Freda says. The ease of travel made the cruise an attractive option though. “Everything is well-organised, and the service is top-notch. It’s hard to resist the temptation. It’s the adventure of going to Alaska.” They tried to support local businesses. “We made it a point to shop at a store that says it’s Alaskan-owned, but I do wonder how the locals feel with so many of us here.” A cruise ship docked in Juneau, Alaska, 5 September 2024.

Photographs: Ed Ou/The Guardian *** The cruise industry is one of the fastest-growing tourism sectors, with more than 30 million people choosing cruises each year, according to the latest report from the Cruise Lines International Association. The industry promotes frontier tourism – visiting remote and “exotic” locations – with ships going into regions such as the Arctic, South Pacific and Galápagos Islands. Prof Jackie Dawson of the University of Ottawa termed the idea of seeing wildlife and habitat before they disappear as “last-chance tourism”. Others have labelled it extinction tourism. Environmentalists are sounding the alarm about the impact of cruise ships on fragile ecosystems. Arved Fuchs, a German adventurer and the first person to reach both the north and south poles on foot in a year, warned five years ago of the problem: “The number of cruise ships is rising, that’s the crux. And the bigger the ship, the more problematic this is.” Cruise ships travel along the Gastineau Channel as Juneau’s pet owners walk their dogs at Savikko Park. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian At a gathering at the Gold Town Theater, where activists and concerned local people are meeting to discuss the daily impact of cruising on Juneau, Stacy Eldemar, a member of the Tlingit Indigenous community, offers a particularly poignant perspective: “I don’t like the uncontrolled growth, the impact on the ecosystem that I’m seeing. [The ships] killed off the herring run. We used to gather herring. Our sacred spaces are disappearing. It is so important that we have these places where silence speaks.” Protect Juneau’s Future, a coalition of business owners and tour operators, opposed Proposition 2. It argues that limiting cruise ships will severely affect businesses, many of which are still recovering from the financial fallouts of the Covid pandemic. The coalition is heavily funded by cruise ship companies, primarily headquartered in Miami. The Alaska Public Offices Commission has recorded donations from Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and the Royal Caribbean Group of $75,000 each to Protect Juneau’s Future. Disney Worldwide services has contributed $30,000. In total, the Commission reports that Protect Juneau’s Future has generated $495,988 in direct cash donations from cruise lines, businesses with cruise ship interests, and a few individual supporters. It has employed two public relations companies to support its work. By contrast, supporters of the ballot have raised about $500. Portland Sarantopoulos, campaign manager for Protect Juneau’s Future, told Juneau Empire in September: “Protect Juneau’s Future is a local organisation led by residents from diverse backgrounds. Our 22 co-chairs and five executive committee members all live in Juneau. In addition to monetary donations from the cruise lines, we are proud of the many small dollar donations made by residents concerned about the negative impacts of Proposition 2.” Karla Hart, seated in front, at a town hall discussion on cruise ship tourism in Juneau in September. Proposition 2, which she backed, was defeated in a ballot a month later. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian When asked about Proposition 2, the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s trade group, responded: “We believe ongoing, direct dialogue with local communities is the best way to collaboratively self-regulate, ensuring great experiences for both residents and visitors while providing a stable market for the many local businesses that depend on the cruise industry.” For business owner Holly Johnson of Wings Airways, the stakes are high. Her company operates five floatplanes that take tourists to see glaciers. She employs 78 people, 18 full-time, and helped to negotiate the agreement to limit cruise passenger numbers. Johnson argues that limiting cruise ships beyond the existing cap would have a real impact on businesses and the community. “Everybody is somehow touched by tourism because that’s the fabric of community, right?” she says. “There’s no bubble where the tourism people live and the other people live, and they go to different grocery stores, and their kids go to different schools, and they go to different hospitals.” She emphasises the ripple effect tourism has on secondary businesses – electricians, food producers, mechanics, fuel stations, for example – and how it provides jobs for young people, who might have few prospects otherwise. Alaska’s wilderness, including the Mendenhall glacier, pictured, is what attracts many visitors but overtourism also puts it at risk. Photograph: Patrick J Endres/Getty Images But Eldemar disagrees. “It’s ironic that the very thing these tourists are seeking is being destroyed by the industry that’s bringing them here.” Finding a balance between economic necessity and preserving Juneau’s way of life may be the town’s most significant battle yet.

You can steam it for that impressive quintessential British pudding look or bake in the oven for ease. It’s laden with jammy Tesco Finest medjool dates, which are known for their softness, succulence and natural sweetness, bringing you a deeply indulgent flavour. Prep 45 min Cook 31⁄2 hr Serves 8-10 250g Tesco Finest medjool dates, pitted and chopped 50g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing 2 tbsp treacle 200g soft light brown sugar 2 eggs, lightly beaten 240g self-raising flour 1⁄2 tsp ground cinnamon 1⁄2 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 1⁄4 tsp sea salt 1 bramley apple, peeled and thinly sliced Tesco Finest Madagascan vanilla ice-cream, to serve For the sauce 50g unsalted butter 2 tbsp treacle 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 75g soft light brown sugar 200ml double cream 2 tbsp Tesco Finest XO brandy Grease a 1-litre pudding basin with butter. Line the bottom with a small disc of parchment paper. Add the dates to a large heatproof bowl, cover with 150ml of boiling water and leave to soak for 30 minutes, then blitz the dates and soaking liquid in a food processor, or with a stick blender, until it becomes a smooth puree. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, treacle, sugar and eggs, then fold in the flour, spices, bicarbonate of soda and salt, followed by the thinly sliced apple and date puree. Spoon into the pudding basin, leaving a small gap for the sponge to rise, and cover with a disc of parchment. Seal the pudding basin with a tight-fitting lid or a double layer of foil, sealed tightly around the basin and tied with cooking string. Place the pudding basin in a steamer or large saucepan containing enough gently simmering water to come halfway up the sides of the basin. Steam for 31⁄2 hours, topping up with water so it doesn’t boil dry. While the pudding is steaming, make the sauce. Tip the butter, treacle, vanilla, sugar and cream into a saucepan and cook over a medium heat for 4–5 minutes, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high and bubble for 3 minutes, then whisk in a pinch of salt and the brandy. When you’re ready to serve, carefully tip the pudding on to a serving plate. Then reheat the sauce and pour it over. Serve with ice-cream, thick cream or pouring cream. If you prefer to bake the pudding, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Grease a medium-sized baking dish with butter. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for 45-50 minutes. Don’t worry if the pudding sinks in the middle a little, it’s super rich and sticky.

          "bodyText": "The buildup to England women’s friendly against the USA on Saturday has lived up to its title. Whatever animosity there was between the teams in the past, the current managers have packed their media appearances with mutual compliments, and radiated enough warmth to defrost the Wembley pitch. Emma Hayes, who swapped Chelsea for the USA a year ago, is looking forward to a hug from Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman, in turn, was thrilled for Hayes’s instant gold in Paris this summer, only 72 days after she began training the side. If the Netherlands, Wiegman’s previous team, hadn’t scuppered Team GB’s Olympic qualification, the first meeting between Wiegman and Hayes might not have been quite this friendly. But the first time that the English game’s two most successful female football coaches met on the pitch was always going to be a fascinating prospect, whenever it happened. Their only previous clashes have been over player availability, during the years they shared custody of some of the same star names – Millie Bright, Lucy Bronze, Lauren James. Chelsea were one of the clubs who got angriest at Wiegman’s demand to release them a full month before last year’s World Cup. That must have been an interesting tussle, given that both women have a reputation for being “direct”. And yet their personalities don’t appear, at first sight, particularly similar. You can’t imagine Wiegman going off script to deliver an on-camera takedown of Joey Barton’s misogyny. It’s just as hard to picture Hayes turning up on the sidelines in an M&amp;S suit and oversize glasses. So how similar are the two? This summer Hayes published A Completely Different Game: My Leadership Playbook. Wiegman’s own book, What It Takes, is subtitled “My Playbook on Life and Leadership”. The two tomes reflect their subjects: Wiegman’s, for instance, delivers the story of her career in a manner as understated as her press conferences. Take her almost parodically matter-of-fact description of the moment England win the Euros: “I cheered and what followed was a group hug.” If Wiegman has a hinterland, you won’t find it in these pages. Hayes’s book, on the other hand, is as revealing as it is forthright. She’s a woman with myriad interests, from the writing of Hunter S Thompson to the documentaries of David Attenborough. She gives her players copies of Hermann Hesse’s classic German novel Siddhartha, and presents them with purple gladioli, explaining how Roman gladiators wore them round their necks to protect them from death. Wiegman has often spoken of how, even when she was at primary school, she wanted to be a PE teacher. Hayes? She wanted to be a spy, and got as far as applying to MI5 at college. She’s still obsessed with espionage today – “I’m fascinated by what it takes to persuade someone to turn against their state and conspire against everything they have ever known or believed in,” she writes. Who knows, perhaps she even allowed herself a grudging nod of admiration for Canada’s Olympic drone operation. What the two women have in common, however, is more significant than their differences. The US played a big significant role in both of their careers. Both travelled there when it offered opportunities they couldn’t find at home – playing, for Wiegman, coaching, for Hayes – and both found themselves in life-changing conversations with the same man, Anson Dorrance, the former lawyer turned head coach of the UNC Tar Heels, who added a World Cup to his 22 national titles when he coached the US women in 1991. In each case, that encounter was an inflexion point. “He argues that too many people work within their own comfort zone,” says Hayes, before adding: “I have never had a weekend off in my working life.” As their roles (not to mention their sport) grew, Wiegman and Hayes had to transition from pitchside trainers to chief executives, making their organisational and strategic skills every bit as valuable as their tactical ones. They also lead from the same fundamental principle – know your people. It’s because of this, rather than in spite of it, that they can employ the directness they’re famed for. When dealing with a female dressing room, says Hayes, she would rather provoke conflict than allow passive-aggressive undertones to take hold. Similarly Wiegman, on first arriving in England, had to learn – then confront – the coded ways of English “politeness”. Intriguingly, both turned to a similar methodology to break through some of those layers of conditioning, to create more honest communication and build resilience within their teams. Staging intra-squad games, they skewed the refereeing so that all the decisions went against the starting XI players. “The players were so preoccupied with a sense of injustice that they lost focus on their individual tasks,” said Wiegman. It was the very lesson she had determined to teach them. Examples like that are part of what Hayes terms the emotional intelligence revolution in football, of which managers such as Jürgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta have been clear proponents. “If I have a strength,” says Hayes, “it is in recognising and repurposing weakness.” Wiegman’s well-documented empathy combines with her candour to bring a similar touch of Brené Brown-ification to the game, about embracing vulnerability. In an industry where young talent is less responsive to old-school authority, and conditioned by the social media bubble, such intelligence becomes more vital than ever. “People seem to find it harder to take instructions nowadays,” notes Hayes. “Instead [they] retreat online, where outlets promote the seductive myth that they know it all.” Whatever tactical battles they bring to Wembley, their shared understanding of the modern female player will probably be their longest lasting legacies in the game. And if they make the game a little friendlier along the way – is that such a bad thing?"

          "bodyText": "Skirts are getting shorter. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but I didn’t want to bring it up until I was sure. At fashion week, the skirts I see on catwalks have been getting shorter for ages, but it’s only in the past year that I’ve really noticed skirts in the wild, the ones that live on pavements and in offices and on trains, following suit. Fashion week is a bubble that doesn’t mean all that much on its own. Lovely clothes on a catwalk are not actually fashion. Fashion is when people start wearing something in real life. The return of the miniskirt has been happening on the catwalk for three years, at least. Back in 2021, as soon as Paris fashion week came roaring back to life post-pandemic, Dior did a whole collection based on the miniskirt. This felt like it might be significant, because Dior have form for setting hemlines that come to rule the world, from 1947’s full-skirted New Look to the between-knee-and-ankle midi length that dominated the years before Covid blanketed the world under sweatpants. But those immediate post-pandemic years were a funny old time in fashion, where we all talked a good game about being desperate to dress up again but pretty much carried on wearing nap dresses and lazy-girl drawstring-closure stuff. Things started to rev up in 2022, when Miu Miu came up with a skirt so short that the pocket linings peeked out from below the knicker-height hem, which caused such a sensation within the ecosystem that cares about such things that the Fashion Museum in Bath announced that the Miu Miu miniskirt – despite not being a dress – was named Dress of the Year 2022. Then last year, a preppy vibe started to emerge, with striped shirts, loafers, and pert little skirts with pleats. And then this year, crucially, I noticed that I wanted to wear shorter skirts. Sorry to make it all about me, but also not sorry, because I honestly think I’m a good litmus test here. I’m not naturally a short-skirt person – the Roman empire of hemlines, for me, will always be a Prada 00s knee-length – so the vibes need to be really strong to nudge me towards a higher hemline. But this spring, the long skirts that once felt fluid felt droopy. Mostly I just wore trousers. And then summer came … except it didn’t, and mostly it was jeans weather. But on the rare occasions that the sun shone for a day or two, I found myself reaching for an above-the-knee skirt. On summer nights out, I noticed a new going-out uniform on the streets – blazer, short skirt, slicked-back hair, gold hoops. Suddenly a short skirt felt cool and relaxed, rather than trying-too-hard. The most important element of an outfit is always the silhouette, rather than the colour or the fabric. A new skirt shape unlocks a new look in a way that a sweater in a different colour, or a dress in a different pattern, just doesn’t. Look, to be clear, I’m not in a miniskirt. When I say shorter skirt, it’s all relative. The hemline is nearer the knee than the thigh. But still, it feels liberating, in an almost primal way. This is not really about whether short skirts suit you or not. You know what looks good on anyone? Being alive to the world around you, being interested in new perspectives, instead of digging in your heels in a futile attempt to resist change. You know what suits everyone? Getting out of a style rut. Life is short. Why shouldn’t your skirt be too? Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Hair by Sam McKnight and Kama Ayurveda. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

          "bodyText": "George Monbiot is right to warn us about the use of soil and carbon credits as part of “the war against reality” everywhere (Trump’s science-denying fanatics are bad enough. Yet even our climate ‘solutions’ are now the stuff of total delusion, 21 November). He omits, though, the other element essential for life on Earth: water. Perhaps he has not heard of the latest Cambridge invention: “water credits”. These have been dreamed up by a “water scarcity group” to address the problem that East Anglia, the region chosen by the government for the greatest growth, is the driest in the country. While new reservoirs are proposed, and pipelines to bring water from as far afield as Wales, it is recognised that it will be years before these are functioning. Meanwhile, large-scale proposals for new hotels, retail, offices, and homes for the thousands of people who will come to work in them, sail through the planning system regardless. Ofwat, the Environment Agency (EA) and Defra have raised serious concerns about Cambridge Water’s ability to meet this greatly increased demand and have written to it, highlighting concerns including flaws in data, leakage and harm caused to our chalk streams by overabstraction. It states unambiguously: “Your current performance is a risk to the environment and security of supply”. The EA has already objected to major developments in this area because of the water scarcity, which means there is no way that they can be sustainable. But thanks to water credits, these rational objections can now be overruled, and the government, together with powerful interest groups, can continue to pursue the god of economic growth unhindered by logic or material facts. It is indeed a “bubble of delusion”, and Monbiot is right: “You can send your legions to war with reality, but eventually we all lose.” Jean Glasberg Councillor, Cambridge city council • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

          "bodyText": "This smooth, comforting soup is a great winter warmer. Roasting intensifies the natural sweetness of both the squash and the garlic, the cumin and smoked pimentón add a lovely, smoky, aromatic depth, while the fresh oregano keeps everything vibrant and earthy. But the best part, as any self-respecting Spaniard will tell you, is the crisp chorizo migas, which is a classic touch that brings with it crunch and a burst of rich, meaty flavour. Spiced roast squash soup with chorizo migas This soup is all about bold flavours and hearty satisfaction, and is a celebration of the season’s best produce. Once made, it will keep in the fridge for a good few days. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6 1 medium-sized squash or pumpkin – acorn or onion squash, or a small crown prince 1 garlic bulb, cloves separated and unpeeled 2 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp smoked pimentón 5 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves stripped 4 tbsp olive oil Salt and black pepper 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped 1.2 litres good chicken stock 75g cured chorizo, finely chopped 150g slightly stale bread, torn into small pieces Extra-virgin olive oil, to finish Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Halve the squash and remove and discard the pith and seeds. Cut the squash halves into skin-on wedges, then arrange on a large baking tray. Scatter the garlic cloves around and about, add the cumin, pimentón, oregano and two tablespoons of olive oil, season generously, then toss so everything is well coated. Pop the tray into the oven and roast for 45-50 minutes, turning occasionally, until the squash is tender and cooked through. Meanwhile, heat a tablespoon of the remaining olive oil in a large saucepan, then gently fry the onion for 15 or so minutes, until soft and translucent, but not coloured. Put the roast squash wedges in the onion pan, then squeeze in the flesh from the roast garlic cloves; discard the papery skins. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer, and cook for a minute or two. Use a stick blender to blitz the squash mix to a smooth soup, then return to a low heat and leave to bubble away gently. Put the last tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the chorizo until it releases its oil. With a slotted spoon, scoop out the chorizo and transfer to a wide bowl, then add the torn bread to the chorizo-flavoured fat in the pan and fry for a couple of minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp all over. Transfer to the chorizo bowl and toss to combine. Ladle the soup into six bowls, drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over each portion and serve with the migas and chorizo scattered on top."

          "bodyText": "That’s it for today, thanks for reading. Here are the main stories: TikTok warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a “licence to be online” because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The Human Rights Commission said the social media ban should not pass in current form. At least three Nationals publicly voiced their concerns over the social media ban bill, including Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and Bridget McKenzie – as well as Liberal MP Garth Hamilton. Opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, later said the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. Australia-China relationship are in “very good shape after “immense improvement”, Chines ambassador Xiao Qian said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said findings of missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry are “horrific”. The sports minister, Anika Wells, said changes to gamblings advertising could affect Australian sport on world stage. An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, announced new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that were introduced to parliament today. Labor’s housing bill passed the senate this afternoon, coming after the Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather ,said his party had “pushed as hard as we can” on housing. The NSW government will refund $5.5m in fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. Queenslanders gathered outside parliament to protest LNP’s treaty stance. Sydney and Melbourne house prices to keep falling but rate cut will cause bounce, report predicts. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. Leading economists have predicted a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year. Christian lobby welcomes anti-abortion bill stay The Australian Christian Lobby has hailed the failure of a Greens motion aimed at discharging a private senators’ anti-abortion bill as “a victory for the democratic process”. The Greens Senate leader, Larissa Water, wanted the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The ACL CEO, Michelle Pearse, welcomed the Coalition and seven crossbenchers voting down the bill: “The ACL was pleased to see senators afford this Bill an opportunity for proper consideration and debate rather than shutting down the democratic process. We must allow this Bill to go to a proper vote.” The Greens motion to discharge the bill followed the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, telling Coalition MPs recently that they should not seek to restart public debate on abortion ahead of next year’s federal election. NSW avoids power supply issues but still faces ‘tight’ days Without jinxing things, NSW has so far avoided any blackouts as temperatures climb in eastern Australia. Sydney’s top temperature was kept to a bearable 28.2C while about 50km to the west, Penrith reached 39.7C to mark the Sydney basin’s warmest maximum for Tuesday. Penrith and a few other outer suburbs can expect a similar top on Wednesday at 39C, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts. The CBD, though, will be a bit hotter than today, heading form 34C – which would be the hottest there since late February. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, wholesale power prices may yet hit their ceiling of $17,500 a megawatt-hour (compared to more typical prices of $125/MWh) later on Tuesday as an indication of a “tight” or strained market. And tomorrow evening there will be more of the same, with a sign that an administered price cap of $600/MWh may kick in too: Aemo has been busy issuing its so-called lack of reserve alerts for NSW and Queensland in the past couple of days. They are intended to highlight when it wants more capacity brought on to ensure “the lights stay on”. The market does tend to respond (hence the absence of blackouts) but the fact Aemo is issuing them from lengthy periods for NSW for parts of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (before they get cancelled) point to the lingering impacts of the heatwave on the grid. And there are storms to look forward to, too. Bubble tea franchise Chatime fined $132,840 for underpaying workers The Fair Work Ombudsman has fined bubble tea franchise Chatime and its managing director $132,840 for the underpayments of more than $160,000 to vulnerable employees at 19 stores across Sydney and Melbourne. Earlier today, the federal circuit and family court imposed a $120,960 penalty against Chatime Australia, and a fine of $11,880 against Chatime Australia managing director, Chen “Charlley” Zhao, for his involvement in some of the underpayments. The court found that between August and December 2016, Chatime Australia paid employees at stores it directly operated flat rates as low as $7.59 to $24.30 an hour and adopted a practice of not paying Fast Food Industry Award entitlements such as loadings and penalty rates. As a result, 152 employees, including 41 junior workers aged below 21 and 95 visa holders, were underpaid a total amount of $162,533. Many of the visa holders were international students. The underpaid staff worked at 10 Chatime outlets across Sydney in Bondi Junction, Chatswood, Wetherill Park and the CBD; and nine Chatime outlets across Melbourne, in Dandenong, Doncaster, Glen Waverley, Cheltenham and the CBD. In his judgment, Judge Nicholas Manousaridis rejected Chatime Australia’s submission that the contraventions should not fall into the category of being either “serious” or “substantial”, and found that the matter involved a large number of employees who were underpaid basic Award entitlements. “Penalties should be set to signal to persons who manage companies that they will be met with substantial penalties if, through their neglect, they permit companies they manage to contravene terms of an award or any other industrial laws or instruments that might apply.” An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Greens indicated earlier on Tuesday that the motion would be deferred until February but the party’s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, suddenly brought on the vote on Tuesday afternoon. Waters was asking the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The Greens decided to ask the Senate to discharge the bill after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election. The Greens had hoped to secure the numbers to remove the bill and put pressure on the Coalition on a sensitive issue which the major parties usually consider a matter of conscience. But the opposition leadership pushed back, arguing it would set a bad precedent to use a majority vote to discharge a private senators’ bill – and implying it could happen to others. The opposition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, said he “would not and will not ever vote for this bill or any measures that restrict women’s reproductive rights”. But he said removing it would impede private senators’ rights and was a precedent that could be used against other bills. “Senators in particular should reflect on the precedent this motion sets that could see other bills discharged just because a majority opposed them,” Birmingham said. “Given this bill has been on the notice paper for almost two years, the decision of the Greens to pursue this at this time is clearly about politics, not the substantive issue.” The motion was lost, 30 votes to 28, with 18 senators not present. ACT independent senator David Pocock, two One Nation senators, former Liberal turned independent Gerard Rennick, United Australia party senator Ralph Babet and Tasmanian independents Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell joined the Coalition in opposing the motion. Pocock and Tyrrell both spoke in the chamber, saying they opposed the bill itself but supported the principle of allowing a private senators’ bill to remain and be debated. Larissa Waters suggested the Coalition’s move in defeating the motion contradicted Dutton’s edict to his partyroom. “By threatening crossbenchers with retaliation if they supported a Greens move to protect women’s rights, the Liberals … kept an anti-abortion bill on the Senate notice paper,” Waters told Guardian Australia. “The Liberal game-playing has confirmed that Mr Dutton does not want to talk about abortion because it would reveal that his party wants to restrict women’s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.” The NSW government will refund $5.5m worth of fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. More than 23,000 penalty notices will be withdrawn and the refunds will include any total or partial payments on the fines. The government committed to withdraw and refund the fines after a legal campaign by the Redfern Legal Centre (RLC) and Maurice Blackburn who asserted that the fines were improperly issued and invalid. Maurice Blackburn valued the more than 23,000 fines, some of which had not been repaid, at approximately $15m. In a statement, from RLC and Maurice Blackburn, they said the announcement came after Maurice Blakcburn notified the government it would file a class action if Revenue NSW did not withdraw and refund the fines. The RLC said the fines, which were typically worth $1,000 to $5,000, were disproportionately issued to socioeconomically disadvantaged people living in western and south-western Sydney. RLC found that among those fined were Indigenous children, children with cognitive impairments, and children experiencing homelessness. In 2022, the NSW government withdrew 33,000 fines related to Covid-19 health measures after it lost a legal challenge by RLC. The court found the fines were invalid because they did not include sufficient information about the offence. On Tuesday, the department of customer service said the remaining 23,000 fines also lacked details “which may render them technically deficient and place their validity in doubt”. Samantha Lee, supervising solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre, said: This outcome is the result of a significant and lengthy effort by Redfern Legal Centre, a team of dedicated counsel and Maurice Blackburn. The impact of Covid fines on marginalised communities and on children – was disproportionate, unreasonable, and unjust. ‘Nitazenes are extremely potent’: two opioid overdoses in NSW Two people in NSW have been hospitalised with severe opioid overdoses, prompting health authorities to warn about the dangers of synthetic opioids in fake oxycodone. The two people suffered overdoses after taking what they believed to be oxycodone tablets described as yellow unmarked round tablets, sold as OxyContin 40 mg. However, NSW health says they contained nitazenes – extremely potent synthetic opioids which are more likely to stop breathing than other opioids. NSW Poisons Information Centre medical director, Dr Darren Roberts, said these drugs can be hundreds of times more potent than oxycodone and can cause severe overdose or death. He said: “Nitazenes are extremely potent and can vary widely in their strength.” “As they are illicit and unregulated, there is no way of knowing what type of nitazene is present or what dosage is being taken. The strength and contents can vary widely, even within the same batch.” NSW Health said nitazenes have been detected in vapes and in fake tablets, such as benzodiazepines, and in drugs thought to be heroin or MDMA. Roberts said it was strongly recommended that anyone who uses illicit drugs carry naloxone. Nitazenes can last longer in the body than oxycodone, heroin and naloxone, meaning higher and repeated doses of naloxone may be required as well as hospital treatment. Teens need better protection from sex offenders: report Teenagers working alongside adults in Australia need to be better protected from sex offenders, a report says. The report into retailers has outlined a plan it hopes will ensure teens are not exposed to workplace predators across the country, AAP reports. The ‘‘Safety Not Guaranteed’ report by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and non-for-profit McKell Institute has recommended law changes to better protect children. The report found more than 500,000 children aged 17 and under were working across Australia mostly in retail but the majority were not adequately protected by law. It said only South Australia provided proper safeguards, after the state government passed laws in March banning child sex offenders from working with kids. The report has recommended other states and territories follow suit. It has called for legislation to be amended to ban accused and convicted sex offenders from working alongside children. The report also called for bail conditions to be tightened for convicted or accused sex offenders and reforms made to offender registries. The report said requirements for adults working alongside children were not strict in Australia. “Most Australians would be surprised to learn that there are few requirements for adults working alongside children to get ‘working with children’ checks,” it said. “This has led to incidences where adults charged, or even convicted, with child sex offences are working alongside children in retail, fast food and hospitality settings.” The report recommended that adults across the nation working alongside children be required to access the checks, in which they are screened for suitability. All states and territories should also ensure eligibility for “working with children” checks be expanded so that businesses voluntarily seeking them do so without a cost increase to workers. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on today’s blog – we’re nearly at the halfway point of this final sitting week, with two more jam-packed days ahead. But there’s still more to come this evening, so I’ll handover to Mostafa Rachwani to continue bringing you the latest. Take care. Explainer on Victorian government’s overhauled anti-vilification laws Earlier today, Benita Kolovos brought us news the Victorian government had unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the state’s anti-vilification laws. How will they change, and who will they protect? You can read her full explainer below: Gormon says Deloitte outlook ‘not government’s numbers’ Patrick Gorman was also asked to weigh in on the latest economic outlook from Deloitte – predicting a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year (see our earlier post). He answered that it’s “not the government’s numbers”: We understand that people will try and get the jump or guess what the numbers might be or in Deloitte’s case, modelling, but they are not our numbers. Gorman was asked whether the government has given up on increasing the tax rate on higher balanced superannuation accounts – as was promised a couple of budgets ago? Gorman said he couldn’t “tell you what decision the Senate will make over the next couple of days”. I wish I could. I wish we did not have a system where the opposition parties try to run things down until the last minute or the last hours of the Senate, but that is the system we have and we will see that play out on Wednesday and Thursday. But would you make it a number one item of debate on Wednesday morning? Gorman said “it remains part of our budget plan” but “we recognise the Australian people have given us a Senate that sometimes uses to prioritise things in different ways, and we have to work within that democratic system”. Labor MP welcomes passage of Help to Buy bill through senate The assistant minister to the PM, Patrick Gorman, is speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about the Greens’ concession to help Labor pass its housing bill. Asked if there were more deals to be cut, with a raft of legislation yet to make it through the Senate, he argued that these bills “stand on their own merits”. Of course people are frustrated that it took the Greens in particular so long, so much political gameplay, so many interviews with yourself and others about how they were here and in there and all over the place, finally it is done. As Paul Karp reports, the Help to Buy scheme – which passed the senate this afternoon – allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home or 40% for a new build for those who earn under the income thresholds of $90,000 for a single applicant, or $120,000 for a couple. The government share reduces the cost for the homebuyer, although it must be paid back upon sale. Temperatures climb towards 40C in parts of Sydney as power supplies remain tight Parts of Sydney have touched the 39C level forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology while sea breezes are so far keeping the CBD and other parts of the city’s east about 10C cooler. Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, chose to give a media conference at Canberra airport just before 2pm (AEST), to reassure the public that electricity suppliers were sufficient. Aemo had acted early to bring on generation capacity that was “potentially available” and to restore transmission lines, he said. (The latter was mostly to ensure NSW can import a lot of electricity.) Authorities were working to ensure generation remained adequate over the coming days, he said. As it happened, Aemo had issued another lack of reserve level 3 forecast at about noon (AEDT), implying that there was the possibility of “interruptible loads” now for Thursday at about 3.30pm (AEDT). As with previous LOR3 alerts, the market answered Aemo’s call, and the alert was cancelled at 1.54pm (AEDT) just as Westerman was wrapping up his slightly chaotic media conference (as some questioners phoned in questions he struggled to hear). Still, expect conditions to remain “tight” and hopefully no more of those ageing power units will conk out over the next couple of days. Nationals MP continues to voice concern over social media age ban Nationals MP Keith Pitt has been speaking to Sky News about his concerns regarding Labor’s under-16 social media ban bill. Yesterday, he became the latest to voice hesitation about the bill, joining his colleague Matt Canavan, the Greens and other Senate crossbenchers in alarm at the speed by which the bill is likely to be passed this week. Speaking just now, Pitt told the program: If you can’t actually fine anyone for not taking action [until 2026], then what difference will it make to take a few weeks to look at this in detail – this is one of the rare occasions I agree with my colleagues in the Senate where this is something that should be looked at more … My job as a backbencher is to make sure that people are doing this right. It’s not simply to trundle along and agree with everything that’s put before me. His main argument was that teenagers will be able to work around the ban – along with wanting more time to scrutinise the legislation. Analysis on government’s under-16s social media ban bill In case you missed it amid question time this afternoon, Josh Taylor has written a fantastic piece of analysis on the under-16s social media ban bill – asking why Labor is so intent on rushing it through? You can have a read of that below: Watch: China’s ambassador to Australia urges closer military ties Earlier today, China’s ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian spoke to reporters in Canberra and suggested Australia should do more to improve military ties with the People’s Liberation Army. We covered his remarks earlier in the blog, and you can now watch some of his remarks below, thanks to our video team: Going back to the under-16s social media ban, opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, says the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. We’ve asked Michelle Rowland’s office for comment but haven’t heard back yet. Coleman told the House of Representatives that the changes would be “significant improvements” to the bill. Firstly, the legislation will include a specific provision that nothing allows a social media to compel the provision of digital ID or government issued identity documents, such as passports, or drivers licenses. This is an important addition and further strengthens the privacy provisions in the legislation. Coleman said the second amendment was a clear power for the minister to specify steps which are not needed to be taken by social media companies to comply with the legislation – that is, the minister would be able to tell big tech what not to do in enforcing the age limit. With the use of identification documents now ruled out, supporters of the bill say platforms may look to biometric forms of age assurance, such as facial scanning, to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Coleman said: While the eSafety Commissioner will be responsible for formulating guidelines on what constitutes reasonable steps under the bill, the minister may direct that specific actions are not required in order for the platform to satisfy that reasonable steps test. This is also an important addition, as it allows the Minister to ensure that enforcement of the legislation is always appropriate and proportionate. With that, question time has wrapped up in the House of Representatives. Domestic violence payments The independent MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, is asking about the crisis payment for women leaving domestic violence – she said conditions exclude half the women who apply, and the payment is only available if a woman can show she fits the “narrow criteria” within seven days of leaving. Will the government review the conditions? The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, responded: While legislation requires that that person has seven days from the traumatic event to lodge a claim for crisis payment, there’s flexibility to support people in this circumstance. Services Australia provides an additional 14 days after contact to lodge a claim if they have experienced family and domestic violence. Notwithstanding that, we know as a government too often perpetrators of family domestic violence can exploit and manipulate government systems to control, harass, or threaten a current or former partner. Rishworth said the government would continue to look at the systems “across the board” on this. Liberal MP Henry Pike has asked another question along the lines of – how can Australians afford another three years of Labor? (The opposition has been finishing most of their questions with this line today). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded like he did with previous questions – by listing cost-of-living measures the government is taking, and criticising the opposition for voting against them. Because if things are free, apparently – according to the Liberal party philosophy – they’re not valued, which explains why you don’t support Medicare, and never have, why you don’t support public schools, and why you continue to just say what your against and not put anything forward constructively that will help. Just after Jim Chalmers wrapped up answering a dixer, the MP for Herbert Phillip Thompson was sent out under 94a. What is standing order 94a? You can have a read of this explainer for more information. Private health system accountability Independent MP Sophie Scamps has asked whether the government will support the call from the AMA for a private health system authority? She said her community is served by the only public-private partnership hospital in NSW, which recently terminated the contracts of private health insurers they believe are failing to adequately reimburse patients. The health minister, Mark Butler, said the sector had “suffered a price shock from Covid” amid other factors, “which impacts the business model of many hospitals and other things as well”. As a result, I asked the secretary of the department to conduct a health check on this sector – insurers, private hospital operators, [and] the AMA and patient groups were part of that. It was very constructive. I’ve published a version of that health check and asked the secretary to keep that forum going. It [will] discuss short-term options for reform of this sector soon, as well as long-term ideas that include the AMA idea, which they’ve been touting really for some time now, a different regulatory system. Question on food insecurity Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked the PM about growing rates of food insecurity. The minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, answered by listing measures the government has taken, and said: We will keep looking at all the ways that we can support people with cost of living, whether there’s that’s through emergency relief, food relief but importantly, through the cost-of-living measures, including tax cuts to every single taxpayer – something those opposite were never going to do. PM says opposition’s figures on insolvency are wrong The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked about the rate of business insolvencies. Anthony Albanese said the figures put forward by Ley – that more than 25,000 businesses have gone bust since Labor took office – are wrong. The minutes of the RBA’s monetary policy meeting [on] 24 September, said this – “The cumulative level of insolvencies was still below the pre-pandemic trend”. Who was in government pre-pandemic? … Those opposite. Labor ‘looking more like Whitlam government every day’: Dutton The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was up next to ask how Australian families and businesses “can possibly afford another three years of Labor”. He pointed to changes to the Future Fund, and said the Albanese government is “looking more like the Whitlam government every day”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded echoed earlier sentiments about the state of the economy when his government came to office, and the measures they have taken since. The fact is that the measures that we have introduced have all been opposed by those opposite … The difference between us and them is that they acknowledge people are under pressure, but want it to be worse. Albanese posed another question: how would any Australian have been better off under those opposite? They have no positive plans whatsoever, just reckless arrogance in their approach to the pressures that Australians are under. ‘They’re not’: Chris Bowen on why climate emissions are higher Greens MP Stephen Bates was next up to ask a question, asking the PM why climate emissions are higher under his government than when Scott Morrison went to office? The minister for climate change, Chris Bowen, responded that “they’re not”. That will be evident this week when we release the annual climate change statement, which is world’s best practice when it comes to accountability. Bowen also took aim at the opposition, saying: A government actually setting a clear policy agenda from the beginning, set by the Climate Change Act, supported by the safeguards reforms, supported by the new vehicle efficiency standards, supported by our capacity investment scheme, all of which has been done by this government – all of which has been opposed by the opposition, who want to stop all that while they wait for their nuclear fantasy to become a reality. Shadow treasurer asks question on latest Deloitte outlook The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question on the economy, pointing to the latest Deloitte outlook and changes to the Future Fund. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded by criticising the opposition’s economic track record: We have a plan for getting wages up. Increases, three of them, for people on the minimum wage. Remember back to the election campaign, Mr Speaker, when I took out that $1 coin and argued that a $1 coin, a $1 increase per hour … was something that we would support if the Fair Work Commission chose to do so. And those opposite said it would wreck the economy, the sky would fall in if that occurred. While taking a dixer on housing, the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, noted that Labor’s Help to Buy legislation had passed the Senate this afternoon. She said the government appreciates the support of those who voted in favour of the bill, “including the Australian Greens”. I’ve had a little bit of constructive criticism to offer the Greens in recent days, speaker, but let’s all agree, speaker, that at least the Greens are showing a modicum of interest in housing policy in this country. O’Neil said she had made “a number of attempts” to brief the shadow housing minister on “the policy offerings we’ve brought before this parliament”. It’s not that he can’t find the time to come to the briefings, speaker. He won’t even respond to our requests for a discussion. After a condolence motion for former Liberal minister John Hodges, question time has begun in the House of Representatives. First up is the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, asking about the latest financial outlook (from a Deloitte report, see earlier post). The prime minister said the government came to office “with a number of challenges that we were facing” – economic uncertainty, inflation and energy prices. He then listed a number of measures the government is taking, saying “they were all opposed by those opposite”. So certainly things, if they had’ve had their way, this reckless and arrogant opposition, things would have been worse. Just circling back to some comments Michael Sukkar made at the National Press Club, when asked if the Coalition would repeal Help to Buy if elected to government – noting this has just passed the senate. Sukkar backed repeal, and said: They’re terrible policies which is why we are in many respects, we’re unsurprised but dismayed that the Greens are now supporting it. On Build to Rent - the Greens have sold out ... they’ll vote with Labor to give preferential tax treatment to foreign corporates to own housing stock in this country for build to rent developments. We don’t think that the most beneficial tax arrangements for housing in this country should be the province of foreign fund managers ...As for the shared equity scheme, the fiddling while Rome burns, quite frankly, these schemes have been rejected by Australians and at a cost of $5.5bn - I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. Greens defer bid to dump Senate anti-abortion bill A Greens motion urging the Senate to discharge a controversial anti-abortion bill is being deferred until February, as the party focuses on negotiations with the government on a raft of stalled legislation in the final parliamentary week. Last week, Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters notified the Senate that she would move a motion today seeking to have the bill discharged. But Guardian Australia has been told the Greens have now opted to defer the motion until the parliament’s next sitting. The Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic that would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. It has been on the Senate notice paper for two years. But after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election, the Greens want the Senate to formally vote to remove the bill – something that would probably expose a split in the Coalition and possibly also Labor senators on what has traditionally been a conscience issue in the major parties. As expected, Labor’s housing bill has passed the Senate this afternoon, about 20 minutes ago. This comes after the Greens backed down on its concessions yesterday, and said it would help pass the legislation: Question time about to begin Question time is beginning in the House of Representatives in about five minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready – we’ll bring you all the key moments here on the blog. Cash says Dreyfus’ actions raise questions about independence of INSLM office Continuing from our last post, the shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash has told Guardian Australia that Mark Dreyfus’ actions raised questions about the independence of the INSLM office: The Attorney-General has extremely serious questions to answer. Mr Blight has confirmed that this alleged “ambiguity” was raised by the attorney’s office, and at one point was raised by the Attorney himself. To be clear, the “ambiguity” in question was a direct criticism of Mr Dreyfus. What did the Attorney think would happen? Does he seriously expect Australians to believe that he spoke to Mr Blight, pointed out the ambiguity, but expected nothing to happen? The Attorney needs to explain how this is a proper use of his power as Attorney-General. Mr Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC, who wrote the report, has been crystal clear that his report didn’t need “clarification”. What Attorney Dreyfus has done through his conduct is call into question whether our independent national security legislation monitor is truly independent. He needs to explain himself immediately. Opposition demands attorney general explain private talks with security watchdog The opposition is demanding the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explain a private discussion he had with Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) Jake Blight before Blight published a clarification to an old annual report that had criticised Dreyfus. As reported by Guardian Australia, Blight has confirmed that Dreyfus and one of his advisers separately raised concerns with him about what they argued was “ambiguity” in the watchdog agency’s 2022-23 annual report, which was produced by Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC. Blight has said he was neither asked nor directed to publish a clarification but that he decided to do so of his own accord. The clarification appeared in the 2023-24 annual report, published last month. Donaldson’s annual report contained criticisms of the federal government for failing to produce evidence in 2020 that was material to a court application by convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika opposing being subjected to a continuing detention order after his 20-year jail term ended in 2020. Donaldson discovered the evidence and made its existence public in 2022, prompting Benbrika to make another application – which ultimately succeeded. Donaldson’s annual report criticised the Department of Home Affairs for not providing the evidence to either Benbrika or the court in 2020 and the current attorney general, who inherited responsibility for the case after the 2022 federal election, for the fact that it was then only provided in full after a court order. It did not specifically mention the minister who had been responsible for home affairs at the time the evidence was first withheld, Peter Dutton. Donaldson said Dreyfus’s staff had raised “ambiguity” concerns with him before he finished his term as INSLM last year and that he had refused to change the report. We’ll bring you more on this in a moment. Greens won’t join race to ‘demonise migrants’ At the National Press Club, Max Chandler-Mather said the Greens wouldn’t participate in a “race to the bottom on who can demonise migrants more”, between the Liberals and Labor. Why is it every time there’s a crisis, that the rich and powerful in the major parties – backed by their big corporate donors – facilitate a debate in a race to the bottom in going after migrants? The Greens will not participate in that. We just won’t. The real solution to this is taking on those big corporations who are getting away with paying no tax, taking on those property investors and phasing out those tax handouts and getting back to a more fair and equitable system… He and Michael Sukkar just made their closing remarks, and the debate has wrapped up. Guardian asks Greens about their track record on housing supply Our own Paul Karp has asked about the Greens and Liberals track record on supply, and what commitment could they both give that at every level – federal, state and local – that their parties will be part of the solution and break their addiction to nimby votes? Max Chandler-Mather answered first, and said: I have been asked personally one time about what I thought about a social housing development in my electorate, and I wrote a letter supporting it. When we have written submissions on developments, our primary criticism is that a portion of that development is not being provided as social or affordable housing. Michael Sukkar responded next, and turned the lens on Labor instead: I would challenge you in one aspect – don’t give Labor state governments a leave pass for belatedly now trying to come up with solutions to a problem they created. He said many Australians living in the suburbs are very happy with some form of density, but “they shouldn’t be demonised for wanting to retain the essential character of the communities that they live in.” Max Chandler-Mather was asked why he hasn’t bought a home yet, and is still a renter, despite his earnings as an MP? He said he had a small, single-income family and gives up about $50,000 from his annual salary to fund a free meal program in his electorate: Because of that, giving up that money, and being on a single income and in an inner-city electorate with a very, very high median house price, it is actually sort of difficult at the moment to buy a house there. I want to be clear, though, I am not the one doing it tough – but I’m answering your question. Chandler-Mather says he doesn’t want to be a minister, prefers the crossbench Back at the National Press Club, the Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said he wouldn’t be defending Labor’s housing legislation – “and it is disappointing that the Labor housing minister isn’t here to defend them”. We’re not like the Liberals. We’re not just going to destroy, cut and block, and destroy any hope of actually fixing this housing crisis. We are trying to build public consensus for a large-scale action on this housing crisis. It has been our goal for the last few years, and indeed, for the entirety of the existence of the Greens. And I think that we’ve got some of the way there. Chandler-Mather was asked whether he would want to be a minister in a future minority government – noting Nick McKim was a minister in a Labor-Greens agreement in Tasmania. He responded: I think that personally, I would prefer to be on the crossbench and deciding on good pieces of legislation and pushing further after the next election. Dutton boosts Coalition MPs in final partyroom address Peter Dutton has told Coalition MPs that the Liberal and National parties are finishing the political year strongly, using his address to the final joint parties meeting for 2024 to rev them up ahead of an election year. Reminding them to focus on their electorates – citing the work of long-serving retiring MPs as an example – Dutton criticised the government’s priorities. The government is faltering and taking decisions that are making it even, even harder for families people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, but they also understand that if you get the economics right, you support families, and if you focus on what matters, that the country can get back on track. But you can only imagine what would happen under the chaos of a Greens Labor coalition. His deputy, Sussan Ley, urged MPs to maintain the “unity and discipline” over the summer, and determination to get things done, that they had shown in the past. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared that the next few days “indeed, the next few months” would determine the election result and when people’s credit card bills came rolling in around February, they should be reminded the pressure they felt was homegrown and “it wasn’t Vladimir Putin who created that problem”. The meeting was dominated by a lengthy debate on the government’s legislation to introduce a minimum age for social media use. The electoral reform bill, which the Coalition is supporting, was not discussed. Shadow housing minister says Liberals ‘unashamedly oppose’ Labor’s housing measures A reporter asked Michael Sukkar if the Coalition would repeal the Help to Buy and Help to Rent bills? He argued “these schemes have been rejected by Australians”, and said: I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. You don’t give any credit to the Labor party for coming up with new ideas – just like the housing minister couldn’t show up today to explain herself and the Labor party position. They have no ideas, no new policies … and that’s why we unashamedly oppose both of those measures, and will not do what the Greens have done, which is go back on all of the arguments and critiques [they made]. Sukkar and Chandler-Mather on how they would address labour shortage A reporter asked both Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Mather how they plan to address the labour shortage – with the former wanting to slash migration, and the latter wanting to build a large amount of public housing. Chandler-Mather pointed to the Greens’ push for a government-owned developer, which he said would signal to the construction industry how many homes need to be built. You can plan how many construction workers we need in that area and that area. The federal government used to employ architects and town planners and project managers in a genuine federal Housing Department, which is what we’re planning to establish. And Sukkar, responding to the question, said “the truth is that we need to rebalance our migration program”. Yes, we need less migrants, fewer migration from the rorted levels we’re at. By no means is the Coalition suggesting that we won’t have a healthy migration program, but it won’t be the reckless migration we’ve seen in recent years. Sukkar said “you don’t improve housing in this country by bringing in more yoga or fitness instructors” and argued that in this financial year alone only nine bricklayers were brought in. Shadow housing minister: ‘We’ll build more homes than Labor’ Labor has said that it has a target to build 1.2m new homes by the end of the decade – will the Coalition recommit to this goal if re-elected? At the National Press Club, shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar said that “we’ll build more homes than Labor”. It’s almost industry consensus now that not only will Labor not meet their 1.2m homes … they won’t get close, they’ll miss it by more than 400,000 homes. Around 800,000 homes is what the industry expects will be built based on the current trajectory, and may I add, that trajectory is still getting worse. So it could even be worse than 800,000. Some Coalition members may vote against the under-16s social media ban when it is voted on in parliament, with some 20 opposition members debating the online legislation in a marathon partyroom meeting this morning. The opposition “overwhelmingly” backed the bill, according to a party room spokesperson, but it’s understood a small handful spoke against it. Guardian Australia revealed recently that Matt Canavan and Keith Pitt, the Queensland Nationals members, had strong reservations about privacy elements of the bill. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke strongly for the bill, praising the campaigning of communications spokesperson David Coleman for pushing the issue as far as it has gone. The party room spokesperson said Dutton had negotiated “concessions” on the legislation, including an amendment to the legislation that would ensure there is no compulsion for people to hand over any form of government ID to social media platforms to verify their age. That’s understood to include drivers licenses and passports. About 19 Coalition members spoke in favour of the bill, but “two or three” spoke against it. At least one told the meeting they would vote against the legislation, while two others reserved their right to potentially vote against it. Chandler-Mather criticises Liberals for focus on migration amid housing debate Max Chandler-Mather has accused the Liberals of bringing up migration in the housing debate to “distract” from the fact the “real winners” are large property investors and the banks. He told the National Press Club: Of course the Liberals bring up migrants. Of course they do, because it is such a useful tool for them to distract from the fact that the real winners out of the housing crisis – the ones really hurting people right now – are the large property investors and the bank, and the property industry who benefit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. The Liberals were in power for nine years. What did they do? Give tax handouts to property investors, build less public housing than any government in Australian history since World War II, help to screw over renters. It is genuinely remarkable that the Liberals won’t take any responsibility for this housing crisis. It hardly gives me any confidence that they are going to be able to fix it. Shadow housing minister accuses Labor and Greens of being in a coalition The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has weighed in on the Greens’ capitulation to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy legislation, and said: The theatre of the Greens and Labor fighting in the parliament really betrays the truth, which is Labor and the Greens are in an unholy alliance – a Coalition. On housing, the government has repeatedly accused the Greens of working with the Coalition and Peter Dutton. Max Chandler-Mather addresses housing debate at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has wrapped up his opening remarks, and now the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather is up. He has told the National Press Club that “the barrier to fixing this housing crisis is not economic, it’s not technical – it’s political”. He argued Australia’s political system “has been corrupted by the power of the banking and property industry”, and said Labor and the Liberals “pursue policies that either push up house prices or give more money to property developers.” Chandler-Mather said today’s housing crisis can be linked to two changes in the 1990s – cuts to funding for public housing, and the introduction of capital gains tax by John Howard. Over the next 10 years, the Australian government will give property investors $176bn in tax handouts in the form of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. The housing crisis we find ourselves in right now is enormous but we can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. He is outlining measures the Greens would push for, including: Phasing out tax handouts such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, and using the money to create a government-owned property developer Develop new national tenancy standards, including long-term caps on rent increases A national renter’s protection authority to enforce the tenancy standards and issue fines to those who break the law Housing debate begins at National Press Club At the National Press Club in Canberra, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens’ housing and homelessness spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, are about to begin a debate. Club director Andrew Probyn told the crowd that the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, was also asked to appear but declined. Paul Karp flagged some details of what Sukkar will say, which you can read earlier in the blog here. We’ll bring you the key takeaways as the debate gets under way. Electricity strains ‘manageable’ but risks remain as mercury soars, Aemo says As we flagged last week, the arrival of sustained days of heat for eastern Australia (especially around Sydney) had authorities scrambling to make sure electricity supplies would suffice. The Australian Energy Market Operator has followed its usual procedure of sending out alerts and seeking a market response. What was unusual was the series of so-called level 3 lack of reserve notes for NSW, which implied the potential for blackouts if generators didn’t respond. (Cue some scary headlines.) Anyway, Aemo has issued a statement lately stating that “based on current forecast conditions”, they reckon reserves “are manageable” in NSW today despite the mercury climbing. (Parts of western Sydney are nudging 35C just now.) Still, Aemo doesn’t want to imply complacency: [Ongoing] heatwave conditions combined with significant generation outages in NSW tomorrow and Thursday remain a risk. Additional measures may be necessary if supply forecasts worsen due to unexpected generation or transmission outages, or if demand rises beyond current expectations. Nobody is being asked to reduce consumption – but for the sake of the planet (and our pockets) – why waste energy? Meanwhile, for Queensland “currently reserves are forecast to be manageable for tomorrow and Thursday”. Shorten said he thinks federal election is ‘winnable’ for Labor Bill Shorten also spoke about this morning’s caucus meeting, which will be his last – as he retired from politics next year to take up the role of vice chancellor at the University of Canberra. He told Sky News he has attended about 400 in his 17 years in politics. You know, they have on the wall pictures of all the former leaders. And I said, the only way that someone gets to have their picture on the wall is because of the faces in the room. And the Labor party, what it has, when … all the chips are down, is we have to learn to stick together. Shorten said he thinks the election is “winnable” but “it’s a contest.” What we think about when we get up in the morning as the government is ‘how do we help everyday Aussies?’. I think the opposition hasn’t done enough homework on their policy other than that sort of bizarre Soviet Union nuclear policy. Shorten lashes Greens over housing debacle Bill Shorten was also asked about the Greens’ backdown on its housing concessions – a rent freeze and negative gearing changes – to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy bill. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said earlier (see post) the party would wave Labor’s housing bills through and return to its fight at the next election. Speaking to Sky News, Shorten said he was pleased the bill was passed with a bit of “momentum” during the last week of parliament this year. The Greens have really, in my opinion, lost the plot. They have just been oppositionalist, and they’ve made the perfect the enemy of the good. I think the Greens think that, if they can sabotage Labor, then they can harvest our vote and say, ‘we should be the only really fair dinkum people because we’re so pure’. He argued the Greens’ “opposition mentality” was “turning people off”. Shorten says path to make NDIS long-term is ‘making sure we’re paying for outcomes’ The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has been speaking to Sky News about the NDIS. Speaking about art and music therapy funded through the scheme, he said “we are asking for some outcome for the dollars”. The path to making the scheme long term is to make sure that we’re paying for outcomes … What we want to do is focus on the participant. So this is a classic example. I like music therapy, I’ve seen it work where it demonstrates … it’s maintaining or improving highly disabled people’s functional capability. Great, keep charging. But if it’s something more as an activity, you can still charge at $68 bucks an hour, and if you’re getting four people in your class doing music or doing painting, $193 bucks, which is, I think, reasonable. Queensland opposition leader makes impassioned plea to government over truth-telling inquiry The Queensland opposition leader, Steven Miles, has made an impassioned plea to the government not to cancel the state’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry. Most of the Labor frontbench attended a rally outside parliament, for the first sitting day of the new government. Miles said the government was “refusing to listen” by ending the inquiry. I think that is a real shame. But the commitment I make to you, though, is that if you succeed, if you get your meeting, if you change his mind, if the truth-telling inquiry continues, then there will be nothing but praise from us. We will not criticise him [Crisafulli]. In fact, we will welcome it, because the truth is more important than politics and more important than point-scoring. The shadow minister for Closing the Gap and reconciliation, Leanne Enoch, also spoke at the rally and said: There is nothing to be afraid of in telling the truth. What is there to be afraid of? The data, the history, the evidence? There’s nothing to be afraid of. Truth-telling has happened all over the world, all over the world. Why can’t it happen here? Why can’t it happen here? The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, dismissed the protests this morning: There might be 150 protesters, but 5 million Queenslanders passed a vote on the 26th of October for the government to scrap [the path to a] treaty, and we have a mandate, and that’s what we’re going to do. He said the government could introduce repeal legislation as early as this week. LinkedIn tells parliamentary committee it is not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use it If you’re a social media platform trying to avoid having to verify the ages of your users, you might consider trying what LinkedIn has told a parliamentary committee: we’re not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use us. A few people on social media noticed a couple of months ago that one of the campaigns calling for the ban for under-16s had included the LinkedIn logo among the usual suspects of social media sites as an odd addition. LinkedIn has now told the parliament that it is definitely not a site teenagers want to use as it is “entirely professional” and “not popular with minors”. Additionally, LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors. As noted above, it is entirely professionally focused, providing members the ability to connect and engage on topics relevant to the world of work. Unsurprisingly, therefore, LinkedIn does not direct or market any of its products or features toward minors – including the 16 and 17-year-olds that are technically permitted on the platform – through content, design, marketing, or advertising. Human Rights Law Centre says under-16 social media ban bill raises constitutional concerns The Australian Human Rights Law Centre has said the bill to ban social media for under-16s raises constitutional concerns. In a submission, the centre says while not having sufficient time to fully consider the potential constitutional implications, “on its face, the bill burdens the implied freedom of political communication protected by the Australian constitution.” It imposes a blanket prohibition on those under 16 from accessing various social media platforms. In the modern era, social media platforms are one of the primary tools for political communication. It is likely to also burden the ability of all people in Australia to communicate, by potentially requiring any user of a social media platform to undertake age verification. Those over 16 may have legitimate reasons for being concerned about consenting to age verification. There are real questions about whether such a burden is proportionate to the purpose of protecting children from online harm. We would encourage the committee to seek further input regarding the constitutional validity of the Bill. The centre is one of many of the submissions to the inquiry recommending against the bill being passed in its current form. Elon Musk’s X also yesterday said there were questions around the lawfulness of the bill. More information on Victorian anti-vilification bill Just circling back to the earlier news that Victorian Labor would introduce an anti-vilification bill to the state parliament today: The state attorney general Jaclyn Symes says the bill retains current exceptions in the law that protect activities done for genuine religious, academic, artistic, public interest or scientific reasons. It also protects people “genuine and legitimate religious activities, such as worshipping, practising, proselytising and teaching religion”. She said: We want to make it clear that what you believe … what you what your religion stands for, is unaffected by this bill. It can’t be used as a cloak for unabated abuse. But in relation to what people believe, what they talk about, what they teach. Religion is important. Your ability to practice your religion free of hate is protected in this bill. The bill also introduces a new “political expression” defence for the criminal incitement offence, to protect political communication. Greens still negotiating with government over Nature Positive environmental legislation On the issue of legislation still stalled in the Senate, and as the clock is ticking on the end of the parliamentary year, the Greens are still negotiating with the government over its Nature Positive environmental legislation after dropping their demand that climate impact be included among the assessments for development projects. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, had talks with minister Tanya Plibersek yesterday but they have not yet reached a compromise. It is likely there will be further talks today as the government seeks to clear its legislative logjam. Australia and China have ‘interdependent’ economies: Chinese ambassador Back at his press conference, the Chinese ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian has described the economies of each country as “interdependent”. He said: We are two big economies. We are so much – let me use the word – interdependent. I don’t think it’s a negative word. The Chinese and Australian economies are strongly connected with each other. Our two economies are interwoven with each other. In a certain sense … we are interdependent with each other. China is the major importer from Australia, and Australia relies on China as its biggest market. And no other country can single-handedly take the place of China in this respect. And we do not see any other country can take the place of Australia. So we have confidence that, as we manage our relationship, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship. Labor has held its last caucus meeting for the parliamentary year. Anthony Albanese thanked a number of MPs and senators: Michelle Ananda-Rajah, whose seat of Higgins is being abolished but is contesting the Senate at the number 3 spot; senator Anne Urquhart, who is contesting the lower house seat of Braddon; Brian Mitchell, who stood aside to let former Tasmanian opposition leader Rebecca White run in Lyons; and Catryna Bilyk, who is retiring. Albanese noted the Greens had changed their position on Labor’s housing bills, saying their party had “folded in on itself” and this is “hopefully the first of many” bills to be passed this week. He took aim at Peter Dutton, for opposing government bills to prevent privatisation of the NBN, introduce a power to cap student numbers, and extend free Tafe. The prime minister said he would leave “nothing on the field” when it came to ensuring Labor stayed in majority government after the next election. On the social media age ban, communications minister Michelle Rowland said it was important to know that social media companies cannot compel people to hand over their ID. She noted while it is good that opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is on board it was concerning that their party room was split. A long list of legislation was approved: on authorising surcharges charged by commonwealth entities; the Future Made in Australia production tax credits; and the migration prohibited items bill. Chinese ambassador: ‘No reason for us to compromise our respective national interests’ Does Xiao Qian have any concerns that Donald Trump’s election in the US will alter or undermine the stabilised Australia-China relationship? He responded that “there is no reason for us to compromise our respective national interests for the sake of a third party.” We are responsible for our own people, the Australian government is responsible for Australian people. We have common ground and this has been the foundation for a good relationship over the decades, bringing so many benefits to our two countries and peoples and there are reasons to responsibly manage our relationship bilaterally so our people can benefit. On the US, as he mentioned a moment ago, the ambassador said “we are still in a transition period … so perhaps we need to be a little patient until the new administration comes into office … to see what bilaterally we can do between China and the US”. Ambassador says China respects ‘the choice of the American people’ Xiao Qian was asked about the incoming Donald Trump administration, and how this may impact trade. He said China “respect[s] the choice of the American people”, and the relationship between China and the US “is now in transition”, with Biden and Xi meting on the sidelines of Apec. Bilaterally, as ambassador in Australia, what I can say at this moment is I expect China and the United States to engage with each other to talk about each other’s policies on how to manage our relationship … at the proper time for them when the new administration comes into office in January. Asked about the Australia-China relationship, Xiao Qian said “we are in a very good shape – also at a very critical period of time”. We experienced a difficult time for several years until two years ago and since then we have been successfully changing that situation. The year of 2022 was a year of stabilisation. President Xi [Jinping] met with prime minister Anthony Albanese, they agreed to define the relationship … And the year of 2023 was a year of immense improvement, a lot of bilateral meetings … dialogues and consultations. That year was highlighted by prime minister Albanese’s visit to China. He said that 2024 has been a year of “consolidation” and “symbolised a complete turnaround of the relationship”. With efforts from both sides we have successfully turned around the relationship through the two years … Looking forward into the future, we are expecting – at least I am expecting – a move beyond stabilisation, moving further into development because we have so many areas that we share, contributing to the fundamental interests of our two countries. Chinese ambassador calls for Australia to support ‘One China’ policy The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has been speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in Canberra. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a province of China … I hope the Australian side would respect China’s sovereignty and practice its commitment of the One China policy in words and deeds, and to support openly the peaceful reunification of China. Rabbi welcomes new anti-vilification laws in Victoria Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann has welcomed the laws, describing today as a “great day for all Victorians”. It doesn’t matter whether you wear a kippa or a hijab, if someone vilifies you, if someone wants to go after you, your faith, your background, your belief, your sexuality, the chances are that they will be charged and go to jail or be heavily fined. We all become safer. Sadly, what we have seen on the streets the CBD and around Victoria is people feeling emboldened lately to go after minority groups to go after Jews, to go after people from the Islamic community, members of the LGBTQI+ community, people with a disability – they feel that they can get away with vilifying bigotry, racism, all types of phobias. Today the Allan government says enough is enough. He is urging other religious leaders to support the reforms, and said: There’s been a little bit of chatter about the religious community. I’m an orthodox rabbi. I teach the Hebrew Bible scripture. I know the different nuances within it, but I also know that as a religious person, someone with fundamental beliefs, that we are all equal in the eyes of God. We all created in the image of God, and that means honouring, respecting people, of people, religion, beliefs, sexualities and the like. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the bill has been years in the making, and that she’s undergone significant consultation with the community over two years: These laws are for the Muslim woman who told me she was scared to get on public transport because she was wearing hijab … These laws are for the parents of Jewish kids, who are not allowed to come into the CBD anymore because they are scared that when they wearing their uniform or they have a Star of David necklace or a kippa on, because their parents are scared they attacked because of the rising antisemitism. These laws for the young man who told me, because he’s queer, he has to take time out from school because he’s viciously bullied because of who he is and what he looks like. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that will be introduced to parliament today. There are plenty of details in the bill, but the main element will be to expand the state’s existing legal protections against vilification – which currently only cover race and religion – to cover disability, gender identity, sex and sexual orientation. It also protects people with a personal association with a person who has a protected attribute, such as being the parent of a disabled child. The bill will also create two criminal offences to be contained in the Crimes Act, to respond to serious vilification: It will be an offence to incite hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group based on their protected attribute. It will be an offence to threaten physical harm or property damage against a person or a group based on their protected attribute. They will apply when incitement or threats occur in Victoria in any context – private, public or online. Party room meetings taking place Party room meetings have been taking place this morning in Parliament House. They are held every Tuesday during sitting weeks, and with so much legislation left to address and only three sitting days left, they could prove quite important. There’s an off-the-record briefing after each party room meeting, and my colleagues here in Canberra will bring us the key takeaways as we learn more. Circling back to news that the Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight: O’Brien is holding a press conference at state parliament after being selected as Victoria Nationals leader, saying the party would retain “our laser-like focus on the interests of rural and regional Victoria going forward.” Particularly at the moment when we’ve got a terrible government that is very city centric and focused on the urban areas, at the expense of rural and regional Victoria. After the 2022 election, O’Brien said his party should review its agreement with the Liberals. But today, he said the Coalition was strong: The Coalition remains very strong and will continue to remain very strong under my leadership. John Pesutto is doing a fantastic job in turning around the fortunes of the opposition and making sure that come 2026 that Victorians will have a strong alternative to the current terrible Labor government. And I’m very pleased and very strongly committed to ensuring that that Coalition continues to ensure that we get rid of this very bad Labor government. Asked what would happen to the agreement if the Liberals decide to dump Pesutto as Liberal leader, O’Brien dismissed the question as a hypothetical. He confirmed his predecessor, Peter Walsh, will step down from his shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs but said the party’s position on treaty wouldn’t change. O’Brien said there would be a shuffle of portfolios shortly, with upper house MP Melina Bath to be elevated to shadow cabinet. It’s just the first sitting day of Queensland’s new Liberal National government. But as new MPs are sworn in inside the parliament building, hundreds of protestors have rallied outside. Signs demand the government abandon its plans to repeal a plan to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous Queenslanders and end an inquiry into colonialism. One sign reads: What are you afraid of? The truth? Most of the frontbench of the Labor opposition is attending, including opposition leader Steven Miles. Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Green to debate housing at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, will debate at the National Press Club today. And it might actually be a debate now the Greens have decided to pass Labor’s housing bills (which the Coalition oppose). In an advance copy of Sukkar’s speech, the shadow minister is long on the problems in the housing market but a bit shorter on the solutions. On the problems, he says: First home buyer loans have plummeted from 171,218 in 2020–21 under the Coalition to just 108,599 in 2022–23. Home completions dropped to 177,185 last year—40,000 fewer than the 216,707 under the Coalition in 2016–17. Approvals for new homes have also crashed, falling to 167,287 over the past year, compared to 233,247 when the Coalition was in government. Meanwhile, national median rents have skyrocketed by 23%, reaching $632 per week from $512 in May 2022. Labor’s promise to build 1.2m homes over five years will never see the light of day, with industry experts predicting a shortfall of over 400,000 homes. On solutions, Sukkar promises: a “a comprehensive package” to tackle barriers to getting a loan to “make homeownership more achievable for all Australians”; a $5bn fund for enabling infrastructure; and a freeze on changes to the national construction code. He will conclude: Australians can continue to expect a Coalition government will be singularly focussed on home ownership. We are the only party that still believes in the Australian Dream, which is why the individual, not the institution, is the centre of our focus. We are the only party fighting for the Dream because home ownership has always been a Liberal value and something Labor has never signed up to. Australians deserve action, not spin, and housing - without a doubt - will be a defining issue at the next election. ‘Silent majority’ of Australian farmers found to support renewable energy transition Seventy per cent of regional Australians in renewable energy zones support the development of renewable energy projects on local farmland, a new survey has found. The survey, conducted for lobby group Farmers for Climate Action, found that support for renewable energy developments increased to 73% for people connected to the farming industry, but was conditional on concerns around consultation, project design and decommissioning being met. Just 17% of respondents said they opposed renewable energy developments, with 8% strongly opposed. For more details on the survey, you can read our full report below: Human Rights Commission to launch its anti-racism framework today This evening, the Australian Human Rights Commission will launch what it’s calling “the most comprehensive plan ever for addressing racism” in Australia. The anti-racism framework will “provide a roadmap for governments, business and community organisations to eliminate racism in Australia in all its forms”, it said in a statement. The framework has been developed with funding from the Australian government, and will be launched by Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman in Western Sydney this evening. University vice-chancellors face pay scrutiny The Australian is reporting that university vice-chancellors could have their pay pegged to other public servants’. That would no doubt be music to the ears of struggling students and the National Tertiary Education Union, but sadly the effect of upcoming governance reforms might have been slightly overstated. In April, education ministers agreed to set up an expert governance council for universities. One of its 10 priorities is to: Demonstrate and maintain a rigorous and transparent process for developing remuneration policies and settings for senior university staff, with consideration given to comparable scale and complexity public sector entities, and ensure remuneration policies and packages are publicly reported. As far as we can tell this might mean that there is more scrutiny on pay, but as long as universities have policies, consider the relativity of pay and are transparent in the way pay is set, they are largely free to continue giving generous remuneration. Nevertheless, perhaps modest pay could catch on. After all, the Western Sydney University vice-chancellor George Williams took a 20-25% pay cut relative to his predecessor and government services minister, Bill Shorten, has asked to be paid less than $1m when he starts his new gig at the University of Canberra. Victorian gaming minister outlines changes to state’s poker machine rules The Victorian gaming minister, Melissa Horne, has just run through the changes she will be introducing to parliament today to set up mandatory carded play on poker machines. Speaking outside parliament, she said $3bn was lost by Victorians every year through poker machines: But at the same time, we’ve got less than 10% of the population playing poker machines. This is less people than ever before but they’re losing more than ever before. And where people are losing the most money is in our lowest socio economic areas. So there’s something wrong. Horne said carded play will begin with a pilot at 40 pubs and clubs across the state in the middle of next year, before it is rolled out in 2026. She says it will become mandatory across all venues by 2027. So next year, it’s about doing the pilot and then evaluating the technology. Because unlike Crown casino, which is a single venue that’s got the same technology, we’ve got more than 500 different venues across the state, and the technology varies from machine to machine. We’re making sure that we get that technology piece right so that it’s easy for people to sign up to – that’s really important. But it’s the pilot next year then over 2026 is rolling out the card at play then this mandatory by 2027 which lines up with the new monitoring licence. The Australian Human Rights Commission has said the bill to ban under-16s from social media should not pass in its current form. The commission said while there are online harms and social media can have a negative impact, it provides opportunities for children and young people to access criticall potentially life-saving information and to share ideas and opinions. Social media also offers children and young people opportunities for inclusion and participation that are particularly important for children and young people from marginalised, vulnerable or remote communities, including children with complex needs and disability. The ban would have unintended consequences and negative human rights impacts, the commission said, not just for children and young people but the broader Australian community. Given the importance of this issue, the risks around negatively impacting children and young people’s rights and the unreasonable timeframes for analysing and commenting on the bill, the bill should not be passed in its current form. SQM Research has released its annual housing update that says Sydney and Melbourne housing prices are likely to continue to record moderate price falls of between -1% and -5%. The base forecast for average national dwelling prices is expected to rise between +1% to +4%. Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin are expected to outperform the national housing market, it found, with Perth forecast to record the fastest dwelling price rises of between 14% to 19%. Meanwhile, Canberra is due to record the largest falls in dwelling prices of between -6% to -2%. SQM Research is also forecasting an interest rate cut between 0.25% and 0.50% over mid 2025 – which it says would “immediately stimulate homebuyer demand across the country [and] limit the year-on-year dwelling prices falls recorded for our two largest capital cities.” Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said: To be sure, our two largest capital cities, along with Canberra and Hobart will start 2025 off in the red. Indeed, we are currently recording dwelling price falls in each of these cities … However, once interest rate cuts do occur, we are expecting a speedy bounce in demand for Sydney and Melbourne in particular, which both are still experiencing underlying housing shortage relative to the strong population growth rates … However, if I am wrong and rate cuts do not occur in 2025, it is unlikely a recovery will occur in Sydney and Melbourne at any time next year. Previous coverage on the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women There’s been a fair bit of talk this morning about the government’s response to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, has covered this inquiry extensively over the past three years. In August, when the inquiry’s report was handed down, she spoke with the Full Story podcast about the need for reform: And you can have a read of all our previous articles on this topic here. The sports minister, Anika Wells, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning about gambling reform. (You can read her earlier comments to ABC RN about this, here). Wells was asked why the government has acted so quickly on the under-16 social media ban, but not on gambling reform? She responded: The social media ban is about trying to protect kids as quickly as we can, and also to give parents the tools to empower them in conversations. It’s a lot easier to say to your kids, ‘The government has said that they can’t guarantee you’re safe online, that’s why you and your friends are not allowed to go on the platforms anymore.’ Gambling advertising has financial impacts for professional codes, national sporting organisations, impacts to us with respect to sporting integrity on the world stage and what we do on the world stage. She was asked: doesn’t gambling have just as many consequences for young people and their mental health when they get caught up in these addictions? Wells responded by pointing to action the government has already taken. NT authorities need to take domestic violence ‘more seriously’, Nampijinpa Price says The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier about the NT coroner’s inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women. Asked for her reflections on what the coroner found, Price told the program: There has been a desensitisation from the coroner towards the rates of domestic and family violence that we certainly experience in the Northern Territory, and this has occurred over some time now. I also feel as though there is an attitude in … dealing with family violence and interpersonal violence in Indigenous communities that it is in some way, you know, taboo to have an open and honest conversation about the fact that we experience the high rates, so as not to demonise our men. Price argued there was a “need for our authorities and police force to tackle it more seriously”, and that calls to remove police from communities wasn’t helpful. I have faith in the Country Liberal party government to be able to deliver on those recommendations, and with that funding that’s available. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. The party met this morning to vote O’Brien in as leader, with Lowan MP Emma Kealy to remain deputy leader. O’Brien said in a statement following the vote: It is the greatest honour to have been elected as leader of The Nationals. For over 100 years, The Nationals have served the interests of rural and regional Victoria. That will not change. It remains our singular focus as the only party solely dedicated to serving the interests of the 25% of the population who live outside the metropolitan area. Walsh had been in the leadership role for a decade and it remains unclear whether he will stick around on the backbench. The Greens’ housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather spoke with ABC RN earlier, about the party’s backdown on its concessions on the Help to Buy legislation. He argued the Greens were “really close” to achieving its concessions around a rent freeze and negative gearing changes, and that the government “were actively considering it”. It is bitterly disappointing that Labor, in the end, blinked and didn’t decide to come to that policy. But I haven’t lost hope, because I think we can go to the next election with those policies, and I think we can push Labor after that next election. Is this an act of electoral self-preservation? Chandler-Mather disagreed, and echoed comments from party leader Adam Bandt earlier that “it comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can.” I would point out that we have now passed every single bit of Labor’s housing legislation this term of parliament. We have tried to negotiate and secure good outcomes. Chandler-Mather is due to speak at the National Press Club in Canberra today, alongside shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar. TikTok has warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a “licence to be online” because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The company’s director of public policy in Australia, Ella Woods-Joyce, pointed to comments made by the communications department in Senate estimates earlier this month confirming that “everybody will have to go through an age verification process”. As the government’s admissions in Budget Estimates make clear, age-restricted social media platforms will need to undertake age assurance for each and every Australian user in order to remove age-restricted users from their services. This effectively creates a mechanism whereby Australians need a ‘licence to be online’. Woods-Joyce said there are many questions about the trial of the age assurance technology, which won’t be completed before the government pushes to pass the bill. Given the impact of mandating that all Australians who wish to use social media platforms be subject to such an age assurance system, we urge Parliament to consider the broader implications of legislating such an outcome without knowing any details of the system itself. We’re getting more submissions to the one-day inquiry on the bill, up to 93 out of the more than 15,000 submissions now public. You can read more of the submissions below. Rishworth says Coalition opposition to social media ban ‘all about politics’ The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has taken aim at those in the opposition speaking against the under-16s social media ban. Earlier in the blog, we brought you her comments that this was a leadership test for Peter Dutton, as people in the party ‘defy’ him. Speaking at a doorstop at Parliament House, Rishworth was asked whether the government will allow amendments if the Coalition moves that passports and licenses can’t be requested for ID. She responded: Of course, we want to work across the board to make sure that there is strong privacy protections in place. But quite frankly, this seems to me like this is all about politics and about negativity. Now I shouldn’t have been surprised. This is not the first time that Peter Dutton has said he supports something and then has decided to destroy. The Labor party is trying to build, while he has become a blocker. So I shouldn’t be surprised that he says he 100% supports something, wants to see it delivered, and then decides to block it and play politics with it. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, spoke to ABC News Breakfast earlier about Labor’s housing legislation and said “there comes a point where you’ve pushed as hard as you can”. He was asked whether the Greens’ backdown on its concessions around rent freezes and negative gearing was “humiliating”, and responded: We tried really hard to get Labor to act on soaring rent increases and unfair tax handouts that are tilting the playing field against first-home buyers, but we couldn’t get there this time. Bandt argued that the Greens “led the charge” on the stage-three tax cuts and were “hopeful” they could get the government to shift on key housing measures: We got close. The government was costing changes to negative gearing and they decided to back down at the last minute, and that’s disappointing. But, look, there comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can. The government’s made its decision about defending the status quo. What we’ll now do is wave the bills through, and take this challenge up to the next election … I’m hopeful that, in the next parliament, if we keep Peter Dutton out, we can push the government to make some much-needed reforms. Albanese government announces panel members for review of national electricity market As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid faces a couple of days of strains in New South Wales and Queensland as power demand picks up along with temperatures. (About 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plant capacity is offline for maintenance too, which isn’t helping.) Anyway, the Albanese government is looking a bit over the horizon, announcing the panel members for a post-2030 review of the national electricity market (basically all of Australia save the NT and WA grids). The review will be chaired by Tim Nelson, a former AGL Energy expert. He’ll be joined by Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Ava Hancock, who helped designs NSW’s renewable energy roadmap, and Phil Hirschhorn, who was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. The terms of reference of the review will be key but the details are apparently scant on that front. The federal and state energy ministers may fill in some of the blanks when they meet (some in person, some virtually) for their final gathering of 2024 at the end of next week. The panel will examine the wholesale market settings “to ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond”, the office of energy minister Chris Bowen said. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system. The results of the review are likely to land after next year’s federal election – let’s see if Bowen will lead the charge of implementing its recommendations. McCarthy calls for change in how media reports on First Nation deaths On the media’s role in covering the deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, Malarndirri McCarthy said the Senate inquiry heard that “First Nations families felt they weren’t believed, felt they weren’t heard, and felt that they were completely ignored”. This must change. I’ve certainly written to the Australian Press Council. I’ll be calling on fellow senators to assist me with media across the country. There has to be a change in the culture of the media, in the reporting, in the way it’s reported. Government notes ‘large number’ of recommendations from inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women Going back to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women – which the government responded to late last night – Malarndirri McCarthy told the program the government had “noted a large number of the recommendations”. What I’ll continue to do is meet with those Indigenous affairs ministers, as I’ve done recently, to ensure that we continue to keep working in this space. McCarthy said they had advertised for a Children’s Commissioner for First Nations youth and children, and “we hope to have that up and running in January.” Host Bridget Brennan said she had heard responses on two recommendations, but the government had “noted” eight others – what does it mean, will the government be looking at enacting them? McCarthy responded: For example, when we look at the jurisdictions around police – well, of course that will be up to the attorney general to work at the state level with the police jurisdictions. It will be up to each of those jurisdictions to then follow through. We can’t enforce it. But we can make sure we have those conversations. So it doesn’t mean we don’t agree, is what I’m saying. McCarthy urges NT government to act after inquest into four Indigenous deaths Yesterday, the Northern Territory government has been told it must overhaul its response to family violence to stop women and children being killed. As Nino Bucci reported, the NT coroner yesterday handed down inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, making 35 recommendations: The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss this, and said it was an “important moment” for the NT and Australia to “realise that this is a national scourge that we have across our country.” She called on the NT government to “immediately” release funding to address the recommendations. This is too critical. We know that, from a federal perspective, that there was a requirement to assist the family and domestic violence sector in the Northern Territory. And I urge the Northern Territory government to do that immediately. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was on ABC RN earlier to discuss the rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women – after the government handed down its response to the Senate inquiry yesterday. McCarthy labelled the findings “horrific” – with Indigenous women making up 16% of Australia’s murder victims, while being just 2-3% of the adult population. There is something in the system in Australia that seems to just go, ‘that’s OK’, you know, but it’s not OK. It’s not OK … People who work in the family and domestic violence sector … break down because they feel that the system isn’t changing. And I do believe that the work of this Senate inquiry has certainly brought it to the forefront for the Australian parliament, to the point where the Australian prime minister brought all the premiers and chief ministers together to say enough … at the national level. McCarthy said there would “always be an expectation for more to be done”, and that state and territory’s will be tasked to take things back to their cabinets to work on. Sports minister on gambling ad reform: government ‘remains committed’ to all 31 recommendations Labor’s plans for gambling ad reform has been delayed until next year – despite commitments made from the minister there would be a response by Christmas. Josh Butler had more on the timeline of this in yesterday’s blog, here. The aged care and sports minister, Anika Wells, was asked about this on ABC RN earlier, and said the government “remain[ed] committed” to working through the 31 recommendations of the inquiry. Right now, we’re working through 31 recommendations with all of the different stakeholders in this space … As a sport minister who always tries to be athlete-led, there are athletes who are being targeted by the rise of gambling and the proliferation of gambling advertising, not just in professional clothes now, but in the junior leagues we’ve seen those stories come out. So it is something that we’re working through … These are complex but important reforms, and I look forward to continuing to work on them. Wells was asked about the role lobbyists are playing in trying to stop reform – but she said “I wouldn’t characterise it that way at all.” I think, and if you look at the public remarks that codes have made along this journey, they agree that something needs to be done. It’s about finding something that’s workable, that everybody can live with, and that won’t impact the financial models … Peter V’landys absolutely is one of the players in this area, but there’s lots more, and we’ve got to work through the nuances and concerns of all of them, and that’s why we’re going to continue to do that. On the under-16s social media ban, we’ve now got at least three Nationals – Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and now Bridget McKenzie – and Liberal MP Garth Hamilton publicly voicing concerns over the rushed nature of the bill and potential privacy or access issues for all Australians. The Coalition partyroom is meeting this morning, where the ban is expected to be a hot topic of conversation. But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said at a brief press gallery doorstop that he was in favour of the ban broadly, and indicated most of the Coalition still backed it: I think the process is troubling, and there are issues here, but ultimately, we think that this is a proportionate approach to what is a very serious issue in the community. This is something that Peter [Dutton] has given very lengthy comments on the record about, and that is our position. The report of the lightning-quick inquiry, which only held a short three-hour hearing, will be released this afternoon. We hear there may be more than a few amendments to the bill proposed. However even critics of the bill are expecting the Coalition will ultimately back the ban. Watch this space. Hot days to strain eastern Australia’s power grid for next few days The slow-moving heatwave across southern and south-eastern Australia will nudge temperatures in Sydney’s west towards 40C today and tomorrow. Sydney’s eastern suburbs will be spared the worst, though, with sea breezes keeping the mercury to temperatures in the low 30s for the next three days. Most of eastern New South Wales will endure low- to severe-intensity heatwave conditions today. NSW’s power grid faces the most strain, although Queensland too will have periods when reserves will be relatively tight. (That is, better not have any unplanned outages at the ageing coal-fired power plants ... or any generators for that matter.) The Australian Energy Market Operator this morning cancelled the latest of its so-called lack of reserve level 3 alerts (this one for Wednesday), which imply blackouts unless the market responds. (The market usually responds.) Still, wholesale power prices will near their maximum levels in NSW later today on present Aemo forecasts: A couple of nervous days ahead for our power authorities. And if you’re feeling the heat, drink lots of water, find a cool place and look out for your neighbours to ensure they’re doing OK too. Canavan says he is drafting amendments to under-16 social media bill Despite his pushback to the under-16s social media ban bill, Matt Canavan told ABC RN he hadn’t made his mind up yet on whether he would support the legislation. I’m going to obviously talk to my colleagues in the party room this morning. I am in the process of drafting a number of amendments to the bill, and I’ll have more to say about that in the committee’s report, which will be tabled today. I’ll just keep watching and listening to the debate, but I certainly think the bill needs major changes, and regardless of the changes, I remain unimpressed with this condensed timeframe to analyse the bill. Canavan said there was “widespread support” for legislation like this, and “I don’t think that support is going to somehow disappear over the summer break”. We can I think just pause here, come back and do this properly. Canavan concerned about digital ID for age assurance: ‘All we’ve got is the minister’s word’ The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has said a digital ID framework would not be used for age assurance – does this response alleviate Matt Canavan’s privacy concerns? Canavan argued there was nothing to stop the future use of digital identity to maintain social media accounts: So all we’ve got is the minister’s word, which, as I say, doesn’t mean anything. She might not be the minister within a year – who knows? So why not, if the minister is is being legitimate here … why not just change the act, change the bill to rule it out? He again took aim at the rushed process, saying senators hadn’t “been able to get across some important submissions” and that it would have been good to have social media companies themselves front the inquiry: We only had time yesterday to hear from their industry representative body but many colleagues of mine – including those who support the bill – are frustrated that the industry group could not answer their questions because their questions went to the particular behaviours of the likes of X or Meta … The bill doesn’t even come into effect until 2026, next year. So why not take a breath, extend the inquiry [and] allow us to get across these 15,000 submissions. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan is speaking with ABC RN about the government’s under-16 social media ban. He’s been an outspoken critic against the bill, and told the program “it’s just not acceptable” how rushed it has been. I completely understand the need [to address] significant harms done to young children from the overuse and abuse of social media, but given [that a bill of this kind is] unprecedented it’s just not acceptable to the public. He said the hurried inquiry into the bill received 15,000 submissions and the committee would report today. It’s very important to let people know this … won’t just affect the use of social media for people under 16, because once you have to try and verify someone’s age under 16 you’re going to have to verify everyone’s age to check their age. And so there’s huge privacy, free speech implications of this legislation. O’Neil says government doing ‘everything we can’ to ease economic pressures Asked about the latest economic outlook, Clare O’Neil said she wasn’t denying how tough it is for Australians, and said: You’re seeing the same problems with the economies in the US and all over the world. She pointed to tax cuts and energy bill relief: I’m not saying any of these things completely take the pain away, but I want people to know that government is on your side. We’re doing everything we can to try to relieve those [real] pressures that you’re feeling. Rent freeze and negative gearing changes ‘dead in the water’, O’Neil says The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, just spoke with the Today show about Labor’s housing bills – and the Greens’ decision to back its Help to Buy bill after failing to win its concessions. O’Neil said that the Greens’ calls for a rent freeze and negative gearing changes are “absolutely dead in the water, because they were never good ideas to begin with”. We have sought to be really constructive in this parliament, but it turns out you’ve got to push pretty hard to get your housing initiatives through. O’Neil said the bill was “not a silver bullet” but it was “never meant to be”, but warned people against “the snake oil salesmen in this housing debate who are pretending that there’s one thing we can do to fix the whole problem”. The truth is, we’ve had a generations-in-the-making housing crisis in our country that’s been building for more than 30 years, and it requires our government to do lots of things differently. We’re trying to build many more homes in our country, we’re trying to get a better deal for renters, and we’re trying to get more Australians into homeownership. It’s a big, complex program and it’s going to take some time. But I really want your viewers at home to know that we understand that Australians are in real housing distress at the moment, and our government is stepping up and taking action. ‘We can do better than that’: Zoe Daniel on Labor’s social media ban bill Zoe Daniel argued that the problem with Labor’s social media is that “you’re basically letting the platforms off the hook”. [We need to] get the platforms to take responsibility for what is in their environment – and actually, it would make an age ban redundant if we were to put in this kind of safety by design, and a duty of care and hold the platforms accountable for what’s happening in their spaces. You wouldn’t actually need an age ban. Daniel said she had spoken with communications minister Michelle Rowland about the issue, and the government has flagged it would “go down the track of a duty of care eventually”. The independent MP said she “understood” why the government was pursuing the age ban “because it is a lever to pull now and it makes parents feel better”, but argued it “actually makes zero difference to what is happening on the platforms”. The onus and the responsibility remains on the parents and the kids, and I think that we can do better than that. The independent MP Zoe Daniel was on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss her alternative to the under-16 social media ban, which she introduced as a private member’s bill yesterday. Daniel said her bill would implement an overarching statutory duty of care on social media companies “that goes to safety by design – but that in and of itself is not enough”. What you need to make that work is the companies to assess the risks, mitigate the risks, be transparent about how they’re doing that. The bill builds in penalties so if the companies do not comply, they could be fined up to 10% of global revenue. Also, their onshore executives could be held accountable for that … and the bill also has a provision to enable users to have control over the algorithm, as exists overseas, particularly in the EU … The final provision is that when you enter a social media platform for the first time, your default privacy position is defaulted to the strongest possible settings. McKenzie cites privacy concerns over under-16s social media age ban bill Also on the program, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie weighed in on the under-16s social media ban and said “we are very concerned about digital ID laws”. [There are] obviously privacy concerns, and given the government’s had to pull their misinformation [and] disinformation – or their censoring the Australian public – bill from the Senate this week, we want to make sure we get strong, robust laws that don’t damage the [right to] privacy and make compulsory Australians having to have digital IDs. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has also spoken out against the bill, citing privacy concerns. But yesterday, Nationals leader David Littleproud said there was “conflation and confusion” about the bill, and that it was “dangerous to conflate” it with digital ID. You can read his full comments in yesterday’s blog. Amanda Rishworth was also asked about Labor’s under-16 social media age ban and whether the government was rushing this. The social services minister denied this and said the government has bipartisan support – or so they thought: Well, I thought there was bipartisan support … I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, Peter Dutton said he would facilitate this important piece of legislation and support the government. And now we see our senators defying him, I guess. So this is a test for Peter Dutton about his leadership. Labor’s social media age ban is likely to pass, following a rapid three-day inquiry with just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first. However, conservative opposition to the bill has been growing in the lead up to the lower house vote: Rishworth defends government economic decisions amid latest outlook The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, just spoke with the Today show where she defended the government’s handling of the economy amid the latest outlook: We inherited a pretty big economic mess from the Liberal and National party when we came to government, we had inflation with a six in front of it. We inherited a policy from the Liberal party that was deliberately keeping wages low. Listing measures the government has taken, Rishworth pointed to lowering inflation, wages growth, cost of living measures and the stage three tax cuts. She went on to say: The alternative would have been if Peter Dutton was in in the prime minister chair. He’s opposed every single one of these measures and we would be in a real recession right now if he had got his way on so many policy issues. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie was also on the program and argued “Australians are feeling poorer because they actually are poorer under Albanese”. She took aim at government spending, and said this was why “in comparable nations, our numbers are in the toilet comparatively”. Queensland premier David Crisafulli begins first sitting week as premier Queensland’s new premier, David Crisafulli, will be only the second member of the modern Menzies Liberal party to sit in the top chair when he begins his first sitting week today. The “conservative, uniquely agrarian state” has been governed by Labor or Country National premiers for all but 1,000 days since 1860 but now it’s Crisafulli’s turn to show he can deliver on his promises to slash crime. Read our analysis of what lies in store: Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. We’re in the home stretch, with just three days left in the final sitting week of the year. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers, capturing all the action. Let’s get into it. More on that Deloitte report from AAP: ‘The time will come for changes to tax’ The economists were hopeful inflation would keep a lid on election spending sprees, as cost-of-living support eases pain but injects money into the economy – adding to the problem it’s trying to solve. The treasurer has already been managing expectations before the midyear budget update next month. In a speech, Jim Chalmers warned windfalls would be nought but a “sliver” of upgrades clocked in the past few years. Higher commodity prices and a higher tax take from migration and bracket creep have helped the federal government deliver the first two back-to-back surpluses in almost two decades. DAE partner and report co-author Cathryn Lee said the government still deserved credit for banking most of the revenue rather than spending it, especially during a cost-of-living crunch when the community has been calling for support. Yet she said both major political parties had broadly failed to embark on the structural budget repair needed over the past two decades. The time will come for changes to tax. It must. Australia is waving goodbye to budget surpluses and returning abruptly to deficit, facing a $49bn deterioration in the bottom line in forecasts from leading economists, AAP reports. The $15.8bn surplus logged in the last financial year to Deloitte Access Economics’ prediction of a $33.5bn deficit in 2024/25 would amount to largest nominal contraction in the underlying cash balance on record, outside the pandemic. The forecast would also represent a $5.2bn mark down from Treasury predictions made in the May budget. DAE partner and report co-author Stephen Smith said: Worryingly, there is little to suggest that the situation will right itself in the years to come. As well as the well-documented pressures on the public purse from an ageing population, Smith warned global developments – including China’s economic slowdown and Donald Trump’s return to the White House – did not bode well for Australia’s budget position. Should substantial tariffs be slapped on imports into the United States, including at rates of up to 60% of goods from China, Australia’s budget will not be immune given its reliance on commodity prices via company tax receipts. Tensions high outside Melbourne synagogue Tensions ran high outside a synagogue in Melbourne last night as pro-Israel supporters gathered to counter a pro-Palestine protest despite the rally being cancelled, AAP reports. A number of pro-Israel demonstrators rallied outside a popular synagogue even after the planned pro-Palestine protest was formally called off at the 11th hour as organisers cited safety concerns. Despite the cancellation, there was a visible police presence near the synagogue in Caulfield North, in Melbourne’s south-east, where a sea of Israeli flags far outnumbered the Palestinian flags. Specialist police encircled a small group of pro-Palestine supporters in an attempt to keep them from the larger pro-Israel group. The planned demonstration was in response to a planned talk organised by the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council that includes former Israeli justice minister Ayelet Shaked, whose visa into Australia was reportedly rejected. It also comes as Australia’s Palestinian community demands answers after a dentistry student was struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Here’s our story: Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be my colleague Emily Wind to take you through the bulk of the day in Canberra and beyond. Our top story this morning surrounds Labor’s resolve to force the big tech companies to enforce its proposed ban on under-16s’ use of social media after the Silicon Valley heavyweights pushed back against the legislation. Meta said the bill is “inconsistent and ineffective” and that it should be delayed until there is more time to develop age verification technology. The big moment yesterday was the Greens’ acquiescence to the government’s housing bill – a harsh lesson in realpolitik handed to Adam Bandt and Max Chandler-Mather by the prime minister. Tensions were running high on the streets of a Melbourne suburb last night as pro-Israel demonstrators rallied after the threat of a pro-Palestine protest outside a synagogue. More on that soon. And more soon on a report from Deloitte that forecasts the government faces a huge budget deficit, running into the tens of billions."

          "headline": "Joe Root: ‘Winning the Ashes in Australia would mean more than anything’",
          "bodyText": "“I know this one,” Joe Root says with a little grin as he confirms the latest milestone he will reach in Test cricket on Wednesday when England play New Zealand in Christchurch. “It will be my 150th Test. We’re fortunate to play so much Test cricket compared to other nations, so you can rattle them up rather quickly. But I’ve had to work hard and overcome different challenges along the way, so I’m very grateful to have had so many chances.” A minute earlier Root had been uncertain when I asked him if he knew what it would mean were he to score another 625 Test runs. A modest and generous man, Root thought hard and then admitted he had no clue. The answer is that, once those runs have been accumulated, he will become the second highest scorer in Test cricket. He will overtake Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis and Ricky Ponting and trail only Sachin Tendulkar. It might seem a small sacrilege to consider the weight of Root’s monumental achievements in purely statistical terms. He bats with such beauty and grace that it is far more pleasurable to watch a sumptuous highlights reel. But as Root racks up yet more records it’s worthwhile to consider the mighty numbers for a while. Last month, while hitting a double century against Pakistan, Root became England’s highest scorer when he sailed past Alastair Cook’s previous record of 12,472 runs. He and Harry Brook plundered 454 runs while setting a record for England’s highest Test partnership. “I’ve tried not to get too obsessed with that stuff,” Root says with a gentle shrug, “because it goes against the way I look at the game. They are all niceties but, ultimately, the real enjoyment is when you’re sat there after winning a Test over five days of hard graft, enjoying it with your mates. I know it’s a cliche but that’s what you want more than anything. The 2019 World Cup final was one of the worst games I’ve had in an England shirt, but it’s one of the best days I’ve had on a cricket field. That’s the beauty of cricket.” Root warms to his selfless theme. “Cricket is a game of failure because the amount of times you walk off disappointed outweighs the times where you’ve had a great day,” he adds. “But there’s always something else, and someone else, you can celebrate. That’s what makes it so fun. It’s not all about you, it’s about collectively dragging each other over the line.” Next month will mark the 12th anniversary of Root’s Test debut. In Nagpur, he came out at No 6 and bumped gloves with Kevin Pietersen. England were creaking at 119 for four but Root beamed. He and Pietersen ended up joint-top scorers in the first innings with 73 each and he was unbeaten on 20 in the second innings. Root had arrived in style. “It doesn’t feel like 12 years ago,” he says. “I’ve got pretty vivid memories of that experience – and all the nerves I’d had waiting to bat just disappeared. I was so excited and couldn’t stop smiling. I remember being thrilled to be out there and having the opportunity to play. I thought of how I would have felt when I was 12. “Throughout my career I’ve tried to carry that 12-year-old version of myself, that kid who dreamed and practised for hours and hours, wanting to play for England. When you’ve done it quite a few times, it would be easy to forget what a great opportunity you have and what it was like being a kid just desperate to play. When I was 12, I would wake up in the morning and open the curtains and pray it wasn’t raining so I could play.” Root concedes that, especially during his difficult years as captain and the grind of enduring a Covid bubble, “you obviously need little reminders here and there … but I can sit here now and say that, thankfully, I enjoy playing cricket as much as I did 12 years ago. It’s important to have that because you need to turn up to training wanting to get better. That enthusiasm, that sheer enjoyment factor, has to be a really big part of who you are.” His pleasure in cricket is obvious as he holds one of the New Balance bats which has allowed him to score so many runs in Test cricket. Root is an ambassador for the company and, even on a day off, he looks serene with a bat in his hands. But what have been the greatest challenges of his career? “The same as any player – dips in form,” he says. “There’s so much information and technology now that the opposition can work you out, pick up trends and modes of dismissals and target certain areas. That’s why it’s so important to constantly evolve. There have probably been times where I’ve overtinkered but it’s all come from trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition. That attitude has brought me a lot of success but sometimes you have to take a few hits before moving another big step forward.” Root’s balanced perspective has been sharpened by the loss he felt when Graham Thorpe, his batting mentor, took his own life in August. He was a pallbearer at Thorpe’s funeral and Root talks quietly about how much he learned from his great friend. They forged a bond on an England Lions tour of Sri Lanka when, Root says: “I’d have been 21. Throughout that whole trip I learned so much from him, how I wanted to create different angles, use my sweeps and manipulate the ball into gaps. There’ve been so many other lessons over a 10‑year period. A lot of my success has been down to Graham and I will be eternally grateful for all that he did for me. “I’ve got so many good memories because he was such a great man with such a great sense of humour and good nature. He taught me so much on and off the field – in that old Guns N’ Roses T-shirt that he wore at some point on every tour throughout that 10-year period.” Thorpe experienced depression most of his cricketing life and Root stresses: “That’s why it’s so important to keep having those conversations, checking in, making sure people are doing OK. You spend so much time together, going through all the highs and lows and being away from your family for so long. Whether they’re in and around the team, or away from you, the hope is that people know they can talk to you about things. You want people to feel like they don’t need to deal with things all on their own.” When Root broke Cook’s record, his captain Ben Stokes highlighted his “selflessness”. Stokes concentrated on the fact that Root is “a great bloke” rather than simply “an incredible player”. It might sound too touchy-feely for the hard-bitten cynic but an hour in Root’s company suggests that Stokes found the right tone when he concluded: “The non‑selfishness that Joe possesses is the one thing that sets him apart.” Root, naturally, deflects the praise. “They’re nice things to hear but ultimately that’s what it should be because no one’s bigger than the team.” He laughs. “I’m full of cliches today but it’s the truth. You’re going to have bad days but you have to try to be consistent and keep driving things in the right direction.” Beyond the personal plaudits, Root is part of a squad entering a defining period. New Zealand are on a high after a 3-0 series win in India this month. They will provide extremely difficult opposition and then, next year, England face five Tests at home against India before travelling to the Ashes in Australia. These next 13 Tests could make or break an often thrilling but still somewhat tenuous era for a team led by Stokes and coached by Brendon McCullum. England won the first Test in Pakistan by an innings. It was a remarkable victory as Root and Brook chased down Pakistan’s first‑innings score of 556. Yet England collapsed in the next two Tests and lost the series against a previously struggling Pakistan. “They outplayed us in key moments,” Root admits, while pointing out that the second Test in Multan was played on the same wicket used for the opening match. The third Test in Rawalpindi featured a pitch that had been blasted with heaters, and raked heavily. “They were fast-forward wickets, a day-six pitch on day one for the second Test and then they’d raked it and used their home advantage for the third Test. “You can understand it as they had not won a Test at home for a long time and they exploited it better than we did. But in those big moments we missed a couple of chances in the field. In those low-scoring games, that can really cost you. But credit to them as their spinners performed exceptionally.” Considering New Zealand’s achievements in India, Root says: “They played some really good cricket against a very experienced and successful team. I think we were the last team to win in India, in 2012, so New Zealand were incredible. It’s going to be a tough tour and then we play India followed by the Ashes. It will give a really good barometer of where we are and so it’s a mouth-watering 12 months ahead. “I’d love us to win the Ashes over there. That would mean more to me than anything. The last time England won in Australia was 2010-11 and I was there at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. During that Test I was net-bowling against the guys that weren’t playing. I then went to Melbourne to watch the Boxing Day Test match. It was great to watch it unfold and to do something similar would be the ultimate.” Root has yet to score a Test hundred in Australia and, in 14 Ashes Tests away from home, he has lost 12 and drawn two. He says: “The last couple of times I’ve been out there, particularly when I was captain, I probably wanted it a bit too much. Ben feels the same. We’ve played a lot out there and not had a lot to show for it. But the prospect of doing so much better this time is exciting.” At 33 he remains fresh-faced but it is striking that Root is now the same age as Cook when the former England record-holder retired. Cook was worn out while Root’s enthusiasm seems undimmed. “We’re very different players,” Root says. “Cookie’s mental fortitude and resilience was his greatest strength but opening the batting takes its toll. Sometimes, you’ve fielded all day and you have to face five overs in rubbish light against fresh bowlers. That can weigh you down more than the role I’ve played.” Root has such talent, the game comes so easily to him, and those gifts help explain his longevity. “Everyone’s different and on a different journey,” he says. “It might still be that my career finishes quite abruptly if I change my mind. But it doesn’t feel that way at the minute and I’m not going to put any timeline on how long I play for. As long as I’m fit, healthy and I’ve still got that drive and enjoyment I’ll continue to keep playing and loving it.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

          "bodyText": "Musicals used to be associated with glee club kids more likely to be wearing jazz shoes than anything cutting edge from the catwalks. But with the film version of Wicked – which was released this weekend and was expected to take more than $100m (£80m) at the US box office alone – promoted by global pop star Ariana Grande and actor Cynthia Erivo wearing Vivienne Westwood, Schiaparelli and Louis Vuitton, musicals are having a pitch-perfect style moment. Even before it opened, there was a glut of Wicked collaborations across skincare, haircare and hoodies – more than 400 in total, including Gap, Kipling, Crocs, H&amp;M, Claire’s Accessories and Marks &amp; Spencer. Fancy London department store Liberty, with its tasteful Tudor-beamed building, has teamed up with Universal Pictures to make over its windows Wicked-style. Ryan McBryde, former artistic director at the Mercury theatre in Colchester, who has worked on many musicals, said: “Oz is depicted in Wicked as a kind of high-fashion, elitist society. They’re all dressing in high couture.” He added: “It makes perfect sense that those companies should buy into that.” That a musical – albeit one in the cinema rather than on stage – is having such a jazz-hands fashion moment arguably reflects a wider trend. On Broadway, a revival of Sunset Boulevard, starring former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, has received attention for what the Washington Post called its “Jil Sander-chic costumes”. The costumes of Cabaret at London’s Kit Kat club – the leather, the lingerie – all could have seamlessly sashayed on to spring/summer 2024 catwalks. Plus, Prada and Chanel are centre stage with the new musical of The Devil Wears Prada that recently opened in London’s West End. Red carpets have for a long time been fashion’s best marketing tool, while costume designers use contemporary fashion as a way to connect to audiences and welcome new ones in. David Benedict, the London theatre critic for Variety, notes that “[costume] designers are looking to place things in a way that people can read”. Soutra Gilmour, who was the costume designer for Scherzinger’s Sunset Boulevard, wants “the people on stage to reflect and speak to the people in the audience, to be of the same world, to connect through the proscenium”. Clothes, she says, “are a great way to support that – it’s a language we all read very quickly”. Enver Chakartash is to thank for the fashion-forward ensembles of Romeo + Juliet, now on Broadway. While it is not strictly speaking a musical, Jack Antonoff, songwriter and producer of Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter, wrote two original songs for the show. “It was important for the costumes to feel of-the-moment in terms of how young people present themselves,” says Chakartash. Hence why those costumes include Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Adidas, as well as Vaquera and Salomon. For the balcony scene, they dressed Juliet in a vintage Vivienne Westwood Care Bear T-shirt. While McBryde points out that musicals “always had a kind of relationship with modern fashion” – he cites Coco Chanel working with Jean Cocteau in the 1920s and Halston working with Martin Scorsese on The Act with Liza Minnelli in the 1970s – he thinks that “the difference between then and now is the proliferation of imagery that you can get on the internet”. Crossover between the two worlds is happening more and more: Es Devlin has designed for musicals as well as for Stormzy, Lorde, Beyoncé, Louis Vuitton and YSL. Tom Scutt, the designer responsible for the Cabaret costumes, has worked with Sam Smith. Of course some of this fashionable moment for musicals might also be down to chance. That the recent West End production of Oklahoma! felt so on trend was in part thanks to the rise of cowboycore. Still, there is a drive for modernity within musicals. “Everybody wants to do a take on the show that hasn’t been done before,” says Chakartash. “A lot of the time that leans into making it feel contemporary and relatable and also aspirational. “When you go to Cabaret, you’re like: ‘Where can I find that seafoam-green coat that looks like [it’s] straight off the Gucci runway?’” When you go to Wicked, you leave wanting to find emerald green, pastel pink and bubble skirts."

          "bodyText": "When Margot Robbie made a surprise cameo in the 2015 film adaptation of Michael Lewis’s book The Big Short, she did more to educate the general population about the risks of securitisation than most financial experts. The Australian actor’s brief monologue, notoriously delivered from a champagne bubble bath, explained how banks were bundling up their growing cache of risky sub-prime mortgages into investable bonds, before slicing them up and selling them off for profit. But the proliferation of these mortgage-backed securities in the early 2000s meant there was a catastrophic ripple effect across the global financial system when borrowers started to default on their home loans. The resulting crisis in 2008 triggered a crackdown by regulators. They introduced new rules that could help ensure that asset-backed securities – once allegedly referred to as “crack cocaine of the financial services industry” by the billionaire Guy Hands – would never again spark such a massive meltdown. But, 16 years later, some experts believe new risks are emerging. And this time, they are linked to highly indebted companies backed by private equity firms, which are part of the growing but opaque portion of the financial system known as the shadow banking sector. Shadow banking refers to financial firms that face little to no regulation compared with traditional lenders, and includes businesses such as hedge funds, private credit and private equity funds. While the use of securitisation dipped in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, as a result of a tarnished reputation and regulatory backlash, its popularity has subsequently risen. Today, the global securitisation market covers about £4.7tn of assets, according to estimates by analysts at RBC Capital. The UK accounts for about £300bn of that total, but more than half – about £180bn – is part of the so-called public securitisation market. In this public market, bundled loans are rated by credit rating agencies and sold on to a broad range of investors, and their terms, structure and sales are openly disclosed. These are the routes typically taken by traditional banks, which face far more stringent regulation. The remaining £120bn is made up of securitised loans bundled up by the shadow banking sector. Private securities are sold directly to a limited pool of sophisticated investors. They are less regulated, need not be reviewed by ratings agencies, and are far more opaque. Some believe that the growth of the private market, and its lack of transparency, could pose a problem. “It probably is an under-appreciated risk, given the lack of regulation in that space and the complexities of the instruments that are being held there,” Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital, said. But even the public securities market warrants close review, according to Natacha Postel-Vinay, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and expert in regulation and financial history. That includes risks related to collateralised loan obligations (CLOs). These are types of securities that are backed by a pool of debt, including loans to companies with low credit ratings, or struggling businesses that have been snapped up by private equity firms with the help of big loans, in what are known as leveraged buyouts. “The private equity firms invest in companies that are almost failing, and in order to make these companies survive, they load them up with debt,” said Postel-Vinay. “These loans end up being repackaged as well, a little bit like the junk mortgages before the 2008 crisis.” And although CLOs are usually made up of different kinds of loans to businesses in a variety of sectors, this does not entirely eradicate risk. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole. You regulate stuff, but then the financial system finds ways around the regulation very quickly,” Postel-Vinay said. The Bank of England is in the midst of compiling the results of its first stress test involving the shadow banking sector, the results of which are expected to be released at the end of next week. Although it will not focus directly on securitisation, the Bank has not been shy in flagging its concerns. It warned last December that, while UK banks were partly shielded from losses on CLOs by generally holding the highest-quality slices of the securities, the UK financial system was indirectly at risk through its connection to foreign banks and insurers that have a high and growing exposure to the loans held by already highly indebted companies. And in June, the financial policy committee highlighted risks related to the private equity industry more broadly: “Vulnerabilities from high leverage, opacity around valuations, variable risk management practices and strong interconnections with riskier credit markets mean the sector has the potential to generate losses for banks and institutional investors.” Postel-Vinay said it was important to determine who should be held responsible before things go wrong. “We want to make sure that we don’t repeat the mistakes [of the 2000s] and that it’s super, super clear who is responsible for the underlying credit risk in these loans. “There are underlying loans that need to be repaid, and they need to be screened, and they need to be monitored … And in these cases, I have to say, there is a lack of transparency. I think a lot of people don’t know exactly what’s going on.”"

          "headline": "The Cincinnati Bengals are squandering the brilliant Joe Burrow’s prime",
          "bodyText": "You could be forgiven for getting a sense of déjà vu watching the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Chargers last Sunday. For the second week in a row, Joe Burrow torched a defense. He hit one eye-popping throw after another. In the final accounting, he threw for 356 yards, three touchdowns and did not turn over the ball. And yet the result was the same: the Bengals lost by one score. What Burrow is doing this season is unprecedented. Never has a quarterback played at such a high level, with such a heavy workload, while being let down by almost everyone around him. Only Tony Romo in 2010 and Aaron Rodgers in 2018 have come close, but even that duo had the benefit of solid protection from their linemen. Burrow does not. Burrow is outpacing every quarterback in the league despite those around him flailing. The defeat to the Chargers marked the third time this season that Cincy have lost in a game in which Burrow has thrown for more than 300 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions. According to NFL research, Burrow is the only quarterback since the league’s merger in 1970 to post those figures in three losses in a single year. With the latest effort, he became the first quarterback in league history to put up that kind of production in back-to-back games. To put that in context, Tom Brady only had two such games in his entire 23-year career, according to CBS Sports. Woof. The Bengals are 1-6 in one-score games this season, a notoriously flaky measure of how good a team actually is, and 4-7 overall. A bounce of the ball, sloppy play call, officiating decision (or non-decision), or defensive stop can tip a one-score game either way. After the fact, we like to ascribe virtues to teams that close out one-score victories. They’re tougher – or smarter. They wanted it more. Their ‘culture’ got them over the line. Sometimes, those things are true – great teams limit penalties and execute the tiny details that can be the difference in a game decided by one or two plays. But sometimes we chase those cliches as comfort food to mask the obvious: it’s luck. One-score games are little more than a toss-up. In the case of the Bengals, both are true. They’ve dealt with bad luck and botched plays at crucial moments, or too often dug themselves into a hole that even Burrow has been unable to drag them out of. There have been missed field goals, decisive holding penalties, mangled coverages, and blows officiating calls on must-have-it downs that, had any of them gone the other way, would have been the difference between winning and losing. They’ve lost one-score games against AFC heavyweights: the Chiefs, Chargers and twice against the Ravens. In all four games, Burrow was close to flawless, throwing for 1,428 yards and 15 touchdowns with one interception. Losing six close games with a quarterback playing this well is almost impressive. Burrow’s numbers this season are bonkers. He has thrown for 3,028 yards, 27 touchdowns and has only four interceptions so far. He’s on pace for the best rushing season of his career, scrambling around to make something happen. He tops the league in QBR and is third in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. In a normal year, Burrow would top ballots for the league’s most prestigious hardware. Instead, he’s left scrapping for the final playoff spot in a lousy AFC wildcard race (NFL.com gives the Bengals a 12% chance of making the postseason). Most likely, the Bengals will be on the outside looking in by the time the postseason rolls around. Asked after the defeat in LA whether it was the most frustrating season of his career, Burrow replied: “Yes.” Why? “It’s pretty self-explanatory,” Burrow said. “Our margin of error is slim … I got to make those plays. We all got to make those plays.” It was only three season ago that Burrow led the Bengals on an improbable Super Bowl run. Back then, everything coalesced around the quarterback. Cincinnati had a solid run game, one of the most dynamic receiving corps in the league, a frisky defense and a clutch kicker. Save for his receivers, everything else has collapsed around the quarterback this season. The team’s defense, once a calling card, has fallen off a cliff, coughing up 26.9 points a game, the fifth-worst total in the league. Only the Panthers – a franchise fielding a CFL roster on defense – have been worse against the run this year. The team’s pass-rush has vanished, too, with only Trey Hendrickson being a reliable threat. They have sunk to 28th in the league in sack rate through 11 weeks. And this is a unit that the Bengals have prioritized, spending more on their defensive line than all but three teams this season and drafting more defensive linemen than any other franchise since 2021. As investments go, there hasn’t been a worse return since the NFT bubble. On offense, they are just as disheveled. Any attempts to diversify the offense have failed. The group still flows as Burrow and his receivers, Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, flow. They have no run game, falling to 30th in the league in rush success rate (and that despite defenses fearing being clipped over the head by Burrow and Chase!). Is now a good time to mention they traded away Joe Mixon, back to his best in Houston, last offseason for a seventh-round pick? To top it off, their kicking game has flat-lined. Evan McPherson, once viewed as the heir apparent to Justin Tucker as the league’s premier kicker, now looks like, well, 2024 Justin Tucker. McPherson has made just 50% of his kicks from 40-plus yards this season and has missed his last four kicks from 50-plus yards, including whiffs against the Ravens and Chargers in one-score defeats. Beyond that, the Bengals continue to have protection woes. Burrow has been hit more than any quarterback since he entered the NFL. Part of that is due to him holding on to the ball and waiting to attempt deep throws. But most of it has been due to a sloppy offensive line. Despite chucking cash and draft picks at the problem, the Bengals still cannot put a functional line together. Since Week 5, the Bengals have conceded pressure on 40% of Burrow’s dropbacks, one of the worst rates in the league. And Burrow continues to get drilled. He has been hit 37 times this year, according to Pro Football Focus. That’s 12 more than the closest quarterback. They have not been soft touch, nice-to-meet-you hits, either; they’ve been bone-crushing shots, including a pair after the whistle. How much longer can he stand up to this physical toll? He’s already missed chunks of two seasons with serious injuries, tearing his ACL in 2020 and rupturing a ligament in his wrist last season. When an offense is focused on a few pieces – in the Bengals’ case Burrow, Higgins and Chase – it becomes plodding and predictable. Yet Burrow, despite being under siege, has stood in and delivered, putting together the finest season of his career. He has not only kept the Bengals’ offense afloat, he has lifted it into the top 10 in all the dorkiest metrics. By points per game, they’re sixth in the NFL. Can you imagine what it would look like with merely a bad offensive line or running game rather than some of the worst in the league? If the MVP award is truly about ‘value’, it’s hard to think of someone who has brought more to their unit than Burrow. Put a league-average quarterback – Russell Wilson or Baker Mayfield – in Burrow’s spot, and Cincinnati’s offense would crumble. Forget a potential late playoff push, without Burrow playing at his current level, the Bengals would not even be competitive. Any hope that the Bengals can squeeze back into the playoff picture relies on the idea that the team’s defense can finally pull its head above water. But it would also require the run game to start chugging along and Burrow’s protection to improve. At this point, they need a minor miracle. But, in some ways, the team has already had that miracle: Burrow playing at an MVP level despite the chaos around him. Asking a quarterback to maintain that standard throughout a full season is fanciful. At some point, surely, the odds will tilt against Burrow. A ball will be tipped. He will misread a defense – as he did late against the Chargers. When the margin of error is so small and the quarterback is under constant duress he will eventually make a mistake. And if the Bengals drop one game because Burrow falls back to Earth or takes one hit too many, then their playoff hopes will be over. Plenty of teams have bungled how the careers of exceptional quarterbacks. But the Bengals are making a case to earn a carving on the Mt Rushmore. From the early career beatings, to failing to ink Burrow’s key weapons to long-term deals, to botching a defensive rebuild, they have hit all the checkmarks. They have so far squandered Burrow’s prime. Now, one of the greatest quarterback seasons on record will probably become an afterthought. As team building goes, it’s unforgivable."

          "bodyText": "In a quiet corner of Stone Island’s flagship London store in Soho, the brand’s Italian chair, Carlo Rivetti, is talking about darts. “You see these big fat guys,” says Rivetti, who is sporting whiskers that make him look more like a trawlerman than a fashion magnate. “Pom … pom … pom,” he adds, imitating the noise a dart makes when it hits the board. Darts is possibly the one British subculture that Rivetti’s brand hasn’t touched: football casuals, rappers, politicians, musicians and athletes have all reached for “Stoney” as it is known in the UK, as a sign of masculine cool. Darts might just be the final frontier. Rivetti, 68, sits down for the interview directly under a massive poster of himself beside Liam Gallagher – one of the models for the latest collection. As we talk, shoppers take shots of Rivetti, who surreptitiously tokes on a vape throughout, with the occasional double take. “The problem is that I enjoy to talk,” says Rivetti. “If I am in a bar and I see someone wearing Stone Island, I start talking.” He’ll ask them where they bought their item and if they’re enjoying it, before buying them a drink. “The garment you put on your skin, the food you put inside yourself, it’s a very close relationship.” Stone Island launched in 1982 as an offshoot of the late Italian garment engineer and fashion designer, Massimo Osti’s, growing menswear empire, which already included CP Company and the Boneville brand. Stoney was different. Osti – a former graphic designer who was into far-left politics and had no fashion training – used military tarpaulin and garment-dyed his jackets, chose outrageously loud colour palettes and created silhouettes no one else would dare try. In the process he won admirers, including the Milanese paninari, the yuppie kids who sported exclusive brands and admired American 80s excess. Its English name is fairly arbitrary – he likes the two words – but was inspired by Osti’s love of Joseph Conrad, who is said to have used the words frequently in his novels. After Osti’s departure in the mid-90s, Rivetti took the brand’s helm – signing off on selling a 30% stake in Stone Island’s parent company to Temasek, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, in 2017, while Stone Island’s sales grew an average of 18% annually from 2011 to 2020 after collaborations with streetwear brands, including Supreme, and high-end labels such as Dior. In 2020, Rivetti sold his 70% of Stone Island’s parent company to Moncler, which also bought the 30% owned by Temasek, creating “a new luxury conglomerate”. Stone Island was valued at £1.1bn at the time of the deal. Rivetti is in town for a couple of things: a signing for the re-released Rizzoli coffee-table book that details the brand’s history, and a screening of a new film about the brand’s factory in Ravarino, near Bologna. At the book signing, fans – who are among menswear’s most loyal – turned up in rare pieces Rivetti hadn’t seen in years. “It was really emotional, because I saw all my life in some way with these unbelievable pieces,” says Rivetti. “When I am a little depressed I come to London.” Precisely why Stone Island took off in the UK is still hotly debated. Most histories pinpoint the European Championships of 1992 when England fans came back after a dismal group-stage exit with bags full of the latest Stone Island, bought (mostly) from the celebrated Genius store in Copenhagen, as the moment the brand properly arrived in the UK before filtering out through football culture into acid house and seemingly anywhere groups of men gathered. “The football casuals of the 1980s were, in many ways, the modern-day equivalents of the young men embarking on the Grand Tour in the 18th century,” says Andrew Groves, professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster. “Rather than bringing back art and antiquities, they brought back Italian menswear.” For Rivetti, a key moment was when a certain footballer called Eric Cantona bought several pieces from Flannels in Manchester, which was a tastemaking hotspot during the Madchester era. “He paid for them with his own money!” adds Rivetti Whatever route it took, the brand has changed British menswear and pop culture. The newly reissued Rizzoli book shows Duran Duran, So Solid Crew, Oasis and the Happy Mondays all “getting the badge in” – the expression for when someone purposefully ensures the brand’s signature nautical badge is in shot. Its newest face is, of course, Liam Gallagher. But it is worth remembering – as pointed out in Magnetic, Tony Rivers and James Burnett’s exhaustive history of the brand’s early years – that by the late 90s, Stoney was so ubiquitous that Dale Winton, Philip Schofield and Ronan Keating also sported it on children’s TV, leading some fans to desert it. These days, the badge still appears in interesting places way beyond the terraces. The character of Rob in Industry, the BBC’s compulsive show about trainee bankers, cloaks himself in Stoney as if it is chain mail; a working-class financier, he has status anxiety. Stoney made appearances on Top Boy – and then one of the series’ main backers, Drake, began wearing it. Keir Starmer has also sported it. “Like anything cool it inevitably gets co-opted by the uncool and that’s kind of how I feel about Stone Island now,” says Sam Diss, host of The English Disease podcast, which investigates the legacy of football hooliganism. “If I see someone ‘getting the badge in’ [now], then they’re either doing it ironically or they’re someone on Sky Sports, like Gary Neville.” The brand’s relationship with football is a tricky one. Stone Island’s chief executive Robert Treifus refers euphemistically to the brand’s connections to the “football community”, but for many the badge is synonymous with a certain type of loutish fan behaviour. That image was cemented after the brand appeared in hooligan flicks Green Street and Football Factory, while it’s also not unusual to see the odd Stone Island piece on far-right marches. According to Diss, for many, Stone Island’s football connections are its strongest of any subculture. “I didn’t know anyone who wore it growing up in the East End … it wasn’t until you went to football and you would see them occasionally pop out of the crowd with these unusual colours, or you’d see some CP Company goggles or a badge poking out of a pub,” he says. “You could see that the people wearing them thought they were the daddy.” Is Rivetti, a lifelong Inter Milan fan until he bought Modena FC in 2021, proud of the brand’s football connection? “Not about the hooligans,” he says, before referencing the Heysel disaster, which he witnessed first hand. “I was in a stadium in Brussels when 39 people were killed, so violence is something that I really hate.” “I’m proud if sports people recognise Stone Island now. Thank God hooliganism has disappeared,” he says, somewhat forgivingly, of the hooliganism that does still bubble to the surface, even if it is minimal compared with what it was in the 90s. “I think that in England, you do an unbelievably good job on this. In Italy, we still have problems, but I hope that we will be able to solve this.” Rivetti doesn’t shy away from the fact that the brand is unashamedly masculine: the DJ Peggy Gou became the first woman to feature in a Stone Island advert this year. “I see people coming into the shop and trying on the clothes,” he says, before standing up and puffing out his chest. “They stand there like this … they get a bit taller. They feel ‘figgy’, you say cool, we say this.” These days, look in most stadium away ends and you’ll see the badge, but equally, rappers such as Kano and Dave have embraced it, while Liam Gallagher ensures its Madchester roots are still strong. When the Moncler sale went through, Rivetti was quoted as saying: “Stone Island is more than a clothing brand. Stone Island is a religion.” So does that make him the pope? “No,” he says, laughing. But when I ask him why he has become one of the faces of the brands, he shifts focus. “I have six grandchildren, and I want them to remember what Carlo has done in these last 40 years. In my opinion, it is important to show that behind the brand there is also the pope.”"

          "bodyText": "We now face, on all fronts, a war not just against the living planet and the common good, but against material reality. Power in the United States will soon be shared between people who believe they will ascend to sit at the right hand of God, perhaps after a cleansing apocalypse; and people who believe their consciousness will be uploaded on to machines in a great Singularity. The Christian rapture and the tech rapture are essentially the same belief. Both are examples of “substance dualism”: the idea that the mind or soul can exist in a realm separate from the body. This idea often drives a desire to escape from the grubby immanence of life on Earth. Once the rapture is achieved, there will be no need for a living planet. But while it is easy to point to the counter-qualified, science-denying fanatics Donald Trump is appointing to high office, the war against reality is everywhere. You can see it in the British government’s carbon capture and storage scheme, a new fossil fuel project that will greatly raise emissions but is dressed up as a climate solution. And it informs every aspect of this week’s Cop29 climate talks in Azerbaijan. Here, as everywhere, the living planet is forgotten while capital extends its frontiers. The one thing Cop29 has achieved so far – and it may well be the only thing – is an attempt to rush through new rules for carbon markets, enabling countries and businesses to trade carbon credits – which amount, in effect, to permission to carry on polluting. In theory, you could justify a role for such markets, if they were used only to counteract emissions that are otherwise impossible to reduce (each credit purchased is meant to represent a tonne of carbon dioxide that has been reduced or removed from the atmosphere). But they’re routinely used as a first resort: a substitute for decarbonisation at home. The living world has become a dump for policy failure. Essential as ecological carbon stores are, trading them against fossil fuel emissions, which is how these markets operate, cannot possibly work. The carbon that current ecosystems can absorb in one year is pitched against the burning of fossil carbon accumulated by ancient ecosystems over many years. Nowhere is this magical thinking more apparent than in soil carbon markets, a great new adventure for commodity traders selling both kinds of carbon market products: official “credits” and voluntary carbon offsets. Every form of wishful thinking, over-claiming and outright fraud that has blighted the carbon market so far is magnified when it comes to soil. We should do all we can to protect and restore soil carbon. About 80% of the organic carbon on the land surface of the planet is held in soil. It’s essential for soil health. There should be strong rules and incentives for good soil management. But there is no realistic way in which carbon trading can help. Here are the reasons why. First, tradable increments of soil carbon are impossible to measure. Because soil depths can vary greatly even within one field, there is currently no accurate, affordable means of estimating soil volume. Nor do we have a good-enough test, across a field or a farm, for bulk density – the amount of soil packed into a given volume. So, even if you could produce a reliable measure of carbon per cubic metre of soil, if you don’t know how much soil you have, you can’t calculate the impact of any changes you make. A reliable measure of soil carbon per cubic metre is also elusive, as carbon levels can fluctuate massively from one spot to the next. Repeated measurements from thousands of sites across a farm, necessary to show how carbon levels are changing, would be prohibitively expensive. Nor are simulation models, on which the whole market relies, an effective substitute for measurement. So much for the “verification” supposed to underpin this trade. Second, soil is a complex, biological system that seeks equilibrium. With the exception of peat, it reaches equilibrium at a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of roughly 12:1. This means that if you want to raise soil carbon, in most cases you will also need to raise soil nitrogen. But whether nitrogen is applied in synthetic fertilisers or in animal manure, it’s a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could counteract any gains in soil carbon. It is also one of the most potent causes of water pollution. Third, carbon levels in agricultural soils soon saturate. Some promoters of soil carbon credits create the impression that accumulation can continue indefinitely. It can’t. There’s a limit to how much a given soil can absorb. Fourth, any accumulation is reversible. Soil is a highly dynamic system: you cannot permanently lock carbon into it. Microbes constantly process carbon, sometimes stitching it into the soil, sometimes releasing it: this is an essential property of soil health. With rises in temperature, the carbon sequestration you’ve paid for can simply evaporate: there’s likely to be a massive outgassing of carbon from soils as a direct result of continued heating. Droughts can also hammer soil carbon. Even under current market standards, in which science takes second place to money, you need to show that carbon storage will last for a minimum of 40 years. There is no way of guaranteeing that carbon accumulation in soil will last that long. But as a new paper in Nature argues: “A CO2 storage period of less than 1,000 years is insufficient for neutralising remaining fossil CO2 emissions.” The only form of organic carbon that might last this long – though only under certain conditions – is added biochar (fine-grained charcoal). But biochar is phenomenally expensive: the cheapest source I was able to find costs roughly 26 times as much as agricultural lime, which itself costs too much for many farmers. There’s a limited amount of material that can be turned into biochar. While making it, if you get the burn just slightly wrong, the methane, nitrous oxide and black carbon you produce will cancel any carbon savings. There is a kind of substance dualism at work here, too: a concept of soil and soil carbon entirely detached from their earthly realities. This bubble of delusion will burst. If I were a devious financier, I would short the stocks of companies selling these credits. All such approaches are substitutes for action, whose primary purpose is to enable governments to avoid conflict with powerful interests, especially the fossil fuel industry. At a moment of existential crisis, governments everywhere are retreating into a dreamworld, in which impossible contradictions are reconciled. You can send your legions to war with reality, but eventually we all lose. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Parsnip tarte tatin, roast turkey, zabaglione – Angela Hartnett’s fuss-free Christmas recipes",
          "bodyText": "One of Angela Hartnett’s mantras for successful Christmas entertaining is “less is more”. Don’t serve a dozen different vegetables that nobody wants, or attempt some wildly ambitious culinary experiment on the most pressured cooking day of the year. She doesn’t apply the same restraint to her own guest list. “Generally, I’m of the philosophy that if you’re cooking for five, you can cook for 15,” she says, though she and her partner Neil Borthwick, also a chef, often end up inviting even greater numbers to Christmas lunch. Sometimes, when there are 20-plus guests, they decamp to one of Hartnett’s London restaurants – Murano in Mayfair or Café Murano in Bermondsey – and take over the whole establishment. During Covid, however, they stayed at home with immediate family. “It felt really nice,” Hartnett admits. “We thought, maybe we should do it like this every year.” Both chefs declare themselves fans of the season. “It’s always enjoyable, the restaurants are closed, you have all the family around you,” says Borthwick, who runs the French House restaurant in Soho. But with so many mouths to feed and not quite enough space at home – their East End townhouse has a smallish basement kitchen and a modest-sized oven – how do they keep everything under control? It’s all down to preparation, says Hartnett. The night before, she preps the turkey, blanches the sprouts, peels the potatoes and makes the red cabbage side. “On Christmas morning, it’ll be me and Neil doing the prep. I tend to organise it all and then nag Neil to do certain things. He makes really good sauces, and I’m rubbish at butchery so he does the carving. I know it feels a bit sexist if the man is passed the turkey,” she adds, “but he is very good at it.” Borthwick also reminds her to slow down. “I can sometimes be, ‘Rush, rush, let’s get it out, feed them,’” says Hartnett. “And he’s like, ‘Let’s take our time,’ and he get the plates hot and serves it all really beautifully.” “We do work pretty well together,” nods Borthwick. Hartnett defers to Delia Smith when it comes to roast potatoes. “I take a good roasting potato, peel and dice them into similar sizes and par-cook them. Drain them well, shake them in the pan so they fluff up, then put them into hot duck fat. Towards the end, I’ll add in some rosemary and garlic, and finish them with salt.” Hard to argue with that. Lunch is served early, around one, but they linger at the table till five or six, breaking off to open presents after the main course before returning for pudding. “We’re quite self-disciplined with presents,” says Hartnett. “We don’t have lots of young kids in the family and, to be honest, food is the bigger deal for us.” Back at the table, she lays out desserts and cheese so guests can help themselves. “My aunt Viviana makes really great zabaglione,” says Hartnett, “so if we’re lucky, we have that at the end.” Often there are several Christmas puddings to choose from. “I’ve got a friend, Nicola, who makes them,” says Hartnett, “and then we’ve had the St John Christmas pudding, and the Rick Stein one. When there’s a few, we get my mum to judge. We do a blind tasting where Mum will go, ‘That’s the best.’” Hartnett chuckles. “I’m not going to dish on who won last year.” Of her Christmas dinner menu for OFM, Hartnett says: “There are all the ingredients here for a wonderful holiday meal, but you don’t need to go nuts because it’s fairly fuss free. You’ve got wonderful turkey, great accompaniments, nice gravy – and a dessert that doesn’t need to be made weeks in advance. There’s plenty for vegetarians too, and enough leftovers for the days after. This is a delicious, satisfying Christmas meal, but with just a little bit of preparation you won’t feel overstretched on the day.” Starter Parsnip tarte tatin I did a similar recipe on the Dish podcast a few months back, with carrots; this is another version. It’s a great vegetarian option and it looks really impressive when you turn it out with the parsnips beautifully caramelised and lovely spices on top. You could put carrots in there instead, or you could do it with onions and fennel – just make sure you’re roasting off the vegetable to get the colour, then pack it in really tightly. Serves 6 ready-made puff pastry 1 x 500g block parsnips 700g, peeled olive oil 1 tbsp cumin seeds ½ tsp ginger 1 thumb, grated maple syrup 2 tbsp unsalted butter 40g chicory to serve For the salad dressing olive oil 100ml red wine vinegar 20ml Dijon mustard ½ tsp hazelnuts 1 tbsp, toasted and crushed Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to the thickness of a £1 coin and trim to a 28cm circle. Place on to a floured board and leave to chill until needed. Cut the parsnips in half lengthways (or quarter them if thick). Put in a large roasting tin, season and add the olive oil, cumin seeds and grated ginger and toss to combine. Arrange in a single layer, cover with foil and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the parsnips are cooked. Put a 25cm heavy-based ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add the maple syrup and butter. Heat until the maple syrup and butter have combined, then add the parsnips and toss together. Arrange the parsnips so they sit nice and tight in the pan, then allow to cool down. Take the puff pastry sheet and crimp it by gently twisting the edge so it folds over slightly to form a ridge. Turn the pastry over and place on to the cooled parsnips, then tuck the crimped edge around the parsnips so they fit tightly. With a sharp knife, make a couple of slashes into the pastry – this allows the steam to escape and ensures the pastry is cooked properly. Place in the oven and cook for 25-30 minutes until golden and crisp. To serve, allow it to rest for a few minutes, then turn out on to a serving dish. Make the dressing by combining all the ingredients. Serve with the chicory leaves. Main Roast turkey with rosemary, thyme and lemon butter There are so many ways of doing a roast turkey – brining it in this, covering it in that – but there’s nothing wrong the classic approach: rubbing it with loads of butter mixed with hard herbs and lemon. I like to put bacon on top to keep it moist. I think those flavours really work well. Afterwards I like squeezing the roasted lemon over it. The pocket of air in the tin-foil case steams the turkey, which helps keep it moist. Serves 8, with leftovers unwaxed lemons 2 salted butter 200g, softened thyme a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved rosemary a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved whole free-range bronze turkey 4-6kg onions 2, peeled and cut into quarters thick streaky unsmoked bacon 10 rashers carrots 2, peeled and cut into 5cm chunks celery 2 sticks, cut into 5cm chunks garlic 1 bulb, halved Zest the lemons, then cut them into quarters. In a bowl, mix together the butter, herbs and lemon zest; set aside while you prepare the turkey. Cut off the turkey wings, parson’s nose and drumstick tips and set aside for the gravy. Stuff the turkey cavity with the quartered lemons, herb stalks and 1 of the onions. Truss the turkey legs together, if you like, with string. Pat the turkey skin dry with kitchen paper, then spread the herb butter evenly over the skin. Season the turkey. Arrange the bacon over the breasts and legs. Preheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Cut out two large pieces of tin foil, large enough to encompass the turkey with a bit extra, and place in a large roasting tin in a cross shape with the excess foil overhanging. Tip the carrots, celery and garlic into the foil-lined tray and rest the turkey on top, then wrap the foil around to encase the turkey, leaving a large air gap. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 140C fan/gas mark 3. Continue to roast for 2½ hours, unwrapping the foil and basting with the juices from time to time, then increase the oven temperature to 200C fan/gas mark 7 again. Take the turkey out of the oven, remove the foil and carefully drain off any surplus juices, keeping them for the gravy (see below for recipe). Baste the bird, then remove the bacon and return the turkey to the hot oven for about 30 minutes for the skin to brown and become crisp. To check it is cooked, put a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh – it should be 70C. If not using a thermometer, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a small sharp knife. If the juices run clear and there’s no pink meat remaining, then the turkey is cooked; if not, then roast for a little longer, covering with foil if the turkey is already brown enough. Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover the turkey and leave to stand for at least 60 minutes before carving. Angela’s turkey gravy Makes enough for 8 servings onions 2, unpeeled and sliced into thin wedges garlic 4 cloves, crushed dried chilli flakes ¼ tsp thyme 2 sprigs rosemary 2 sprigs celery 1 stick, sliced tomato puree 2 tsp white wine 250ml chicken stock 700ml Remove the roasted veg from the tin used to roast the turkey and set aside. Pour the reserved turkey cooking juices into a jug and allow the fat to separate. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the fat and carefully skim the rest of it off into a separate jug (cool, chill, then use for future roasts). Set the turkey roasting tin on the hob and heat the reserved cooking fat, then add the onion wedges, crushed garlic, chilli, herbs and celery; cook for 5 minutes over a medium-high heat. Add the tomato puree and the reserved roasted vegetables and cook for 2 minutes. If using, add the reserved turkey trimmings to the tin and fry for a further 5 minutes until turning deep golden. Add the white wine, then cook, stirring, until reduced by half. Crush the vegetables and turkey trimmings (if using) with a masher or whisk to maximise the flavour. Add the reserved cooking juices and the chicken stock to the tin and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Strain the gravy through a sieve into a saucepan, season and keep warm until ready to use. Vegetarian main Crespelle This is a recipe from my Auntie Maria. It’s like a lasagne or cannelloni, really, but you make it with pancakes. Really thin pancakes, a lovely pumpkin and mushroom filling, fold them over. You can make the crespelle the day before and have them all ready in the tray, make the bechamel sauce separately, and then on Christmas Day reheat the bechamel so it’s nice and loose, pour that over, then bake it in the oven while you’re having your starter. It’s a really lovely alternative for vegetarians. Serves 6 For the pancakes plain flour 40g milk 8 tbsp egg 1 large salt a pinch butter 2 tbsp, for frying, plus a few knobs for the oven dish parmesan a sprinkle, for the oven dish For the filling olive oil for frying shallot 1, finely sliced garlic 1 clove, grated chestnut button mushrooms 100g salt and pepper cooked pumpkin 300g, crushed lightly sage leaves a handful, torn For the bechamel sauce butter 50g milk 470ml plain flour 50g bay leaf 1 salt a pinch To make the pancake batter, sieve the flour into a bowl. With a whisk, beat in the milk, the egg and lastly the pinch of salt. Heat a 20cm crepe or frying pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of the 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan and gently melt, rotating the pan so it is evenly coated. Add 2 tablespoons of the batter. Remove from the heat and rotate the pan back and forth so the batter mix covers the bottom of the pan. Place back on to the heat and cook the crepes on the underside until light brown. Flip over and cook the other side. Remove from the pan and place on parchment paper. Continue to follow the same procedure until all the mixture is used (about 8 pancakes). To make the filling, in a pan, add a glug of olive oil, the shallots and the garlic, and lightly cook until soft. Add the mushrooms and sauté with the shallots, then season to taste. To finish, add the crushed pumpkin and the torn sage leaves. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. To make the bechamel sauce, add the butter to a pan. Allow to melt and bubble without colouring. Add the flour and cook as a roux for 1 minute. Keep on a very low heat and gradually add the milk a couple of spoonfuls at a time, whisking quickly to avoid any lumps. When all the milk has been incorporated, add the bay leaf and salt, increase the heat and cook until it turns into a nice thick sauce. Remove from the heat, remove the bay leaf, and cover with parchment paper until ready to use – make sure it lies directly on the sauce to avoid lumps. To make the crepes, preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Butter a rectangular ovenproof dish about 23cm wide and 8cm deep. Add a couple of spoonfuls of the bechamel to cover the base of the dish. Take the cooled filling mix and divide between the cooked pancakes. Fill each pancake and lightly roll them up like cigars, then place them carefully next to each other in the dish. Finish with the bechamel on top and a sprinkle of grated parmesan. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until it turns golden brown and starts to bubble. Serve immediately. Sides Fennel and orange salad I know it sounds a bit bizarre having something cold on Christmas Day, but I think it’s lovely. Oranges are in season, so this is a way of getting something fresh and citrussy on the table. It works well with cold meats the next day too. Serves 6 fennel 1 large head, sliced oranges 2, peeled, pith removed and segmented rocket 2 handfuls parsley a handful, roughly chopped olive oil 100ml orange juice 20ml dijon mustard 1 tsp garlic 1 small clove, crushed salted toasted almonds 1 tbsp, loosely chopped Place the prepared fennel, oranges, rocket and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the olive oil, orange juice, dijon mustard and garlic to make a vinaigrette. Just before serving, mix the salad and the dressing. Transfer to a serving platter and finish with the nuts. Serve immediately. Red cabbage This is Neil’s recipe and it’s really delicious. You can make it up to four days before and it will sit happily in the fridge and marinate. Along with roast potatoes (see introduction) and the fennel salad, you don’t really need to do much else on the veg side. Serves 6 red cabbage 500g, cored and shredded juniper berries 20, bruised cardamom pods 2 cloves 10 cinnamon stick 10cm, broken into pieces star anise 3 red wine 300ml red wine vinegar 50ml goose fat 50g, or butter or olive oil if you prefer onion 1, sliced apple 1 redcurrant jelly 2 tbsp Put the cabbage in a bowl. Tie the spices up in muslin, nestle in the cabbage and pour over the wine and vinegar. Cover and marinate overnight in the fridge. The next day, drain the cabbage, reserving the marinade and spice bag. Melt the goose fat in a deep frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring, until soft. Add the cabbage and cook for 5 minutes. Add the reserved spice bag and marinade, then season. Place a circle of baking paper on the cabbage. Reduce the heat and cook gently for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Peel, core and grate the apple. Remove the baking paper from the pan, stir in the apple and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the apple is tender. Stir in the redcurrant jelly, check the seasoning and set aside, covered. Serve warm with the main. Pudding Zabaglione This is my aunt’s recipe. If you’re not into the traditional Christmas pudding or cakes, it’s a really lovely, glamorous alternative. Make it the night before, put it in the fridge and it’s all ready to go. Just take it out and serve it straight to your guests. You’ll need 6 serving glasses, such as wine glasses or small glass bowls, with a couple of amaretti biscuits for each serving. Serves 6 egg yolks 6 caster sugar 150g marsala 120ml brandy 25ml sherry 25ml amaretti biscuits a handful, the crunchy kind, to serve Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, then turn it down to a simmer. Choose a mixing bowl that fits easily on the saucepan without touching the water. Add the egg yolks and sugar to the mixing bowl and whisk well. Whisk in the marsala and the other alcohol. Place the mixing bowl over the simmering water. Whisk in a figure of eight continuously until the mixture starts to foam and swell into a light soft mass; it should be very thick and hold any trails from the whisk. Remove from the heat and pour into the serving dishes. Place in the fridge to set and serve well chilled, or serve immediately to eat while still warm. Either way, just before serving, crumble over some amaretti biscuits. Angela Hartnett is chef-patron of Murano, in Mayfair, and Café Murano, in Bermondsey, Covent Garden and St James’s, London"

          "headline": "Why does Dutton say Labor’s international student cap is ‘a dog’s breakfast’ – and what do universities think?",
          "bodyText": "Labor has accused the Coalition of “getting into bed” with the Greens on immigration after the opposition withdrew its support for proposed international student caps. Peter Dutton hit back, calling the plan a “dog’s breakfast” and accusing Labor of creating an even “bigger mess”. The two major parties both claim they want to crack down on increasing post-pandemic lockdown immigration – particularly by international students. So why are they so far apart on this bill? What is the legislation? The federal government’s bill would provide unprecedented ministerial powers for the commonwealth to manage international student applications across the tertiary sector, including setting a cap on universities and suspending and cancelling courses. The aim is to facilitate a 30% reduction in international students from 2025, by reducing new enrolments to 270,000. While some universities would be able to increase their international student numbers, particularly in regional areas, others would have to cut back. Why is the Coalition against it? The Coalition announced on Tuesday it would oppose the government’s plans, claiming it was a “piecemeal approach” and would do “nothing to address the structural issues it has created”. But by Tuesday, Peter Dutton said the opposition still supported placing a cap on international student places and reducing the numbers overall. So why not support Labor’s bill to do just that? Dutton said it was a “thought bubble” and could not see how the Coalition could make a “bad bill” better. The opposition leader indicated he would take a promise of “deeper cuts” to international student intake to the federal election to alleviate the housing crisis. “We’re happy for there to be a cap and to be a reduction, because I want Australian kids to get into housing. I don’t want to see people 40 and 50 deep for rental accommodation,” Dutton told reporters on Thursday. “There will be deeper cuts [than Labor’s proposal], because I want housing for Australians.” Those plans to further slash student spots have not yet been announced. The education minister, Jason Clare, said the Coalition’s decision was “just bizarre” when Dutton had indicated in his budget reply speech – and since – that his party would impose a student cap if elected. “I think Australians who are waking up this morning are thinking what the hell is going on in the Liberal party? What’s going on in Peter Dutton’s brain?” he told reporters on Tuesday. Asked if the Coalition had approached him with alternatives to the cap, Clare replied: “Zero.” In a budget reply speech delivered in May, Dutton promised to slash permanent migration levels by 25%, if elected, in “recognition of the urgency” of the housing crisis. On Thursday, Dutton said “there is accommodation being taken up at the moment by international students, who, I believe very strongly, are taking up accommodation that should be occupied by Australian citizens”. “If the prime minister is too weak and too insipid to deal with it, if the prime minister can’t make decisions that are in our country’s best interests, I will.” What is the alternative? International student numbers are still likely to come down if the cap fails due to existing policies to crack down on migration. They include increased English-language requirements, higher visa application fees, restrictions on onshore applications and Ministerial Direction 107 – introduced in December last year as a de facto cap to reduce visa approvals among “high-risk” universities. In the six months to June about 60,000 fewer visas were granted as a result of Ministerial Direction 107, representing a 32% year-on-year drop, or $4bn in financial losses. It has been widely criticised as a blunt instrument by the university sector, and was due to be scrapped when the international student cap passed parliament. But Clare confirmed on Monday it would remain in place to reduce migration, despite previously acknowledging it was “undermining diversity” and “hurting smaller universities in the bush”. What does the university sector think? The chief executive of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, said damage had “already been done” due to Ministerial Direction 107. “The continuation of this visa processing, which will now keep going because the government hasn’t got their caps bill, is costing the Australian economy $19m a day,” Sheehy told ABC Melbourne on Tuesday. “We are going to go into a continued war on this sector between both sides of politics and in an election year, and frankly, that’s not what we want. I want them to build this sector, not wreck it.” Institutions that would be hard hit by the proposed cap, including the Australian National University, also expressed their concern, citing a “changing policy landscape” that was already leading to job cuts. “This latest development adds further uncertainty for ANU, and the wider university sector – particularly around the exact number of international students we will be able to accommodate in 2025 and beyond,” a spokesperson said. The Group of Eight (Go8) welcomed the Coalition’s position, despite claims from Dutton on Tuesday that a cap would “bake in” benefits to its member universities, with specific reference to profits at the University of Sydney. Department of Education figures, released in September, showed four Go8 universities, including the University of Melbourne, ANU, the University of Sydney and University of NSW, would have their numbers slashed by as much as 14% compared with 2023 under the proposed caps, while the University of Queensland would retain its intake and three would have theirs increased. “International students were blamed for everything from the housing crisis to rising cost of living, yet responsible for neither,” the Go8 chief executive, Vicki Thomson, said. “International students became the scapegoat in a politically motivated migration debate.”"

          "bodyText": "I don’t remember when I first heard about Frenchman’s Creek. Not Daphne du Maurier’s pirate romance, but the house of the same name near the Helford River. An old stone cottage, the colour of clotted cream, that hides in the woods by a burbling stream. Perhaps I dreamed it? I stayed once, one winter, but still sometimes wonder if it actually exists. This corner of Cornwall has that place-out-of-time feel. Unlike the brazen drama of the wave-smacked coast, there’s a peace and a secrecy to the Helford River. Once a bustling highway, now this sinuous passage is left largely to the ancient oaks, the prehistoric herons and the ghosts of smugglers’ ships – the kind that inspired du Maurier, who honeymooned there. This feeling is even more palpable in winter, when the grockles have gone and the ferry – there’s been a crossing at Helford for at least 1,000 years – is anchored for the season. Frenchman’s Creek isn’t even on the main river. It sits on a trifling tributary of the same name. By the time this inlet reaches the cottage, it’s a brush-tangled slip of a thing, trickling over cracked slates, beneath fern-frilled trees. The house was built for a labourer or boatman in the early 19th century. In the 1930s, it was rented for “picnics and day pleasures” by a lady called Clara Vyvyan. She wrote about it in her book, The Helford River: “Sometimes Maria and I would meet there in the winter … and we would sit over the fire talking at leisure about this world and many others. Or I would go down there alone, kindle a fire … enjoy complete solitude. Often, instead of reading, I would sit gazing out of the window at that wall of trees rising to the sky and feeling the quiet of that place as if it were soft music.” I have a December birthday and the husband and I like to get away; to find somewhere for such “day pleasures” as the light and weather allow, somewhere to hunker down if they don’t. Frenchman’s Creek – restored and rented by the Landmark Trust – was just that. Cobweb-blasting walks on the doorstep, a wood burner by which to huddle. We arrived there in the gloaming, a hair-raising affair: the track – could this really be it? – plunging steep and slippy from the road. We were relieved to park, walk the rest, the cottage only revealed at the last moment, as if desperate to stay hidden. We pushed the mossy gate, unlocked the deep-red door, felt the magic, stepped inside. There was no TV. We had no signal. The furniture was neat but simple. I didn’t ever want to leave. My husband had booked a meal at a smart restaurant in Falmouth. Very kind, I said, but could we stay in instead? So we fried up a sort of bubble and squeak, fought over the best burnt bits, drank red wine, wondered: if the world ended, would we even realise? We did eventually venture out. We followed the path along the creek – our creek – to the river, to reach Helford village. Though the cottage seems marooned in a faraway land, it’s only a mile walk from this cluster of whitewash and thatch, and the cosy Shipwrights Arms. We ate crab sandwiches in Mousehole, where the harbour was being strung with its annual Christmas lights. We also walked a coast-path loop of the Lizard; Kynance Cove, so packed in summer, was wave-wild and empty, while a mini murmur of starlings bulged and twirled in the gunmetal sky. And when our cheeks were ruddy and our lungs refreshed, we returned to Frenchman’s Creek, its soft music calling us home. Frenchman’s Creek (landmarktrust.org.uk) sleeps four, from £396 for four nights"

Plans to dispose of low-level nuclear waste from Aukus submarines at an Adelaide naval facility have been unanimously opposed by the local council for the area, who say they weren’t consulted. We will see you back here tomorrow. Adelaide council rejects Aukus nuclear waste plan Plans to dispose of low-level nuclear waste from Aukus submarines at an Adelaide naval facility have been unanimously opposed by the local council for the area, which says it was not consulted. The Osborne naval shipyard, 25km north of the Adelaide CBD, and HMAS Stirling at Garden Island, 50km south of Perth in Western Australia, have both been designated as “radioactive waste management facilities” for nuclear waste from Aukus submarines under the Australian naval nuclear power safety bill, which passed parliament in October. Last week, the City of Port Adelaide Enfield – responsible for the area surrounding the Osborne shipyard – voted to unanimously oppose the storage and disposal of radioactive waste at the site.

Chris Wright is the chief executive of Liberty Energy, a company that provides services to the oil and gas industry across North America. US gas company Tamboran Resources announced in 2023 it had struck a partnership with Liberty Energy for the delivery of fracking equipment to drill wells in the Beetaloo basin between Katherine and Tennant Creek.

Victoria police said in a statement that officers were patrolling near Half Moon Bay about 3pm when they saw a jet ski being ridden close to swimmers. Police will allege the rider was speeding in a no boating zone, narrowly missing multiple people in the water. Three men were later arrested at a nearby boat ramp where it’s alleged one of the men assaulted a police officer. Police said it expected to charge three men on summons: a 21-year-old from Craigieburn with conduct endangering life; a 24-year-old from Hadfield with assaulting police; and a 22-year-old from Fawkner with hindering police.

McAllister defends Labor’s electoral reform proposals Jenny McAllister is also asked about the government’s proposed electoral reform, and comments from the independent MP Kate Chaney earlier today, denouncing the policy. Responding to criticism the reform would allow big money to be splashed at the major parties, she says: The core of this legislation is about making sure people get to parliament because they have got support from their communities, not because they are sponsored by one wealthy individual … People will still be able to donate, to be able to support the candidates. But by placing caps, we stop the capacity for a handful of people, that very limited number of Australians who have access to very large amounts of money, to disproportionately influence the outcome of elections. And I think it is a proposition most Australians understand is pretty sensible. Dutton ‘needs to explain’ international student backflip, McAllister says The emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, is also up on Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, where she weighs in on the international student cap – is there a way through this? She says the “last two weeks in every sitting year are always a big couple of weeks for the Senate” and “it’s a time when we see people’s true colours”. It seems that [Peter] Dutton is planning to vote against this very sensible policy reform … Why Mr Dutton will not support this when he has publicly said he will in the past is really something he needs to explain. Asked if there is a plan B, McAllister – like Aly – says this is a matter for the minister, Jason Clare. We think this is good legislation … If the Liberals don’t support this, they really need to explain why that is … It seems like a reckless approach to an important policy question, done without any explanation. Anne Aly, the minister for youth and early childhood education, has been speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about the Coalition’s backflip over plans to cap international student numbers from next year. She describes the move as “pretty extraordinary and baffling” because “Peter Dutton has thus far thrown his support behind” the caps. I think there is still negotiating to do … The minister for education, Jason Clare, will have to talk to the crossbench and the Coalition. But I don’t know what the intent behind this is. I don’t think anyone knows what the intent behind this is because Peter Dutton has always maintained that they would support a cap on international students, now they have done a complete turnaround. Aly says that “if the legislation does not get through, there is still a ministerial order in place”. This is ministerial direction 107, a regulation enacted in December 2023 that gave priority to students applying to low-risk institutions. Coalition makes last-minute backflip on plans to cap international student numbers from next year The Albanese government has been left red-faced after the Coalition made a last-minute backflip over plans to cap international student numbers from next year. The education minister, Jason Clare, has accused Peter Dutton of being a “fraud” on tough immigration policies after the opposition sided with the Greens and independents on changes to limit new enrolments from overseas students to 270,000 in 2025. In a statement, the shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, joined by the Liberals’ home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, and immigration spokesperson, Dan Tehan, said Labor’s proposal was a “piecemeal approach” and did “nothing to address the structural issues it has created”. You can read the full story with all the details below: Malinauskas to jet to Cop29 for Adelaide host city bid South Australia will attempt to bolster its bid to host a future UN climate summit when the premier, Peter Malinauskas, heads to Cop29 to promote Adelaide as a potential site. As AAP reports, Malinauskas will travel to Azerbaijan this week to attend the conference, where he will press SA’s case for Adelaide to be the host city for the 2026 summit if the Albanese government’s bid to host Cop31 is successful. He says: This conference will attract tens of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars into our state. It will provide an incredible opportunity to market our state to investors across the world, enhance global visibility and deliver long-lasting benefits for our tourism and events industry. If Australia is chosen to host Cop31 it would be one of the most significant diplomatic events in the nation’s history, bringing an unprecedented number of leaders from governments, business and the global community to Adelaide. It would also be the largest event ever held in SA, with more than 30,000 people attending the conference, delivering an estimated economic benefit of more than $500m. Work on the bid started in 2022. Blocking Newcastle climate protest is ‘disgraceful overreach’, Bandt says The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, has criticised the NSW government’s decision to block public access to a Newcastle port ahead of a climate protest as a “disgraceful overreach”. The state government has imposed an exclusion zone around Newcastle harbour ahead of a Rising Tide protest to call for an end to new coal and gas approvals and for the introduction of a 78% tax on coal and gas exports. The plan was to paddle out from this Friday to Sunday, staying close to shore and not entering the shipping channel. In a post to X this afternoon, Bandt said he attended last year’s Rising Tide protest and it was “family-friendly, safe, and one of the most inspiring displays of community power I’ve ever been a part of”. The NSW government’s multiple attempts to shut it down this year are a disgraceful overreach. And they will not work. We’ve just had our hottest year in human history. Again. Yet Labor has approved 28 coal [and] gas projects since coming into office. People wouldn’t have to take to the water if the government did their job. Peaceful protest is justified. Fuelling climate collapse is not. And with that, question time has now wrapped up. Chalmers hits back at opposition’s ‘dishonest comparisons’ on inflation The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked the acting PM, Richard Marles, if the “reckless spending of this weak and incompetent Albanese Labor government [is] fuelling homegrown inflation?” He argues that interest rates have fallen in the US, New Zealand, Europe and Canada, but not in Australia. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, responds to the question, and says if Australia measured core inflation the same way the US and the UK do, “ours would be lower”. If he wants to talk about movements and inflation around the world, he should be honest enough to say that inflation just went up in the US and it went up in Europe as well. And if he wants to make international comparisons about inflation, he should fess up and say that our services inflation is lower than the UK and the US as well. Chalmers says the government isn’t under any illusion about the pressures that people are under, but “any objective observer” would see progress “since the hole that they were left in under those opposite when we came to office”. I say to the shadow treasurer … try to ask me a question … because every time he jumps up here and asks these dishonest international comparisons, he leaves out the key facts … Greens leader urges 2035 emissions target ‘that builds on the UK’s ambition’ The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is asking about the government’s 2035 emissions target – amid the UK’s 2035 commitment to cut emissions by 81% on 1990 levels. Bandt asks why won’t Australia’s government announce a new climate target that builds on the UK’s ambition, instead of opening new coal and gas projects? The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responds and says the question “contains a force of inaccuracy right at the centre of it, and that’s the number of coal and gas projects he’s pointed to”. We have approved 10 times more renewable energy projects than coal projects … but on to the specific question about the 2035 target. Can I reassure the member that the Climate Change Act that he voted for included within it a limitation that says that the Climate Change Authority must provide advice … We’re awaiting advice from the Climate Change Authority that’s considering the important issue of setting a 2035 target, which will be both ambitious and achievable. Will Snapchat be included in social media ban for under-16s? The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has asked the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, about whether or not Snapchat will be included in the government’s social media ban for under-16s. Rowland responds that under the legislation, “there will be a broader definition of social media to what is currently in the Online Safety Act”. Defining an age-restricted service is a new legal term, and … we have been clear the definition is likely to capture what is commonly understood to be social media. The framework will be clearly set out for the public in the parliament when it is introduced. Coalition ‘completely stuck in the past’ on renewables, acting PM says The shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, is back up, and asks the acting PM, Richard Marles, about a report which criticises the government’s renewables plan and claims it ignores key costs. The independent MP Zali Steggall attempts to make a point of order on the accuracy of the report, but after a bit of back-and-forth, Marles responds to the question: Short answer is I don’t accept the assertions which have been contained in the question that has been asked by the honourable member … The series of questions, Mr Speaker, that we have had from those opposite, makes it plain for every Australian to see that this is a party that is opposed to renewable energy and what is absolutely clear is that this is a party still wrestling with itself and the Nationals about whether climate change is actually happening at all. This is a party stubbornly and permanently refusing to move with where the planet needs us to go. He takes aim at the opposition’s nuclear policy, and says “those opposite can be completely stuck in the past when it comes to these policies”. If you’re wondering why the independent MP Monique Ryan is answering a question during question time (when, famously, it’s usually a time for government ministers to answer questions), then you clearly aren’t au fait with the standing orders of the parliament. Fellow crossbencher Helen Haines said she was asking a question of Ryan, the member for Kooyong, under standing order 99 of the House of Representatives. That doesn’t happen very often, with questions typically posed to ministers or the prime minister. If you haven’t got your copy of the standing orders sitting handy by your side while reading the live blog and watching parliament (shocking, if you don’t!) then standing order 99 states: During Question Time, a Member may ask a question orally of another Member who is not a Minister (or Parliamentary Secretary). Questions must relate to a bill, motion, or other business of the House or of a committee, for which the Member asked is responsible. Haines asked Ryan about her bill on lobbying, improving government honesty and trust. That allowed the question to stand, and Ryan to get a full few minutes to explain her bill (on national television), including pressuring the government to allow her bill to be brought on for debate and vote. It doesn’t happen often, but with the crossbench increasingly agitated about several government decisions – not the least of which being the electoral reforms – we might see some more of these moves in the last days of this parliamentary term. Plibersek accuses Coalition of ‘delay and disfunction’ on coal-fired power The deputy leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, has asked Richard Marles to confirm if state Labor governments have entered into contracts to extend the lives of coal-fired power stations into the 2040s? Tony Burke, the leader of the house, questions how “any minister here is meant to be responsible for contracts that states undertake that have no connection with the commonwealth?” The speaker asks Ley to reword the question, and she asks Marles: Given the government’s responsibility for the national energy market, which includes coordination with state Labor governments, can the acting prime minister confirm that state Labor governments have entered into contracts to extend the lives of coal-fired power stations into the 2040s? The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responds to the question and says “the biggest reason to keep coal and gas power generation going longer is the expensive 20-year delay proposed by those opposite, which is the fantasy of nuclear energy policy that they have”. The reason that state governments are contemplating having to extend the life of any of these stations is because those opposite were warned that 24 coal-fired power stations were closing, and what did they do in response to those 24 coal-fired power stations that gave their closure dates to those opposite? They did nothing. They did absolutely nothing in response to the delays that were telegraphed while they were in government … We are having to double down to move more quickly because of the delay and dysfunction that we inherited, and that’s the same position the states and territories are in. Independent MP calls for debate on lobbying bill The Indi MP, Helen Haines, has asked the Kooyong MP, Monique Ryan, why debate on her lobbying bill should be resumed urgently. Ryan introduced a private member’s bill last year to “clean up politics” by enforcing stronger rules and more transparency around lobbying, as well as making ministers’ diaries publicly available. Responding to the question, Ryan says the bill was not debated when placed before the house last year: With the help of Senator David Pocock, we secured a Senate inquiry into the bill. That received 346 submissions but received only a single day of hearings. That inquiry concluded that the government should improve its regulation of lobbyist activities in this house. The government has not done so and it has not indicated any plan to do so. In this 47th parliamentary [term], the member for Indi and many of my crossbench colleagues have placed integrity measures before this house. Bills to stop pork barrelling, bills for truth in political advertising, bills for meaningful and equitable reform of electoral donations – we’ve seen what goes on with that – bills that stop jobs for mates, bills that protect whistleblowers. Not one of the bills has been debated by this government. Ryan says she wants the government to “tell my electorate and the electorates of the other members of the crossbench, when and how they’re going to take action to restore Australia’s faith in the integrity, transparency and honesty of its government”. More than 10 independent senators and MPs band together to admonish electoral reforms Breaking out of question time for a moment, and crossbenchers are enraged at proposed electoral reforms that will impose spending and donation caps they say will benefit the major parties. More than 10 independent senators and MPs banded together in parliament before question time to admonish the major parties for teaming up to “rig” the electoral system in their favour. The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, says there is particular concern for the $800,000 spending cap in each electorate if advertising includes the candidate’s name. Chaney says incumbency advantages and the increase in public funding from $3.35 a vote to $5 are also hot issues. The teal MPs have been unsuccessful in deferring the bills to a committee after Labor used their voting numbers against them. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who joined her lower house colleagues, delivered an impassioned speech in her usual colourful way. They have their snouts in the trough so far that they’re blowing that many bubbles I could jump in and have a bubble bath … there is nothing I can think of worse, towards the end of the year, the end of sittings, and all the major parties are worried about is money and trying to maintain their seats. Here’s a good idea, why don’t you go and do what we all have to do go – earn [votes], instead of buying. Renewables v nuclear: Labor and Coalition clash on cost of energy Ted O’Brien, the shadow climate minister, has asked Richard Marles why the government is “hiding the true cost from Australian families who will have to foot the bill for its renewable energies-only plan”. Marles says he does not accept the assertions in the body of the question, and “what is clear in the world today, whether those opposite understand it or not, is that the cheapest form of electricity is renewable electricity”. And that’s why we have got the renewable sector going again. Something which those opposite did their absolute best to crush … but we have got investment in renewables going again, such that there is a 25% increase in the grid. Now, we are doing that in terms of putting downward pressure on energy prices. Marles continues that the government is committed to “having our nation climb the technological ladder and face modernity by having a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 and having more renewables in the grid in a way which is completely firmed”. That’s what we are doing, because that is what every responsible economy on the planet is doing, and the only other option that you hear in the developed world, literally, is from those opposite, which is talking about establishing a nuclear … industry from scratch at an enormous cost to Australian households, and that is a policy that we will not pursue. For more context on this, you can have a read of this analysis by Peter Hannam: Richard Marles has taken a dixer on cost-of-living measures, and the speaker has just sent the Liberal MP for La Trobe, Jason Wood, out under 94a. Milton Dick urged MPs to “show some restraint today and to show each other more respect”. Question time has begun, with Richard Marles standing in as acting prime minister until Wednesday as he attends the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane. Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh asks Marles if the government can guarantee Australians will not face an increase in energy prices as a result of its “secret target”, with the government not releasing its 2025 emissions reduction target until next year. Marles responds: Since coming to government, what this government has understood is that the cheapest form of energy today is renewable energy … He says that through increasing renewables in the grid the government is “putting both downward pressure on energy prices but also meeting our emissions reduction target by 2030.” He argues the Coalition’s plan to introduce nuclear energy into the grid “will absolutely increase energy prices, because … what those opposite are doing is doubling down on the single most expensive form of electricity which exists in the world today.” A reminder that Question Time is due to begin in the House of Representatives in about ten minutes – we’ll bring you all the key moments right here on the blog. Kennedy on Kevin Rudd: ‘incredibly energetic’ and ‘capable of dealing with whatever comes’ Caroline Kennedy was also asked about Kevin Rudd’s role as ambassador to the US, after he deleted his previous tweets about Donald Trump. Asked if he can he remain in that position, if she has any “advice” for how he should conduct himself, she responded: Ambassador Rudd has the full confidence of the prime minister, and whoever is the ambassador is a choice of the government that sends them to Washington DC. I will say that I have seen Ambassador Rudd, he’s incredibly energetic. He’s forged really strong relationships in Congress on both sides of the aisle. So I’m sure he is fully capable – I have seen Australians argue, so I’m sure he’s capable of dealing with whatever comes. Responding to a question from our own Paul Karp, Caroline Kennedy says that “in terms of the tariffs, we just have to wait and see what really happens.” Who knows, but also as the prime minister suggested, you know, Australia can come out ahead either way. So this is all speculation and we’re picking out sort of the most inflammatory and frightening things that were said. Kennedy says ‘Australia has a very privileged position’ Another reporter asked Caroline Kennedy about her use of the work “best friends” to describe the US-Australia relationship, and questioned whether “best friends [should] really have to fight for tariff exemptions and submarine deals made under the office of the president?” She says the FTA is about to be 20 years’ old and “there’s unprecedented two-way investment, record levels of trade happening every single year.” The US invests here, you’re one of the biggest sources of foreign investment. I think that, as I said, Australia qualifies under the Defence Reduction Act and has a status that no other country except for the UK has. I think out of all of those things, they do contribute to us being best friends. I don’t think Australia actually was subject to the tariffs under the previous Trump administration. So there’s a lot of things that get said in the campaign, but I think that if you look at the positive side of it, which may not be the feeling sometimes, you’ll see that I think Australia has a very privileged position and that’s because we work so closely together across the board. Caroline Kennedy says cousin RFK Jr’s views on vaccines ‘dangerous’ Sticking with RFK, Caroline Kennedy was also asked about his views on vaccines and fluoride in water – and if she is concerned about such views being mainstreamed? She jokes that she is “not supposed to comment on politics and now you’re asking me to also comment on family” but says: Yes, I think Kennedy’s views on vaccines is dangerous … but I don’t think that most Americans share them … I would say that our family is united in terms of our support for the public health sector and infrastructure and has the greatest admiration for the medical profession in our country, and Bobby Kennedy has got a different set of views. Kennedy on Tulsi Gabbard nomination: ‘let’s just calm down and see what happens’ Earlier at the NPC, a reporter asked Caroline Kennedy about Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination by Donald Trump for director of national intelligence – with accusations she poses a threat to US national intelligence through vocal support of Russia. Asked why Australia should trust the US with sensitive intelligence going forward, Kennedy responded there are “thousands” of people who work in their intelligence agencies and work closely with Australia. Let’s see what happens with president Trump’s appointments … There’s another one, he’s nominated for health and human services. So let’s just calm down and see what happens. But obviously that would be of great concern and we’ll see who [actually gets the role]. Kennedy’s cousin, Robert F Kennedy, is to be nominated for health secretary by incoming president Trump. Coalition says Labor’s foreign-students bill not good enough The federal Coalition has confirmed it plans to oppose the government’s legislation to cap foreign students at universities, accusing Labor of having opened “the floodgates” on immigration. In a statement, the shadow ministers for education, home affairs and immigration - Sarah Henderson, James Paterson and Dan Tehan – described the legislation as “chaotic and confused”. Labor’s piecemeal approach does nothing to address the structural issues it has created. The proposed cap in the education bill before parliament will not even touch the sides of this problem. They said it would “compound this crisis of the government’s making”. The Greens are also opposing the bill. The education minister Jason Clare has accused the opposition of hypocrisy for campaigning in favour of lower immigration but refusing to support the government’s bill. Just circling back to an earlier moment in Caroline Kennedy’s speech. She spoke to those who “still question whether Aukus is necessary”, and said: To those who still question whether Aukus is necessary, ask the Philippines and Vietnam what it’s like to have your ships rammed and sunk by Chinese ‘coast guard’ vessels, or Japan what happens when missiles land close to shore, or the Pacific nations when your most precious resource is destroyed by an industrial-scale fishing armada. The long delays and higher prices that result from the Middle East conflict are insignificant compared to the global consequences of a conflict in this region. Aukus is an existential investment in Australia’s sovereignty and way of life, and you can’t put a price on that. Kennedy says Trump return doesn’t mean US won’t be present in Asia-Pacific The US ambassador is asked whether the re-election of Trump heralds the return of “America first isolationism”, and whether Australia should prepare for life without the US. I don’t think it shows that America is not going to be present in this region at all. President Biden has made our alliances [US’s with Japan and Australia] his top foreign policy priority. The United States has made commitments over many decades, they are not going to change and our national interests are not going to change. Overall, the United States needs our friends and allies. Caroline Kennedy says US ‘has no more trusted or capable ally’ than Australia Kennedy, at the press club, reckons the thing that surprises her most about Australia is that it doesn’t realise how important it is. She says no country is more important to the US. Australia may be a middle power but to the United States, you are number one. We have no more trusted or capable ally. In every dimension of our relationship, I have seen the United States rely on Australian leadership and experience. Australia is no longer America’s “deputy sheriff” or whatever the critics like to say. Australia is our teacher and our partner as the United States navigates a multipolar world. That is true in our bilateral relationship, it is true in multilateral fora, and it is vital in this region. She says she will most miss the inspiring women she has worked with. Following on from our post earlier, the shadow ministers for education, home affairs and immigration - Sarah Henderson, James Paterson and Dan Tehan - have described the government’s immigration legislation as “chaotic and confused”. “Labor’s piecemeal approach does nothing to address the structural issues it has created. The proposed cap in the education bill before parliament will not even touch the sides of this problem,” the trio said in a statement. They said it would “compound this crisis of the government’s making”. The Greens are also opposing the bill. Independent Kate Chaney pans electoral reform ‘stitch-up’ The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, has expressed her disappointment at the major party “stitch-up” on electoral reform. As mentioned, the long-awaited changes would add donation and spending caps to candidates and parties, lower reporting thresholds for donations and real-time reporting. But independent MPs and senators are concerned the changes will make it harder for political candidates outside the major parties. Chaney, who has advocated for an overhaul of the federal electoral system, said the major parties’ share of the vote had diminished in recent elections and if they wanted to “rebuild trust and regain their vote share, this is not the way to do it”. “If this bill is so complicated that it has taken an entire term of parliament to draft, surely it needs to be considered by a committee and the public [be] given an opportunity to comment.” She added: The transparency reform is too little, too late, and is a huge disappointment and an insult to the electorate who demanded better. The major parties are relying on the increasing disengagement of the public. The complexity of this bill, the crowded media space, and rushing it through to get away with the only path they’ve got left to arrest the trend of declining support for the sclerotic leadership the two parties offer to the public. Chaney wrote this piece on the changes last week: Education minister Jason Clare has accused the opposition of hypocrisy in its campaign to lower immigration, as reports emerge that it plans to vote against the government’s proposed cap on foreign students at Australian universities. Clare said opposition leader Peter Dutton’s credibility would be destroyed if the Coalition votes against the bill, which is before parliament on Monday. He said: You can’t talk tough on immigration and then go soft on this. You can’t talk tough on immigration and then vote against putting a limit on the number of people that come to this country every year. Over the course of the next few months, Peter Dutton is going to wander around the country pretending to be a tough guy on immigration, and every time he says, the word ‘immigration’, remember this week. Clare urged Nationals MPs, who he suggested favoured passing the bill, to put pressure on their Liberal colleagues to support it. Dutton’s office was contacted for comment. Caroline Kennedy is speaking from the National Press Club in Canberra. She is coming to the end of her term, so says she will be speaking about her time in Australia, but says she is also expecting questions about the recent US election. “We can save the best til last,” she quips. Pacific expresses interest in Cook Islands’ super deal Cook Islanders will be able to easily transfer their superannuation funds under an agreement with Australia, AAP reports, as more Pacific island nations express interest in the reform. The change allows people who move to the Cook Islands permanently to transfer their nest egg to the Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund. The agreement between the two nations covers a gap in an Australia-New Zealand scheme that allows people to transfer retirement savings to their home country. Cook Islanders were in a unique situation where they were also New Zealand citizens with the scheme not flowing through to them, financial services minister Stephen Jones told reporters earlier. In effect, what that deal does is equalised the arrangements between New Zealand and Cook Islands. Australia was working through similar requests from other Pacific island leaders, he said. Tens of thousands of Pacific islanders are working in Australia under a labour scheme and receive the same benefits as their Australian counterparts, including superannuation. They can withdraw their superannuation funds when leaving Australia permanently but there are access concerns around navigating paperwork, fees and internet access once back in their home countries with little support. It’s also taxed at 35 or 45%, or 65% for working holiday maker visa holders. Fatima Payman says Lidia Thorpe ‘was refused the right to respond’ to censure motion Australia’s Voice senator Fatima Payman is the latest to weigh in on the censure motion against Lidia Thorpe, writing on X: “So much for democracy”. When Senator Thorpe informed the government that her Qantas flight is running late, they ignored her and proceeded with the censure motion against her. She was refused the right to respond. [Thorpe] has that right as much as any other senator. The federal government has introduced its electoral changes in parliament, promising the changes would ensure federal elections are not “unfairly skewed by big money”. The proposal will add donation and spending caps for candidates and parties and would commence from mid-2026 if it gains the support of parliament. Independent MPs have been critical of the reforms, accusing the major parties of trying to “rig” electoral laws in their favour. In the lower house on Monday, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Pat Gorman, said the bills would “remove the influence of big money in politics, ensuring that our electoral system remains a system we can all trust”. Trust that election results are not unfairly skewed by big money. Trust that elections are a contest of ideas, not bank balances. Trust that we know who is funding election campaigns with more information about campaign financing provided before voting day. The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, has pushed to send the bill to a committee, which would delay its passage until the electoral matters committee delivers its report next year. But without the numbers in the House of Representatives, it’s unlikely the teal MPs will be able to force that. Read more about the changes from my colleague, Paul Karp, below: Save the Children Australia responds to government’s social media ban for under 16s Save the Children Australia has released a statement in response to the government’s social media ban for children under 16, set to be introduced before the federal parliament this fortnight. It said that while the desire to keep young people safe online is welcome, the focus should be on “mechanisms to hold social media corporations to account, and responses that would address root causes of harm.” CEO Mat Tinkler said the government needs to continue “demanding accountability from social media giants to make their platforms safer by design” – including through the recently announced plan to introduce a digital duty of care bill. As a parent, I hold the same concerns that many parents do about the potential harms that our children face online. I welcome the government’s efforts to try and keep our kids safer online and drive accountability home to social media giants. But I also trust the experts and the views of children and young people themselves when they are raising serious concerns about this proposed solution. Kylea Tink accuses Labor of ‘political cowardice’ for not announcing 2035 emissions target until next year Teal MP Kylea Tink has issued a statement on news Labor will detail its 2035 emission reduction targets “sometime next year” – raising the prospect the government might delay committing to a next-phase target until after the federal election. In a statement, Tink accused the government is “creating a climate of secrecy when it comes to Australia’s climate policies”. Love them or hate them, at least Australians know where we stand with the opposition – with Peter Dutton confirming he is committed to taking us backwards if elected. The Coalition have said they will walk back Australia’s 2030 target and have not outlined any policies beyond that which will get us remotely close to achieving net zero by 2050. While the Coalition will delay the rollout of renewables by chasing a nuclear fantasy which will hurt our economy, jack up electricity bills and extend the life of fossil fuels – at least they have been transparent with their climate denial. Tink said it was “political cowardice from Labor” to wait until next year to announce its targets, adding that Labor “cannot hide behind Donald Trump when it comes to climate action”. Australian voters deserve to know if they are voting for a party in 2025 that is condemning future generations to a dangerous and less prosperous future. Watch: Lidia Thorpe censure motion In case you missed it, here’s the moment the Senate passed a censure motion against Lidia Thorpe: Victorian education minister says VCE bungle a ‘publishing error that should never have occurred’ Circling back to Victorian education minister Ben Carroll, who was speaking to reporters about the VCE defacto cheat sheet bungle. He said the publishing error was caused by hidden text included on published cover sheets. In some instances, only one to two multiple choice questions were published. In no cases were the full examinations published once the VCAA became aware of the issues. Carroll said the assurances he was given from the VCAA CEO that the exams had been rewritten following the discovery were “false”: I was given reassurances that the exams hade been re written that has now proven to be inaccurate. While some exams were rewritten to a satisfactory standard, others were not, and this has been a publishing error that should never have occurred in the first place. Woolworths questioned over claims sector is ‘incredibly competitive’ Woolworths executives have been questioned over their description of the supermarket sector as “incredibly competitive” after conceding only Coles offers an equivalent range. In its submission to the competition regulator’s inquiry into the sector, Woolworths nominated 44 outlets, from Spudshed to 7-Eleven and The Cheesecake Shop, in a list it described as a “broad set of competitors”. Woolworths chief executive Amanda Bardwell told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry today she accepted that only Coles offered an equivalent range for consumers doing a “one stop shop”. “If you want to define it that way, then yes, you could say that,” Bardwell said under questioning from ACCC’s counsel, Naomi Sharp SC. Bardwell said many consumers shopped around for individual items that could be purchased from multiple retailers: Sometimes they might be looking for a full weekly shop, but more often than not we’re seeing customers actually shop multiple times a week and so they’re looking for convenience when it comes to that. The government ordered the competition regulator to examine grocery prices and competition in the sector, with a final report due by February. Coles and Woolworths control about two-thirds of the sector, which is far more concentrated than equivalent overseas markets. Thorpe compares censure motion to Māori debate in New Zealand While speaking to reporters, Lidia Thorpe has ripped up a piece of paper – in reference to the protest in New Zealand parliament last week led by Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke. Thorpe told reporters: If we look at what our brothers and sisters did in New Zealand, [the] censure motion is like that to me. I don’t give a damn about [the] censure motion. In fact, I’m going to use it for kindling later on in the week. Lidia Thorpe clarified that it was minister Don Farrell who texted her about the impending Senate motion, not Murray Watt as she earlier said. Two old white blokes in a suit, they all look the same to me after a while here. Thorpe says it was 'good to see Canavan ‘backing me up’ Lidia Thorpe was asked about comments from Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who said she and Ralph Babet should have been in the chamber for the censure motions against them. She said she and Canavan “have a lot in common actually”. It was good to see him backing me up, and on process, because that’s my argument … where’s the due diligence, where’s the process for me to be in that chamber and to be able to respond? So they didn’t afford me that opportunity when my staff worked very, very hard, to have that motion postponed till later in the day until I arrived. So the government didn’t want me in the chamber, they probably held up the plane, who knows! So here I am. I’m here, and I’ll make a noise all day if I have to. Lidia Thorpe said her flight was delayed this morning and she wasn’t able to get to the Senate chamber by 10am for the censure motion. I had minister [Murray] Watt texting me while I’m on the plane. I said ‘I’m on a plane delayed. Can you wait? I want to be there.’ And so I was denied my right to be in that chamber whilst everybody else voted to shut me down. I’m not one to be shut down. As I say, you got three and a half years left of me and I’ll continue to decolonise and in a way that is best for this country, best for everybody in this country. Lidia Thorpe says she will never ‘kneel to the coloniser’ Lidia Thorpe labelled those who supported the censure motion as “hypocrites” and said it is “a diversion away from the real issues in this country”. Everybody who swears allegiance here, every soldier, every Navy person, they’re not swearing allegiance to the people of this country. Wake up, people. They are swearing allegiance to some random colonising king of England. Where are our true allegiances? My allegiances are with the grassroots working class people of this country, and First Peoples. So until we decolonise and understand that colonial rule harms our communities, harms our people, then you’re just kneeling to the coloniser, that’s not what I will do ever. Lidia Thorpe defiant after Senate censure: ‘I’ll do it again’ Independent senator Lidia Thorpe is addressing the media in Canberra, following the successful censure motion against her in the Senate this morning. She labelled it an attempt to shut her down and said she has only been given more media exposure: If the colonising king were to come to my country again, our country, then I’ll do it again. And I will keep doing it. I will resist colonisation in this country. I swear my allegiance to the real sovereigns of these lands, First Peoples are the real sovereigns. You don’t have some random king rock up and say he’s sovereign. Would you like that happening to your home? Would you like someone to knock on your door and say, ‘Time for you to leave, I’m taking over and these are the new rules of your house’? Well, not on my watch. Victorian education minister apologises for ‘inadvertent publication of examination material’ An independent advisory panel will oversee this process, and will be chaired by former chief executive of VCAA, John Firth. Ben Carroll is now speaking and has begun by apologising to students: First and foremost, I apologise to all students impacted by the inadvertent publication of examination material on the exam cover sheets. The VCE exams are stressful enough, the last thing that year 12 students need is additional stress and uncertainty from the administration of examinations. Today we’re taking action and taking the right steps to ensure that no student is disadvantaged in the marking of the 2024 examinations. Whilst I’m extremely disappointed and angry by what has occurred, we are taking the right steps to ensure all students are treated fairly and no student is disadvantaged in the marking of this year’s examinations. Carroll says Kylie White’s resignation was effective immediately. She has been replaced by Marcia Devlin, the chief executive of the Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership, in an acting capacity. Carroll is also explaining the grade-check process: This process will identify any student who has performed significantly above the expected levels. If so, results will be investigated to identify if they had advantage from the early publication of VCE examination questions. Following this process, if questions have been identified that any student has an unfair advantage, adjusting will be made to student marks. Grade-check process to be used to review all VCE exams where defacto cheat sheets uploaded online Circling back to the Victorian education minister, Ben Carroll, who said in a statement an existing anomalous grade-check process will be used to review all the VCE exams where defacto cheat sheets were uploaded online. He said the process will: Review student marks in the affected exams and identify any anomalies in how students have responded to the affected questions. Analyse if any discrepancies are identified and if so, further analysis will be undertaken. This could include comparing how students performed compared to other students, and how students performed on other examinations. Adjust student marks if any questions are identified as providing anyone with an unfair advantage. This could mean invalidating questions and awarding all students who sat this exam a full mark if necessary. Ralph Babet has texted us a statement responding to his censure in the Senate this morning, over a tweet which was strongly condemned by both Labor and the Coalition. The radical authoritarian left has taken offence for a tweet which did not mention, target or reference any individual. Maybe they should have considered censuring my colleagues who regularly and consistently direct abuse and vitriol towards other people and our great nation. The selective outrage and hypocrisy from the far left is far more offensive to the general public than my simple tweet. Babet – who told us he is still at Melbourne airport waiting for a flight to Canberra – also criticised the government’s proposed misinformation bill. If an elected member of the Australian Senate is not free to say what he or she thinks, then none of us are free to say what we think. The truth is, their target isn’t me; it’s you. I’m just in their way. Long live free speech. Head of VCAA resigns over VCE bungle The head of the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) has resigned over the VCE defacto cheat sheet bungle. Victorian education minister, Ben Carroll, is about to hold a press conference announcing the resignation of Kylie White after practice exams uploaded online by VCAA for several exams reportedly contained almost identical questions to those used in their final exams. While they were pulled in late October, they were widely shared by students online. The saga – just a year after several errors were found in the 2022 and 2023 maths exams – led Carroll order to a “root and branch” review into VCAA. Elephant in the Apec room What a time to be talking trade and hobnobbing with world leaders! President-elect Donald Trump will have been the elephant in the room. As far as I can tell prime minister Anthony Albanese has not been asked about that time he said Trump scared the shit out of him. The censure motion against Ralph Babet has also passed in the Senate. It passed “on the voices”, without a formal vote being called for. As mentioned earlier, opposition Senate leader Simon Birmingham called Babet’s tweets “repugnant”, saying it was fine to push back against political correctness but that senators shouldn’t offend or demean their fellow Australians in the process. Nationals senator Matt Canavan called Babet a “mate” but said the words were “reprehensible”; although he repeated his earlier concerns that neither Babet or Lidia Thorpe were in the chamber to address the censure motions against them, to defend themselves. Canavan said he understood both Babet and Thorpe’s travel to Canberra had been affected by flight delays. Canavan said he would vote against both motions due to that issue. Wong said the censure motions were about “protecting the institution” of the Senate. She said the majority of the senators were in the chamber. We have to make a decision about expressing a view about what behaviours are appropriate in the expressions of those views, and in relation to senator Babet, whether in 2024 the sorts of views he’s articulated – which are frankly hateful, about our fellow Australians – are something we should be condoning as a Senate. I for one, do not. The Babet motion passed. The Senate has resumed its regular business. We’re expecting a press conference from Thorpe around 11.30am today for her response. Bandt urges Labor to come to negotiating table on key legislation stalled in Senate Earlier, Greens leader Adam Bandt spoke to reporters about the final sitting fortnight – with a number of bills stalled in the Senate amid negotiations. He argued that Labor needs to “decide whether they want to bulldoze and block or whether they want to negotiate”. The Greens have put on the table some good faith offers to pass legislation this fortnight. We have seen throughout this parliament so far, that when the government decides to be cooperative, then we can pass legislation with good and important amendments … But as we get closer to the election, Labor’s playing politics and refusing to negotiate, and is instead bulldozing bills through the Senate. We hope that good sense prevails, that Labor listens to these good faith offers that the Greens have put forward on a range of legislation, and that we do this year what we’ve done in previous years, and have some good amendments and pass legislation through the Senate. But at the moment, Labor is blocking and bulldozing and they need to stop it, and they need to come to the negotiating table. The Greens are prepared to negotiate in good faith. Matt Canavan says censure process a ‘kangaroo court’ Nationals senator Matt Canavan said he would have supported this morning’s censure motions, however the government “brought them on without the senators here to hear the arguments against them or defend themselves”. He described the process as a “Kangaroo Court” in a post to X, and added: We have unfortunately cheapened what should be one of the more serious actions the Senate can take. The Senate has passed the censure motion against Lidia Thorpe. The motion received 46 yes and 12 no votes, passing easily. The Senate is now moving on to the proposed censure against Ralph Babet, for a tweet he made last week. Opposition Senate leader Simon Birmingham called his words “repugnant, abhorrent, and have no place in proper, orderly, civil conduct and debate in 2024”. Thorpe appears to have entered the chamber shortly after her motion was agreed on, interrupting loudly from the back of the Senate. It’s hard to make her words out from the video stream I’m watching, but we can hear words like “process”. “Why wasn’t I allowed to be here?” Thorpe can be heard calling out. Shame on you all ... I’ll do it again! Senate president Sue Lines is trying to call for order in the Senate. Babet’s flight to Canberra cancelled Speaking of Ralph Babet, the senator posted on X earlier this morning that his Qantas flight to Canberra had been cancelled today. He previously said he would be voting no to the mis- and disinformation bill, and voting no to the banning of social media for under 16s. Babet has not confirmed whether he has secured alternative transport. Senate voting on Thorpe’s censure motion The Senate is dealing with Lidia Thorpe’s censure motion first, then Ralph Babet’s afterward. Coalition Senate leader Simon Birmingham says the opposition will support the censure motion against Thorpe – meaning it’ll almost surely pass. Birmingham called her behaviour “disrespectful” and says politicians should use their platform with “respect and care”, and also notes that bizarre period where Thorpe later appeared to claim she had intentionally misspoken her oath of office - and then recanted that claim. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi calls the Thorpe censure motion a “disgrace”, claiming the former Greens member is being punished “for telling the truth about invasion, dispossession and the genocide of First Nations people in this country”. Next up is Nationals senator Matt Canavan. He has raised issues about Thorpe and Babet both apparently not being in the Senate yet, claiming the censure motions were brought on with little notice. Canavan calls it a “kangaroo court”, critical that neither Babet or Thorpe will likely be able to speak on their own censure motion – Penny Wong responds that the opposition Senate leader, Birmingham, backed the timing already. The Senate is voting on the censure motion now. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie will today introduce a bill that could force gambling companies to return stolen funds used to finance bets. Wilkie, who has moved similar legislation in the past without support from major parties, was developed in consultation with a former financial advisor who stole millions of dollars from his clients to service his gambling addiction. Gavin Fineff has pleaded guilty to multiple fraud-related offences. But the bookmakers who accepted his bets have kept the money. Wilkie said his bill would ensure gambling companies pay closer attention to how bets are financed: My bill puts a positive obligation on gambling companies to report to Austrac if they have reason to suspect a person is paying for a gambling service with money they’ve obtained illegally. It also enables the federal court to order a gambling company to return stolen funds, where it’s found that a bettor has paid for a gambling service using funds they obtained illegally. Details of the censure motions for Thorpe and Babet The censure motions are online. The proposed censure motion for Lidia Thorpe says the Senate “expresses its profound disapproval of Senator Thorpe’s disrespectful and disruptive protest at the Parliamentary Reception for their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on 21 October 2024 given that the senator has many other avenues to express her views” – calling her behaviour “disruptive and disrespectful conduct”. It goes further, to say that – if passed – the Senate “does not regard it as appropriate for Senator Thorpe to represent the Senate as a member of any delegation during the life of this parliament”. The proposed censure motion for Ralph Babet calls on him to be censured “for his inflammatory use of hate speech, designed to drive division for his own political benefit” and that the Senate “assures all Australians that no matter their race, religion, gender, sex, or sexuality that they are valued, welcome members of our society”. The censure motion “calls on all senators to engage in debates and commentary respectfully, and to refrain from inflammatory and divisive comments, both inside and outside the chamber, at all times”. Wong calls for ‘standards of respect’ in parliament Back in the senate, Penny Wong is continuing on the censure motions: These are actions which seek to incite outrage and grievance, actually to boost their own profiles, and this is part of a trend that we do see internationally, but quite frankly we don’t need here in Australia. We should deny them the attention they seek, but in doing so, we should also signal the upholding of standards. Standards of respect, when we have dignitaries visit our parliament; in Senator [Lidia] Thorpe’s case, no less than the head of state. And standards of respect when it comes to talking about our fellow Australians, and in Senator [Ralph] Babet’s case, deliberate abuse of some of our fellow Australians. Thorpe issues statement on censure motion: ‘I will not be silent’ Independent senator Lidia Thorpe issued a statement just prior to the censure motion, stating she “in no way” regrets protesting King Charles and “would do it again”. It is time this country reckons with its history, and puts a stop to the continuing Genocide on First Peoples … Across the world, we see a fierce, united front declaring that the era of silence is over, truth-telling is here and the power of First People’s solidarity will not be denied. Thorpe said she was “silenced and removed” from the king’s parliamentary reception “for pointing out that the Crown stole from First Peoples, and now the major parties want to try again to silence me and shut me down”. I will not be silent. The truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives. The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the First Peoples of this country. These crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and failure to prevent genocide. The Crown must be held accountable for these crimes. And this government must be held accountable for ongoing injustice against First Peoples in this country. Since my protest to the king in parliament, there have been three First Nations people die in custody that we know about. In just the last 11 months there have been 22 black deaths in custody. Happening right now in the Senate, Labor’s Senate leader Penny Wong says the government and opposition are seeking to censure Lidia Thorpe and Ralph Babet with separate censure motions. Thorpe’s censure relates to her interruption of King Charles’ reception at Parliament House on his visit – and Babet’s appears to be related to a controversial tweet he made after Donald Trump’s election win. Wong claims the government “moves these motions reluctantly” and accuses both Thorpe and Babet of seeking to “get attention” with what she called “actions and stunts designed to create storms on social media”. ‘Covid is still with us’: Greens senator to miss parliament due to coronavirus infection Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne says she will not attend parliament today as she has been diagnosed with Covid-19. She wrote in a post to X: Thankfully I’m on the mend but this is a good reminder that Covid is still with us. Please take care. It’s maddening to be stuck in bed but hopefully I’ll be able to join my colleagues later in the week! Hanson-Young on environment, housing legislation before the Senate Let’s just circle back to an interview that Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young gave to ABC TV earlier this morning. As we’ve already mentioned, the Greens have signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone – the second concession on stalled legislation from the party in less than a week. Asked if there was much dissension within the party before coming to this decision, Hanson-Young said “we had a very robust and good conversation about this”. We know that the science is clear. The ice caps are melting and the climate crisis is getting worse, every time a new coal and gas mine is approved by the government, it makes the climate crisis worse, we do have to stop that. But the prime minister won’t budge. And you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. So we will have that fight at the election. Asked if this was a reflection of the Greens being too obstructionist in the Senate, the senator said what the party is trying to do is “make sure we can deliver real positive change for people”. Every negotiation takes movement from both sides, a bit of give and take. We have put on the table a new offer for the government over their housing legislation [and] we don’t think the housing bills before the Senate go anywhere near dealing with the crisis … But we do want to see if we can get some more support for those who are really struggling at the crisis point. Dutton says he’s confident he can ‘work very effectively’ with Trump Peter Dutton was asked about new polling suggesting 47% of voters believe he is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Dutton argued he was “better equipped to lead our country” because “we have a weak prime minister at the moment who doesn’t know the difference between right and wrong when it comes to national security, his instincts are all wrong when it comes to the economy”. I think in terms of our most important ally, the United States, and president Trump, I can work very effectively with him and with other world leaders, and I think I’ve demonstrated that in senior portfolios over a long period of time. ‘We want to see the books before we commit to any tax cuts,’ Dutton says Peter Dutton was asked if the Coalition is walking away from committing to the stage-three tax cuts. He responded that “we want to see the books before we commit to any tax cuts”. The government is spending money again. Back to the Reserve Bank governor’s constant warnings. Interest rates are higher in this country because the Albanese government continues to splash money out, and that fuels inflation, which keeps interest rates higher … So let’s see how much money is in the bank, and let’s see what room we have to move, but we’re going to act responsibly, as we’ve always done. Dutton accuses PM of being ‘obsessed with the Greens’ and forgetting about people ‘in the suburbs’ The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been speaking to Sky News about a range of issues this morning. Asked if there has there been any recalibration in his thinking since Trump’s victory in the US, Dutton argued that prime minister Anthony Albanese has made a “deliberate political decision to go with the elites, and he’s left behind people who are struggling in the suburbs”. Asked who these “elites” are, Dutton replied: If you look at the prime minister’s own lens on the world, he looks at it through the granular lens. He looks at it through, what can he do to stop people leaving the Labor party to vote for the Greens? He’s obsessed with the Greens, and he’s forgotten about people who are working out in the suburbs. The Labor party now has been dragged so far to the left, not just on the woke stuff, but the economy and the national security decisions. He’s made our country less safe because they’ve let criminals out of immigration detention. Has made our country less safe because they bought in 3,000 Gazans without security checks, bringing people from a zone which is controlled by a terrorist organisation. And people are saying, well, hang on, what are you doing for us? New 24-hour crisis response to online extremism The government has established a 24-hour Indo-Pacific crisis response capability to monitor terrorist and violent extremist online content and alert both digital platforms and government agencies in Australia and around the region. Beginning today, the new monitoring function is designed to enhance the existing system for urgently referring extremist content to the eSafety Commissioner. The home affairs minister Tony Burke said the government was partnering with the Online Harms Foundation, which is part of the global Tech Against Terrorism organisation formed to tackle terrorist activity on the internet. This collaboration will help us strengthen our national security measures and protect our digital space from the spread of terrorist content, wherever in the world it originates. Adam Morton is in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku for the Cop29 summit. Australia has been accused of “not acting in good faith” by promoting its climate credentials while still approving coal and gas projects: Farmers will receive around $1bn by the year 2030 for hosting large-scale wind and solar farm on their land, according to a new report from the Clean Energy Council and Farmers for Climate Action. The Billions in the Bush report suggests regional communities will receive another $200m through community benefits funds and local clean-energy schemes. Those payments to landholders are estimated to rise to between $7.7bn and $9.7bn by 2050, and regional community contributions to $2.2bn. The Farmers for Climate Action CEO, Natalie Collard, said renewable energy projects were making farmland more productive. Australia’s clean, green farmers have been hosting clean energy since the windmill was invented. Hosting modern clean energy helps our farmers continue their traditions. Farmers that choose to host renewables are farming sheep and cattle around wind turbines and under solar panels, creating a double income from the land. The two organisations are seeking to improve understanding of the economic opportunities for landholders in the clean energy transition, in the face of pushback in some regional areas against solar and wind projects in particular. Chalmers says Coalition have no ‘costed or credible or coherent policies’ Taking a final question from reporters, Jim Chalmers took aim at the Coalition and accused them of having no “costed or credible or coherent policies” yet: They’ve opposed our cost-of-living help, they won’t tell us what they’ll do with the tax cuts, they won’t tell us what their $315bn in cuts means for Medicare or housing. We know that Peter Dutton went after Medicare last time [the Coalition was in] office, we know that they hate wage increases, so ordinary Australians will go backwards in tangible ways if we hand the keys to Peter Dutton and Angus Taylor, who won’t come clean on their plans, whether it’s on income tax or in other areas as well. Back at Jim Chalmers’ press conference, the treasurer was asked about the Greens’ offer to pass the Nature Positive legislation, plus housing reforms that are held up in the Senate. He told reporters the government “engage[s] respectfully with the Greens” and “we know that we don’t have a majority in the Senate, and so we play the cards we’re dealt”. We try and do the best we can to pass as much of our agenda as we can. I say to the Greens, if you want more investment in housing … stop teaming up with the Liberals and Nationals to prevent more investment in housing, or to prevent more rental properties being built, or prevent it being easier for people to get a job in the housing market. Now, we’ve got a broad, ambitious housing agenda … We want to get cracking on this investment in housing. We engage respectfully, we negotiate where we have to. People should expect to see more of that over the course of the next couple of weeks. The corporate regulator is suing National Australia Bank over allegations it did not respond to hundreds of hardship requests within the required timeframe. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a statement that NAB and one of its subsidiaries “failed 345 of its customers at their most vulnerable” when it didn’t respond to hardship applications within the 21-day legal timeframe. The Asic chair, Joe Longo, said: These customers included people who were domestic violence victims, battling serious medical conditions, dealing with business closures or job loss. NAB’s failures likely compounded the already challenging situation for these people. Lenders are legally obliged to promptly consider all hardship requests, although they are not required to agree to any proposed loan changes. The alleged breaches occurred between 2018 and 2023, and the regulator is asking the federal court to impose various penalties including fines. Longo said there had been an increased number of customers seeking relief from their lenders amid rising cost of living pressures. NAB said in a statement today that it disclosed the issue to Asic in late 2023. NAB group executive, Sharon Cook, said: We’re sorry that this happened when a number of our customers were in difficult situations and needed us to be there for them. We are focused on ensuring these customers receive the support they need. Chalmers responds to PBO analysis about bracket creep A reporter asked about analysis from the parliamentary budget office showing bracket creep is going to cost taxpayers about half a trillion dollars over the next decade, starting from next year. Does that mean the government has to start thinking about another round of tax cuts? Jim Chalmers responded: That PBO analysis does assume, I think bravely, that there’ll be no changes to the income tax system for a decade, and often the floor and that sort of analysis is that assumption. It would be a rare period in Australian taxation for there not to be income tax changes over a full decade, and we should not likely dismiss the ways that we are returning bracket creep with the changes we made and the tax cuts that we are providing. We cut two rates and lifted two thresholds, and that recognises there’s more than one way to return bracket creep in our tax system, and we’re doing it in a way which is best for participation and make sure that every taxpayer gets a tax cut, not just some taxpayers getting a tax cut, and they’re flowing into the economy right now. Chalmers added that “people shouldn’t expect us to take a big new income tax cut policy to the 2025 election”. Jim Chalmers is now taking questions from reporters. Asked if he is concerned about an increase in pricing for businesses with the cash mandate, he said: We’re prepared to be reasonable about it and we don’t anticipate the sorts of pricing behaviour that you’re concerned about. Chalmers outlines agenda for the fortnight ahead Speaking about the parliamentary fortnight ahead, Jim Chalmers outlined his agenda as follows: I’ll be hoping to introduce new legislation, for example, the production tax credits as part of our Future Made in Australia agenda next week. [I will make] a ministerial statement to the parliament on Wednesday about the progress that Australians have made together when it comes to getting inflation down and wages up, and rolling out cost-of-living help at the same time as we reform our economy for the future. We’ll have more to say, Stephen [Jones] and I, later in the week around superannuation and the retirement phase. We’ll be hosting another investor round table on Friday, focused on housing and the energy transformation, and other matters. And next Friday, Friday week, I’ll be hosting the state and territory treasurers here for the Council of Federal Financial Relations as well. Jim Chalmers addressing media from Canberra The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media from Canberra about the government’s announcement that from 2026, businesses selling essential goods and services will be forced to accept cash unless granted a special exemption. As we’ve already flagged in the blog, you can read all the details on this below: Chalmers touted the policy and said: [Cash] can be an important backup. It gives people peace of mind and a sense of security, and that’s why we are making it an ongoing feature of our economy … We’ve seen these sorts of mandates work in other parts of the world, we’ve seen them work in parts of the United States, and we’re confident that we can make it work here as well. The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is also speaking to reporters, and said this would be good “for the 1.5m Australians who use cash for about 80% of their transactions, but it’s good for the rest of us as well”. Jane Hume was also asked to weigh in on news that treasury is looking to impose a levy on banks to ensure they keep regional branches opened. She questioned that if this was such a priority for the government, “why is it they have waited until the last two weeks of sitting for this year, potentially the last two weeks of sitting for this Parliament, to take action?” Asked if she supported the move in principle, Hume said: We want to see that people in regional and rural areas are serviced appropriately and can be banked appropriately. Whether the appropriate way to go about that is by imposing more costs on banks that will be passed on to consumers, that remains to be seen. Jane Hume on government’s proposal regarding cash payments for essentials The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, was on ABC TV earlier, asked about a government mandate from 2026 that businesses selling essential goods and services will be forced to accept cash unless granted a special exemption. She argued that this was the government “thrashing about for an economic narrative after 2.5 years, what they have come up with is a plan for a plan”. It isn’t coming into effect until 2026, not dissimilar to the surcharge announcement of a couple of weeks ago. This does seem to be a consultation about a consultation before we make a decision. Asked if the opposition supported this in principle, she said “all we have seen is a media release, we haven’t seen anything else”. … of course people should be able to use cash, but inflicting more regulation, more red tape, on businesses, large and small, does have implications for the cost of goods and services and Australians are already paying too higher a price for decisions this government is making. We’ll wait and see what it is that they actually want to investigate because at the moment, it’s just a consultation. It’s just another plan for a plan. It’s not action. Hanson-Young says parliament shouldn’t ‘bow down and kiss the feet of Trump’ Turning to the United States, Sarah Hanson-Young said that in the wake of the Trump election Australia has “got to reassess [and] rethink our relationship with the US”. The majority of Australians didn’t want the Trump election result, but we’ve got it, and we have to take this time now to think about what that means. And I’m sorry, but I’m not going to be lectured to – and I don’t think the parliament or the government or Kevin Rudd for that matter, should be lectured to by the rightwing nut jobs who think that we should bow down and kiss the feet of Donald Trump. I mean, they’re selling out Australia if they’re asking us to bow down like that. This is a time for Australia to be clear-eyed, assess our independence, assess our needs and the interests of Australia, and just, you know, bowing down and kissing the feet of somebody who, frankly, is continuing to push more lies and disinformation about healthcare, about women, about climate change – Australians are horrified at what might come next. Hanson-Young said Australia wants a “good relationship” with the US, but “it’s got to be an honest relationship”. Asked what she thinks the chance of the Nature Positive legislation passing is, Sarah Hanson-Young said: The government has continued to say to us that their big problem with negotiating with us and the rest of the crossbench was the concerns around the climate trigger. Well, we’ve heard that. We’ve put that aside. It’s now time to talk turkey. And asked if Greens supporters may have been expecting the party to stand firm on the climate trigger, Hanson-Young said: “I think people can see that the prime minister was unwilling to budge, that he came to the demands of Gina Rinehart of the mining lobby.” Greens hope dropping of climate trigger demand seen as ‘offer of goodwill’ Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking with ABC RN after the party signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone. She said the Greens would put aside its push for a climate trigger until the federal election: We have decided to put aside our demand for the climate trigger. We’ll have that fight at the election, and we’ll push the next government to deliver it, because it has to happen. It’s just bonkers not to have the climate impacts assessed before [getting the] ticket approved by the environment minister. But I’m trying to get something done here, and we know that deforestation and the logging of native forests is at a point in Australia now that it just can’t continue. Hanson-Young said she had a scheduled meeting with the minister today and “I hope that this is seen as an offer of goodwill.” Minns on pay negotiations with NSW nurses: ‘We’ve hit a brick wall’ Chris Minns was also asked about the ongoing midwives and nurses strikes in NSW, who are asked for an immediate 15% wage increase, citing higher rates of pay in other states and the cost-of-living crisis. Nurses and midwives said they were “infuriated” after NSW police won a pay deal that will see wages rise by up to 40%, while they have been negotiating with the state government since April – who are not budging on a blanket 10.5% pay rise offered over three years for all NSW public-sector workers. Speaking this morning, Minns said “of course nurses deserve a pay rise”: We’ve tried to do that in NSW. We’ve got rid of the wages cap that was in place, we’ve put in an independent industrial court. So if we don’t agree with the union, we’ll let the judge make a determination on our behalf and we’ll stick by it. And crucially, we’ve introduced ratios for public hospitals, which the union’s been fighting for 20 years. The premier said he wishes he could “announce a breakthrough this morning”. We’ve genuinely been trying around the negotiating table for six months, but we’ve hit a brick wall. And the reason we’ve hit a brick wall is we can’t afford 16% in one year, which is what the nurses are asking for. We’ve tried to work out a different arrangement with them to get to get more in the pockets of nurses and midwives in the state. We haven’t got there yet, and I’m sorry about that, but we’re at a cul de sac here. NSW premier touts social media ban for under 16s The NSW premier, Chris Minns, was just speaking with the Today Show about the social media ban for children under 16 set to be introduced before the federal parliament this fortnight. Minns said “it’s very difficult for parents to say no to kids” and the government knows some children would breach the proposed ban – “just as we know some kids smoke before they turn 18” – but “the vast majority don’t because the rules are in place”. And what this does by putting in the law, by putting in the regulation, it means that parents can say, at the very least to their kids, ‘I’m not going to breach the protections that are in place to get you on social media because it’s against the law.’ I’m a parent of teenage kids. We’ve had similar conversations with our own children. We need to strengthen parents hands in relation to this. Give them an opportunity to let their children lead a normal life. My strong suspicion is in 20 years’ time, we’ll look back and say, ‘Why did we allow this to happen?’ And the truth is, it crept up on us. This technological change has been so quick, so rapid. It’s been difficult for governments and parents to get in front of it. But we need to start now. Chalmers to the Greens: pass our bills The treasurer Jim Chalmers has upped the pressure on the Greens to pass a raft of stalled government legislation as parliament begins its final sitting fortnight for the year. Speaking to ABC RN, Chalmers called on the Greens “to do the right and responsible thing” and pass the government’s bills, as the party offered a compromise on both the stalled Help to Buy legislation and on its proposed Nature Positive laws. We take nothing for granted. We know there’s a lot of negotiating going on right now. Our interest here and our objective here is to pass as much legislation as we can in the next couple of weeks. We know that we’re running out of parliamentary runway in this year at least and so we want to get as much done as we can. Chalmers confirmed he will address the parliament on Wednesday about the state of the economy and is working towards bringing down a budget in March. Continuing from our last post, the CEO of Homelessness Australia, Kate Colvin, said demand for homelessness services had “erupted” and “the system is so under-resourced that people who are homeless can’t get in front of a worker who can help them”. With more than three million Australians now at risk of homelessness, services are forced to close their doors, leave calls unanswered, and turn away families with children on one in five days. People who could have afforded private rentals just a few years ago are now resorting to couch surfing, sleeping in cars or pitching a tent. Homelessness services simply don’t have the staff to stretch to everyone needing help, and have to go on ‘by-pass’, and triage support to people each day. This means opportunities to help people avoid homelessness are missed; and people go longer without support or miss out entirely, making the path out of homelessness longer, more brutal and less likely to succeed. Three million Australians are at risk of homelessness, a 63% increase since 2016, a new report from Homelessness NSW and Impact Economics has revealed. By looking at household data including income, support and rental stress, the report found in 2022 there were 3.04m Australians now at risk of homelessness, an increase on the 1.87m reported in 2016. A key driver was the 17.9% increase in people experiencing rental stress since the 2021 Census, the report said. In 2022-23 over 250,000 Australians received assistance from a Specialist Homelessness Service, but many more are now being turned away, including families and young people. Surveying 23 frontline services, the report found: 1 in every five days the frontline services could not assist a family with children because they were so stretched. Individuals without children were turned away 1 in every 2 days. Unaccompanied young people and children without accommodation were turned away on 1 in 9 days. Chalmers accuses Dutton of ‘reckless arrogance’ not suited to managing foreign policy The treasurer Jim Chalmers has been making the rounds on breakfast programs this morning, also speaking with the Today Show. He was also asked about polling showing 47% of voters believe Peter Dutton is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Asked how he plans on shifting that opinion, Chalmers said: “I focus on numbers in the economy, not not numbers in the opinion polls.” I think more broadly, the government under Anthony Albanese has got an excellent record of managing relationships around the world, making genuine progress, whether it’s with China, whether it’s with American friends or others. Asked if Trump and Dutton are more aligned, Chalmers said Albanese had “already had a very productive conversation” with Trump: I think when it comes to Peter Dutton, I think he has a kind of a reckless arrogance which doesn’t lend itself to foreign policy and maintaining and managing some of these complex relationships. I think he would be a risk to our economy, and that’s because that reckless arrogance, which has been a defining feature of his time as a politician over a long period of time now … [it] doesn’t lend itself to managing these relationships, which are so important to us. Politicians weigh in on new polling suggesting voters think Dutton better suited to deal with Trump Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Greens senator Nick McKim were up on the Today Show earlier, asked about new polling suggesting 47% of voters believe Peter Dutton is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Lambie said she doesn’t think it matters who deals with Trump, because he is “going to make his own decisions and he’s going to do whatever he wants to do”. It won’t matter who’s dealing with him. He’s unstable. McKim added it was “no surprise” because “Trump and Dutton are cut from the same cloth”. Interestingly, in that poll, 55% of Australians say that Trump’s going to make the world a less safe place, which is quite right. And that’s why we should be re-evaluating our lockstep with the US at the moment. Lambie said the number one thing Australians are worried about is the cost of living, and the major parties should “start zooming in to what they’re going to do to fix that”. And instead of having those sort of conversations, tell us what you’re going to do in the future because the election is around the corner … The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has confirmed he is considering a levy on banks to help maintain services in regional areas, saying he has not finalised any decision. Chalmers has told ABC TV that it was no secret that regional banking services were under pressure, and he routinely consulted the banks on what could be done about it. This is not an especially new thing that we’d be talking to the banks about some of these sorts of challenges. I think every Australian in the bush understands that there has been a withdrawal of services. As the government – which governs for the whole country – we’re very focused on that, and so we engage in these consultations and conversations from time to time. We don’t have a concluded view. We have a respectful relationship with the major financial institutions. We like to work together where we can. We like to consult where we can. He said recent media reports about the possible levy should be “seen in that light”. Holmes à Court says ‘many weaknesses in the bill’ Clive Palmer has flagged a possible high court challenge to the electoral reforms – does he have a case? Simon Holmes à Court argued there are “many weaknesses in the bill” and said he’s “not sure which one [Palmer’s] going after.” He instead pointed to a case in Victoria: There’s an interesting case brewing in Victoria where a group of independent candidates at the last state election are challenging the Victorian laws – which these federal laws seem to be significantly based on. In the Victorian system, the major parties can nominate an entity from which they can receive unlimited funds. So, for example, the $120m Cormack Foundation is allowed to circumvent the donation caps and give as much as it wants to the Liberal party. No such arrangement exists for independents. This group of independents believe that that violates the constitutional right to political communication and are progressing a high court challenge on that. That’s really one to watch, because this new legislation brings in a similar exemption, such that the federal parties will be able to raid their slush funds. But anyone who’s new to politics won’t be able to set up one of these funds. Holmes à Court says electoral reform law being ‘rammed through’ Simon Holmes à Court was asked what the electoral reform would mean for future and existing teal candidates running with the assistance of Climate 200. He told ABC RN that the changes would “make it harder for community campaigns to win”. He said the sole reason for the existence of Climate 200 is to “level that playing field” because as it stands, it is “already too hard for for independents to run against the party machines”. It’s too early to say how deeply this will affect the model. Between the explanatory memorandum and the legislative mission, there are 410 pages. So people are just starting to get into this, and it’s complex stuff. The definition of a political gift spans four pages, and two of those pages are exceptions. This is a very complex set of changes, the biggest changes to electoral laws since 1984 and it’s being rammed through. Holmes à Court argued there was talk there wouldn’t be a Senate inquiry or public consultation on the matter and “this is just going to get rammed through”. We’re very concerned. We don’t understand the rush these, these reforms don’t come in until 2026 so there is time for those processes. But clearly the major parties aren’t welcoming scrutiny for this bill. Simon Holmes à Court on proposed electoral reforms Climate 200 founder, Simon Holmes à Court, spoke with ABC RN this morning about the government’s proposed electoral law reform. Paul Karp has an explainer on this, which you can read below: Holmes à Court said there are “some good bits” to the bill, including the fact “it’s going to kill Clive Palmer’s business model”, but said it “tilts the playing field even further favour of the major parties”. We’ve already got an electoral system that gives massive advantages to the two major parties. This is going to entrench that [and] put up a wall around incumbency and build a moat, making it hard for outsiders to come in. Climate 200 has calculated the likely increase in the amount the Labor and Liberal parties could claim in public funding at the 2028 election, showing they will reap a combined $140m under the proposed changes. You can read all the details on this here. Holmes à Court said this was taxpayer money and “no justification has been given”. Which is quite incredible, quite courageous, really, that the government is proposing this in a cost-of-living crisis. The state of play for this sitting fortnight As we flagged just earlier, there are more than 30 pieces of legislation scheduled to be considered this sitting fortnight – as well as the electoral reform proposals. For the full details on what’s ahead, Josh Butler has written this fantastic explainer: The Greens will push Labor to legislate their pledge to cut 20% of student debt immediately and not wait until after the next election when the federal government’s student support bill is debated today. The measures, announced in the federal budget, would cut around $3bn in student debt by capping the indexation rate for Hecs and Help loans – tying them to whichever is lower of the consumer price index (CPI) or wage price index (WPI). The legislation would be retrospective and backdated to 2023, turning back the clock on last year’s indexation rate of 7.1%. In amendments to be put forward by deputy Greens leader and higher education spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, the Greens will challenge Labor to legislate further election promises on student debt immediately. The pledges, announced earlier this month, would wipe 20% of current student debts, raise the minimum repayment income to $67,000 and change to a marginal repayment rate. Faruqi told Guardian Australia spiralling student debt must be tackled “immediately”. My amendments will be a chance for Labor to show they actually care about those struggling under the weight of student debt right now. There is absolutely no reason to wait to legislate these changes until after the next election. It’s frankly irresponsible and cruel to be dangling student debt relief to win votes for an election when Labor is in government and we have the opportunity and the numbers to do this now. Happy Monday, and welcome back to the Australian politics live blog as we enter the final two sitting weeks of this year’s parliament. There are more than 30 pieces of legislation set to be considered this fortnight, which could shape the looming election, just months away. Questions remain as to whether – or how – the government will negotiate its bills that remain stalled in the Senate, with the prime minister declaring the government’s position “is final” on key legislation. This includes the Help to Buy, mis- and disinformation, Future Made in Australia, Nature Positive and aged care bills. Overnight, the Greens signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone – the second concession on stalled legislation from the party in less than a week. Anthony Albanese has just wrapped up the Apec economic forum in Peru, and will now attend the G20 leaders’ summit in Brazil, where the climate crisis is expected to be a focus and the PM may meet with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. We will have Richard Marles as acting prime minister in his place. Meanwhile, the Greens are set to push Labor to legislate their pledge to cut 20% of student debt immediately and not wait until after the next election, when the federal government’s student support bill is debated today. Caitlin Cassidy will bring us those exclusive details in a moment. I’m Emily Wind and I’ll be helming the live blog this fortnight. As always, the whole Canberra team will be working to bring you the latest – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Sarah Basford Canales, as well as Mike Bowers capturing all the action.

          "headline": "Some Nationals disgruntled by Labor’s electoral spending caps as crossbench fury grows",
          "bodyText": "Some Nationals are disgruntled the Albanese government’s electoral bill will deliver more money to party head offices, but Labor is still hoping to pass spending and donation caps with opposition support. On Monday Labor shut down a bid by the independent MP Kate Chaney to send its proposed reforms to an inquiry, as crossbench fury over the bill grew. Chaney told the house the major parties were “relying on the increasing disengagement of the public” to pass the bill without scrutiny. But the fate of the electoral reform and electoral communications bills, introduced in the House of Representatives on Monday, will hinge on the Coalition, from which Labor believes it has in-principle support. On Monday at a meeting of the junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, Senator Matt Canavan queried the reforms. Canavan later equivocated, telling ABC TV he had not seen evidence that political donations influence party policy, but the way to “minimise that concern is to have the funding made in a public fashion”. “We do need to run campaigns and I also think there’s an issue with large donors coming into the system which distort democratic process. “It’s just about finding a balance here – the cap shouldn’t be too low to deny new entrants, deny others participating in the democratic process, but there probably needs to be some restraint on unlimited amounts of money.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Another parliamentarian, who insisted on anonymity to speak frankly about internal deliberations, told Guardian Australia they were concerned the reforms would “further centralise” campaigns. The reforms raise the public funding of elections to $5 per vote and grant administrative funding of $30,000 per MP and $15,000 per senator to party head offices to deal with more onerous disclosure requirements. The parliamentarian argued these measures would be “worse” for MPs and senators who would be “hamstrung” by caps that make it harder to raise local funds for local campaigns, with centralised funds used as “another management tool” for enforcing party discipline. “I don’t want more nodding monkeys controlled out of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.” The shadow finance minister, Liberal senator Jane Hume, remained tight-lipped about the package, although the crossbench treated the Coalition’s decision not to support its push for an inquiry as further evidence of a major party deal. “The legislation has only been introduced today,” a spokesperson for Hume said. “As usual, it will go through our party room processes and we will determine our position after that.” Independents and minor parties have queried why the legislation, which will not take effect until July 2026 after the 2025 election, must pass this fortnight. Chaney attempted to send the reforms to an inquiry to report by 3 March, but the motion was defeated 50 votes to 14, with the crossbench united but Coalition MPs abstaining. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, told the lower house that if the legislation “is as good as the government says it is, then they will have nothing to hide from an inquiry”. Chaney told the house the major parties were leaning on “the complexity of this bill, the crowded media space” to “[rush] it through to get away with the only path they’ve got left to arrest the trend of declining support for the sclerotic leadership the two parties offer to the public”. In a show of force 11 MPs and senators, including senator David Pocock and seven teal MPs whose campaigns raised more than the $800,000 proposed cap for an electorate-level campaign, fronted the media to oppose the bill. “We will not be hoodwinked by this blatant attempt to lock out political competition,” Chaney told reporters. If the reforms pass, the major parties could reap an estimated additional $82.7m in higher public funding and $16.5m in administrative funding if they maintain their vote share from the 2022 election at the 2028 poll, according to an analysis by funding aggregator Climate 200. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie said major parties “have their snouts in the trough so far that they’re blowing that many bubbles I could jump in and have a bubble bath”. “There is nothing I can think of worse, towards the end of the year, the end of sittings, and all the major parties are worried about is money and trying to maintain their seats. “Here’s a good idea: why don’t you go and do what we all have to do – go earn [votes], instead of buying them.” The independent MP Andrew Wilkie labelled the major parties “self-serving political dinosaurs”. Earlier, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Pat Gorman, told the house the bills would “remove the influence of big money in politics, ensuring that our electoral system remains a system we can all trust”. “Trust that election results are not unfairly skewed by big money. Trust that elections are a contest of ideas, not bank balances. “Trust that we know who is funding election campaigns with more information about campaign financing provided before voting day.”"

          "headline": "England thrash Ireland as Carsley signs off with Nations League promotion",
          "bodyText": "It was an England salvo of devastating power, three goals in five minutes early in the second half and it did more than reframe an occasion that had been flat and forgettable up until then. It gave Lee Carsley the win that he wanted on his sixth and final game as the interim manager; one to seal England’s promotion back into the Nations League’s A section. With five wins and just that one off-night against Greece at Wembley, it added up to job well done. Carsley will hand over to Thomas Tuchel with the team in good health, a new generation also pushed. Carsley had previously given first caps to Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke, Curtis Jones, Lewis Hall and Morgan Rogers. Here, there were two more debuts – for Tino Livramento from the outset and Taylor Harwood-Bellis as a substitute. What a night it would be for both, especially Harwood-Bellis, who scored with a thumping header with one of his first touches from a Jude Bellingham cross. That made it 5-0. Ireland were long since broken, Harry Kane – who else? – precipitating an alarming crash. Kane was back in the starting XI after his high-profile omission from Thursday’s 3-0 win over Greece in Athens and, after he laboured dreadfully in the first half, it was his sumptuous pass that got Bellingham in to win a penalty off Liam Scales, the Republic of Ireland defender’s woe compounded when the foul was deemed to be a second yellow card offence. Kane scored from the spot, his 69th England goal in 103 caps. But this was a night for the next wave because it was not just Harwood-Bellis who found the net for the first time at this level. Anthony Gordon, Conor Gallagher and Jarrod Bowen did likewise, Ireland’s 10 men swept aside. Newcastle’s Livramento provided the cross for his clubmate Gordon to hook home a volley while Gallagher touched home after Marc Guéhi had flicked on a Madueke corner. That completed the flurry for England but they were in no mood to stop, the remorseless Bellingham teeing up Bowen after a well-worked free-kick routine. Bowen had only just come on as a substitute. The game had been framed in part by the first meeting between the nations in this group in September, when Ireland were disappointing in the 2-0 loss in Dublin. Few England fans expected anything other than victory here and not only because Ireland were depleted by injuries, missing a handful of likely starters. England would have to wait, the first half a virtual write-off from their point of view. Heimir Hallgrímsson set Ireland up in a 4-5-1 formation, the captain Nathan Collins – a centre-half by trade – sitting in front of the defence. The idea was to be compact, committed, hard to break down. Madueke, fresh from his barnstorming performance in the win over Greece, had one early run past two green shirts. His pull-back found its way to Curtis Jones, whose shot was deflected over. Kyle Walker headed off target from the corner and the first half descended into stodgy fare. England were slow to move it in possession, the patterns predictable. With 11 men banked behind the ball, Ireland kept Carsley’s team in front of them with ease. Kane’s toils in the first half were pronounced. It was unfortunate that Bellingham chose to put him in a foot-race with Collins midway through the period, which he was never going to win. Still, it was a bad look. Moments earlier, Kane had failed to control a clipped ball into the area from Hall; it was all so tight. There was a heavy touch from Kane that led to Scales slamming into him to win a showy tackle and the frustrations seemed to bubble over in first-half stoppage time, Kane throwing Jayson Molumby to the ground to incur a yellow card. Madueke had been booked earlier for a foul on Callum O’Dowda, with Bellingham’s complaints about the decision earning him a yellow card. He was also booked for dissent in Athens and he will be suspended for England’s next game. Ireland had shouted loudly for two penalties before the interval, the first when Guéhi had a handful of Evan Ferguson’s shirt as they tussled. The second came when Walker stooped to guide a header back to Jordan Pickford, blocking Sammie Szmodics in the process, who tumbled over. It was risky from Walker. The referee, Erik Lambrechts, did not see enough in either appeal. He could easily have given the first. That only deepened Ireland’s frustration after the break when England got the penalty to completely turn the game around. Never write off Kane. It has become a truism. It was the captain whose masterpiece of a pass provided the spark, a flat and perfectly calibrated diagonal from the left putting Bellingham up against Scales in the area. He jinked inside; Scales lunged and caught him. When the penalty was awarded, Gordon turned and simply applauded Kane. Kane did what he does, a little stutter in his run-up before he banged past Caoimhín Kelleher. The red card for Scales was a body blow for Ireland. They would continue to rain down."

          "bodyText": "I have a vivid memory of arriving at university at the back end of the 1980s and telling someone I needed to buy a bread cake, at which point I remembered (too late!) that most people call the round baked item in question a bap or a roll. The term bread cake – no, it has nothing whatsoever to do with cake – is highly regional: a South Yorkshire and, at a push, East Midlands thing. If I’d been wearing a Tracey Emin-style neon sign on my head that said, “I am from elsewhere, possibly another planet”, I couldn’t have announced myself more clearly. Not that I was embarrassed – and in any case, old habits die hard. On Sunday mornings, when I make bacon sandwiches, the floury baps that I like to use, soft as pillows, are still bread cakes to me. They always will be. The experience I describe was, however, a long time ago and, today, as I think about making pease pudding for dinner (I’m joking; of course we’re having pasta), I find myself wondering about regional differences when it comes to food. Do they belong, now, to the past? Admittedly, it’s still hard to lay your hands on parkin in London: Gail’s Bakery looks to Europe, not Leeds, its nose in the air and a silk scarf tied firmly around its neck. But Eccles cakes and Cornish pasties are ubiquitous now, and I’ve seen haslet with my own eyes at the Islington branch of Tesco (a herby meat loaf, haslet is very good in bread cakes, so long as they’re thickly buttered). Neal’s Yard Dairy, the fine cheesemonger, sells Staffordshire oatcakes. Leave the capital, meanwhile, and you will find that a sourdough-and-rocket-inflected monotony is spreading ever outwards from the M25. Except … uh oh. Nature does abhor a vacuum, and where once we had Dorothy Hartley’s classic of 1954, Food in England, to guide us from county to county, now we have Deliveroo, whose latest sales data has helpfully provided an alternative and highly 21st-century map of the nation’s tastes. Some of them are entirely predictable – in the north, people are more likely to order chips with curry sauce – and others are downright weird (I cannot think what kind of person panic-orders scones on such an app, but apparently they mostly live in Glasgow). Geographically speaking, York is now the capital of bubble tea, Brighton of oat milk, and Tunbridge Wells of champagne. The media swallowed Deliveroo’s press release wholesale, no questions asked, and thanks to this I was able to study its findings in a newspaper for several moments while eating (I’ll use an uncontroversial word) a sandwich. How bewildering, and how melancholy. While some of my neighbours adopted delivery apps with alacrity – a liveried bicycle arrives at one house in our street virtually every day – I’ve never used Deliveroo, and don’t plan on doing so any time soon. But even if I did, I wouldn’t think of ordering a latte from Costa Coffee (Blackpool), or a rice bowl from Leon (Bath). What strange cravings! These are businesses whose success, at least in part, is built on convenience: you are there, they are there, the train you plan to get boards in 10 minutes. They strike me as last resorts, not the ne plus ultra of a good night in. There are many dispiriting phrases in the English language; I have mentioned before how much I hate to hear anyone say, “I’m not having a starter.” But “eight pieces boneless from Wingstop” is right up there with the worst words I’ve ever heard spoken out loud (according to Deliveroo, the trending food of the past year was chicken, and this easy-to-eat octet from Wingstop, an American chain with 55 outlets in Britain, “took the top spot”). Ordinary as they may sound to some ears, those words seem to me to encapsulate something: an unstoppable blandification; a refusal to recognise both the value of difference and the danger of ignoring it. Even as I cling to cheese, the one food that has improved beyond all imagining on these islands in my lifetime, I worry about what we’re losing. All I can do – all any of us can do – is to go on performing our small acts of resistance. Bread cakes forever, and down with bicycles bearing oat milk."

          "bodyText": "Thank you for joining me for this North London derby. Arsenal walk away with the bragging rights after a clinical performance which saw them blow Spurs away 3-0. To recap all of the action have a read of the report below. That isn’t the end of the football action today as Chelsea host Manchester City at Stamford Bridge at 5.30 GMT. Our coverage for that game starts in just over half an hour, see you there. Player of the match Frida Maanum told the BBC: “This game means a lot for us, Arsenal and the fans. To paint London red is really nice. “They made a huge impact today, you can see that in all the games this season subs always make an impact. “We are just focusing on each game now, we are enjoying our time under Renee and we will see what happens.” Alessia Russo told the BBC: “Today was massive, not only is it a step in the league but it is the North London derby. I am feeling really good, I’m enjoying myself. “I think we are a little bit more comfortable. She [Renee Slegers] has allowed us a bit more freedom. The Arsenal players hold hands as a squad and run towards the thousands of away fans in the stadium. Huge support for the Gunners. Tottenham remain seventh after that loss. They are four points outside of the relegation spot. Arsenal were dominant in the first half with good goals from Russo and Maanum. Spurs started the second 45 well but they just couldn’t puncture Arsenal’s defence when they had the momentum and their bubble burst when Blackstenius scored. The Gunners remain in fourth but they are still unbeaten under interim boss Slegers. 90 + 3 min: Arsenal came close there with a lovely ball into the area but Spurs marked their opposite players well to not allow them enough space to take a shot. 90 + 1 min: There will be four minutes added. Catley gets a yellow card for time wasting. 90 min: Spurs just look like they want this game to be over, they are putting together some passes but Arsenal win it back after two or three. In all honesty they look exhausted. The BBC have named Maanum as player of the match. 88 min: Buhler is hobbling and clasping her ankle after a tackle, she looks as though she is trying to walk it off so she is staying on the pitch. 86 min: Another yellow card, this time for Summanen for a foul on Cooney-Cross. The last 10 minutes of this one is getting fiery. Arsenal are making another change with Wubben-Moy on for McCabe. Spurs make a double change with Vinberg and Gunning-Williams coming on for Naz and Raso. 84 min: Williamson has stayed down after putting in a tackle but she is okay to continue. 82 min: Cooney-Cross has put in a huge tackle on Nilden but the referee isn’t dipping into her pocket for a card and on the replay it is the right decision 80 min: Cooney-Cross gets a yellow card for a foul on Spence. The hosts have a free kick but its in their own half and so they will have to build from deep. Arsenal make another change with Caldentey off for Kafaji and Spurs make a change with Spence off for Thomas. 78 min: Cooney-Cross rifles off a shot from inside her own half as she spots Spencer off of her line but it doesn’t trouble the keeper. 76 min: Summanen plays it short to Spence who takes a shot but Van Domselaar reads it well to save. 74 min: Spurs fans must be so frustrated watching this. Tottenham weren’t good in the first half but they looked bright in the second but they have still conceded. They have a chance now as McCabe gives away a free kick. 72 min: Poor play from Spurs sees Blackstenius pick up a loose ball but she goes for the wrong option and so the chance comes to nothing. Mead will be fuming as she had acres of space. 71 min: The stadium comes alive as Naz gets in the area but her cross is cleared and Arsenal counter. It comes to Blackstenius but she is muscled off of the ball. End-to-end action. 69 min: Some Spurs fans are leaving the game after that third goal, the camera then pans to Arsenal fans who are spinning scarfs around in celebration. Spurs make a change with Hunt off for Ahtinen. I think it was her third touch that goal and her second was a shot over the bar. Blackstenius was fed the ball and it ends up being a one-on-one with Spencer and she pops the ball in the bottom right corner. That’s the game now surely. Immediate impact. 65 min: Arsenal make a double change with Mead and Blackstenius on for Russo and Foord. 63 min: Russo tries to lay the ball off to McCabe but she doesn’t interact with it as she knows she is offside, if that run was better timed that could have been goal number three. 61 min: The crowd sound like they are getting restless with Arsenal playing a lot of their football in the midfield, where they aren’t being challenged by Spurs at all. They eventually get into the box with Russo crossing to Foord who can’t turn it in from a tight angle. 59 min: Arsenal put together some slick attack with one-two passes. However, Raso does well to initially repel the chance but Arsenal just keep coming. 57 min: Spurs win it back, they have every part of their game firing at the moment bar the final shot. This time they find Naz but she is then ruled offside. 56 min: Foord barges into Neville, her Spurs teammates check if she is okay and she doesn’t need treatment. Spurs have a free kick from the foul, the delivery is good and Walti sees it out for a corner. England is over the corner ball but the delivery isn’t good. 54 min: Hunt is shown a yellow card for a shirt pull and Arsenal have a free kick in a good position. McCabe takes the set piece again and it’s very similar to the ones she has taken all game, straight at Spencer who collects. 52 min: Spurs put a beautiful move together but Nilden’s pass back inside is mopped up by Cooney-Cross. They are knocking on the door and they look the more likely to score. If they are the next to hit the back of the net this derby will get tasty. 50 min: Naz escapes up the right and boos rain down as Catley hits the deck and a free kick allows Arsenal to clear. The hosts quickly win it back, this has been a bright start to the second half for Spurs but they need to capitalise on their momentum. 49 min: Foord has a good run but Hunt marks her well to see the resulting pass reach the feet of a Spurs player. 47 min: Tottenham have all of the early second half ball but they haven’t managed to do anything meaningful with it. Can Spurs fight back? Or will Arsenal seal bragging rights? All to come. Cooney-Cross is coming on for Arsenal, replacing Little. Here’s news from elsewhere in the sport: Elsewhere in the league, Brighton have beaten West Ham 3-2 with Fran Kirby scoring a late winner. Katrina Gorry had scored two goals in five minutes to equalise for the Hammers but Kirby was the Seagulls hero. It was a shocking start from Spurs who conceded in the first two minutes through Russo and Maanum doubled their lead. Tottenham have grown into the game with a great chance by England forcing a brilliant save from Van Domselaar. It’s all to play for. 45 + 3 min: McCabe gives away a free kick and the resulting delivery wins Spurs a corner. Summanen delivers the corner but it’s skied over the bar. 45 + 2 min: McCabe takes a free kick but it’s a weak shot which Spencer mops up. 45 + 1 min: Bartrip’s clearance sees another Arsenal corner, the camera angle made it look like that was going in her own goal but it’s wide. The corner is played short, McCabe crosses it in but Nilden sees it out for a throw in. Fox is then tripped by Raso who gives away a free kick. There will be two minutes added. 44 min: A lull in the game at the moment, end-to-end football but no clear shot from either side. 42 min: Caldentey takes the free kick but it is directly at Spencer who was able to save easily. 40 min: Spence blocks a cross with handball and she gives away a free kick. She is also a bit lucky as she is already on a yellow card but the referee doesn’t show her a second one. 39 min: Tottenham had a really positive spell there for a minute or two but they’ve backed off a bit now with Arsenal pulling all of the strings. 37 min: England takes it, the delivery is good but it’s punched away by the keeper. England sends it in again but Fox sees it out for another corner. Spurs wanted a penalty in amongst that with a foul in the box but it isn’t given. The corner is taken and Naz has a shot but Van Domselaar easily saves. 36 min: What a save from Van Domselaar, that was huge. Spence intercepts a ball and she passes to England who rockets a shot at goal but the keeper sends it over the bar. A corner to come. 35 min: Raso puts on heaps of pressure on Van Domselaar and the keeper only just manages to get it away. Some pressure ensues from Spurs but Arsenal clear their lines. Possession exchanges hands and then Spurs win a free kick where they can relieve some pressure. 33 min: Maanum sends it in again but Spencer reads it well to collect. 31 min: I thought the loose play out the back would eventually see them concede, this time Walti pounces and wins a corner. Maanum is over this one, it’s a great delivery but no one can turn it in. Foord gets contact but her shot is out for another corner. 29 min: England is back to her feet and I think she is okay to continue but when she reaches the sidelines, as she received treatment, she leans over on her knees and grimaces. She does re-enter the game. 28 min: Spurs wanted a free kick there for a challenge on England, she stays down as it looks like she has been hit in the face. The referee eventually blows but the Spurs captain has not moved yet. Hopefully she is okay. 26 min: Spence goes into the book for a foul on Foord. The challenge has given Arsenal a free kick with Maanum and McCabe standing over it, it is the Norway international who takes it but it is a poor delivery and it goes straight out. 24 min: Spencer looks so frustrated in goal, she has just signed a new deal with the club as she has documented her skills in goal but her form has slipped of late. The defence again shaky for Spurs and Spencer has a poor attempted save too. The amount of space Arsenal players have is crazy. It was coming. 21 min: Foord comes close again. She is desperate for a goal today. She has scored seven goals against Tottenham and she wants to add to her tally. Tottenham break forward through England and Naz but the resulting cross results in a Arsenal free kick with Spence fouling Russo, the chance is gone. 19 min: Spurs have had some possession but they do not look like a threat at all when they try and create an attack. That is in part to Arsenal’s pace, they are absolutely everywhere at the moment. 17 min: Nilden blocks a shot from Foord, a really good tackle again from the defender. It doesn’t take long for Arsenal to get back into the box with a McCabe cross but it is headed away. It feels like a matter of time before the visitors double their lead. 15 min: Arsenal rapidly get the ball through the team to carve Spurs open, the hosts’ defence has been better but they still aren’t up to the mark. 13 min: Spurs are continually playing out of the back despite the fact they don’t seem completely comfortable with it. They need to be more confident with their passes in that area because Arsenal are pressing and they could pounce on a loose ball. 11 min: Arsenal get in the box once again and it falls to Fox but her shot is blocked. The Gunners keep pressing but they can’t find a way through this time. 9 min: Raso has a good run and tries to pick out England but it has too much on it so Van Domselaar has time to rid the danger. 7 min: Nilden does really well to time her tackle on Foord in the box, some slick Arsenal passing meant she needed to dispossess her there as Caldentey was lurking. The tackle does concede a corner with McCabe sending it in. It’s not clean in the box but eventually Spencer collects. 6 min: There is no high press from Spurs, Arsenal’s backline have been able to pass between themselves for some time before they decide to move up the pitch. The attack ends in a goal kick but it has been all Arsenal so far. 4 min: Spurs also conceded after 20 seconds against Manchester City last weekend and it is the same old story. They now need to have a flawless game to get back into this. A horror start from Tottenham, Arsenal completely dominant and Spurs’ defence is so weak. No one tracks Russo who strikes cleanly. Wow. Oh my word. Here we go. Is there a bigger game in club football? It is most definitely up there. The rivalry is re-ignited, Kim Little and Beth England are leading their sides out and so let’s get down to business. The players will be out on the pitch soon with a good crowd at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for this one. Can Spurs cause an upset? Or will Arsenal come out on top? All to come. Leah Williamson and Kim Little reach their 150th WSL appearances today and they have joined a select group. They join Jordan Nobbs and Millie Bright for wracking up 150 games at one club. Are you at a game today? If you are get in touch and let me know what the stadium food is like. One of my favourite social media accounts is football scran, which details what clubs have available. I must confess I have treated myself to a takeaway to get prepped for this mega day of football. The North London derby is not the only rivalry re-igniting this weekend with the Merseyside derby taking place tomorrow. Tom Garry spoke to Everton manager Brian Sørensen about the match: Spurs boss Robert Vilahamn has labelled Arsenal favourites this weekend, saying: “Arsenal have been in the game longer than us and won a lot. We are the underdogs, can accept that now, but in the long run in this derby, we want to be expected to win home games.” Arsenal’s interim boss, who is making a claim for the permanent role, Renée Slegers said of Tottenham: “I think Tottenham are a strong team. They’ve been playing a top four opposition in quite a lot of games already, which are tough games. I think they might be stronger than the results they’ve had so far. So, we’re really respectful of them as an opponent, they have some individual qualities. I think they show great mentality and do things together. So, it’s going to be very hard opponent. But again, I think if we keep on bringing what we’re bringing, I think we’re a top team.” The team news is in. Tottenham make two changes from their defeat to Manchester City last time out. Ella Morris and Matilda Vinberg drop out for Hayley Raso and Amanda Nilden. Tottenham: Spencer, Neville, Buhler, Hunt, Nilden, Bartrip, Summanen, Spence, Raso, Naz England.. Arsenal, meanwhile, make one change with Beth Mead benched in favour of Mariona Caldentey. Leah Williamson and Kim Little make their 150th WSL appearances. Arsenal: Van Domselaar, Fox, Williamson, Catley, Mariona, Little (C), McCabe, Maanum, Walti, Foord, Russo Hello and welcome to the North London derby in the Women’s Super League. This fixture last season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium created history as Spurs beat Arsenal for the first time in the league, the home crowd will be hoping for a similar result this afternoon. However, that will prove tricky as Arsenal have hit some good form over the past few weeks. Last weekend they defeated Brighton, who are having a good season themselves, 5-0. The Gunners then followed that up with a thumping 4-0 win over Juventus in the Women’s Champions League. So Spurs do have their work cut out for them. Tottenham have had a bumpy start to the season and are seventh after only two wins this campaign. But a victory at home in front of a bumper crowd could jumpstart some consistency to their season. We will take a look at what has been said in the build-up shortly but first let’s take a look at the team news before kick-off at 1.45pm GMT."

          "bodyText": "Nobody’s home. Not in the young woman with the big headphones cycling against the light. Not in the person in the middle of the crossing staring at their phone, or the person talking to someone who’s not there and ignoring the one they’re pushing in the baby carriage, or the distracted driver who doesn’t seem to notice those cyclists and pedestrians. So I move through a world of people who are not all the way there and sometimes hardly there at all – and who don’t seem to want anyone else to be there either. Aversion to direct contact with others has become so normal in my home town – San Francisco, a city swallowed up by Silicon Valley – that I’ve become avoidant myself after too many encounters with people who seem to find it bafflingly transgressive to engage with any casual remark or question from a stranger, and mostly fail to respond. I wander in a city that feels ghostly, depopulated, even when bodies are on the street, and I feel like a ghost myself in the lack of acknowledgment, in others’ blank reluctance to utter even those tiny “excuse me” negotiations to get around someone or warn someone. The pandemic emptied out the streets, but this is another kind of emptiness – it often seems as though fewer people are out and about, but also the people still present are a lot less present. Had this happened overnight it would be a sci-fi horror movie scenario – people seeming numbed, dazed, their attention captured and manipulated by the contents of tiny devices controlled by powerful corporations, a billion Manchurian candidates in a wifi-equipped Metropolis. A Night of the Living Dead to You. But it’s happened so incrementally it’s become normal for us all to be in that limbo, that bardo. * * * All of which is to say, welcome to my zombie movie, which I daresay is also yours to some extent. San Francisco still has its walkable, dense cityscape, but no longer the sense – especially among the young and affluent – that it is a place you belong to by connecting. Rightwing tech bros and conservative media have pushed hard at the idea that San Francisco is a scary, dangerous place to walk around in, so much so that when a friend came to the city, his Lyft driver repeated the idea that he – a tall, fit ex-New Yorker – should quail at the idea of traversing our streets. They are, in one way, a little more dangerous: if people out in public keep each other safe as potential witnesses and participants, the withdrawal from paying attention, the reluctance to intervene, makes us less safe. I am not confident a lot of the people I pass by would do anything more than take out their phones to record an assault, if they noticed and stopped at all. And, after decades of decline, pedestrian fatalities have risen nationwide at the hands of distracted drivers (the extent to which distracted pedestrians also play a role has been less studied and, of course, the arguments for the driverless cars now cruising around San Francisco could be that we need this technology because we’ve been captured by another one). So maybe it is less safe, not for the reasons they claim, but for reasons they’re complicit in. A lot of people seem to move through the streets as though they’re somehow both hostile and boring, and they are more boring now that people around us are less engaged and more enterprises are outlets of corporate chains such as Starbucks and Walgreens, so there’s nothing distinctive or local and no one lasting to get to know. The desire to withdraw, to seek smoothness and avoid the potential friction of contact, arises from the view that nonparticipation is self-protection, in contrast to the older idea that being urban is a participatory sport. Promenading, strolling to see and be seen, was a celebrated, desired part of urban life in the 19th and much of the 20th century, whether it meant showing off your Sunday finery on the boulevard or cruising the sidestreets under cover of darkness in search of erotic opportunities. The films of an earlier era feature jaunty boulevardiers or lady flaneurs moving from encounter to encounter. The detectives in classic film noir movies are masterful because they know cops, cabbies, bartenders, reporters, crooks, nightclub hat-check girls and everyone in between. They’re love songs to cities that are made out of connections and circulation. It’s true that after the golden age of such movies, we in the US had a few decades of high urban street crime, now long over; true that police have always been a menace to Black people, men to women – but the conviviality of the Black neighbourhood I lived in in the 80s, and the nearby gay neighbourhood I wandered through then, was real and, despite my own youthful experiences with street harassment, I have never stopped walking the city. Democracy itself is based in trust in strangers and a sense of having something in common with them (which is part of why xenophobia and fear of crime serve fascist agendas so well). Circulating freely among them – especially in the diverse places most cities are – helps inculcate this feeling; it gives you a sense of confidence, of being able to coexist with difference. It orients you, literally, and it’s very useful knowledge in an emergency. That’s what’s celebrated in those old movies and shunned in the rhetoric and designs of the new technologies. I suspect a lot of people are now if not outright disoriented, not really oriented to where they live. Unlike using a map to find your way, which gradually becomes superfluous as you internalise it, using an app means obeying instructions without grasping the underlying geography, so you never really learn where you are. As someone who learned to navigate several cities and regions before smartphones came in, I wonder about the spatial blur the phone-reliant inhabit, the lack of a mental picture of the terrain. As San Francisco awaits its next big earthquake, I also wonder how my most tech-dependent neighbours will cope when it comes and electricity, and likely cell phone towers, fail. This navigational withdrawal, like the others, is egged on by the new technologies, in part because it’s useful to them if everything we do is mediated by a product they’re selling, either directly because we bought the phone or paid for the service plan, or indirectly because, as the tech adage goes, “if it’s free, you’re the product”. When you’re on social media or using a search engine, it’s harvesting your data and collecting revenue from pushing targeted ads at you, unless you went through the acrobatics of opting out. Some of the old points of connection have disappeared – automatic toll machines replace the people in booths, self-checkout replaces the cash register, renewing your car registration, bill-paying and banking can be done online, as can buying almost anything. Other connection points are still there, but shunned. There’s a Middle Eastern deli run by a really nice guy I go to sometimes – the first time I went in he gave me some free falafel while I waited; he’s greeted me warmly every time since, but these days on the tables are signs for “contactless ordering”, in case you want to scan the QR code right there because walking the few steps up to the counter and speaking would be too much. Many restaurants have put their menus online and offer a QR code to access it even when you’re there in person, a dismal way to find out what’s on offer; a San Francisco mall has signs on its entrances offering a QR code to find out its hours, rather than simply putting them on the signs; sometimes filtering things through phones seems reflexive, even when direct information is easy to come by. Of course, you can just order takeaway and avoid contact almost entirely. I had a startling experience last year in a Mexican restaurant here – it was half-empty when we sat down and ordered dinner; an hour later it turned out our food hadn’t come because our order came in after dozens of online orders, which were being filled first. The kitchen was very busy, but not for those there in person. The takeaway boom, which works by pressuring restaurants to cut prices for the tech companies running the services carried out by underpaid workers, has created its own in-between, in which neither the creative labour of cooking your own dinner nor the gregariousness of eating out occurs. In between the wholly public space of city streets and parks and the entirely private space of home are the workplaces, cafes, restaurants and other social spaces in decline in various ways. For example, Silicon Valley has provided both the technology and the arguments for working from home, which has emptied out San Francisco’s centre and made it something of a ghost town, with the ripple effect of bankrupting sandwich shops and retail establishments there. (Cafes in this city had too often become de facto workplaces in which freelancers were silently absorbed in their screens, which prompted some to stop offering wifi and others to stop offering anything but takeaway drinks.) I recognise the benefits of being spared some of the lousy aspects of in-person work, including time-consuming commutes and related emissions, office attire, workplace sexual harassment. But it’s happened without much discussion of what else occurs in the workplace besides work, including friendships, mentorships, conversations, human contact and informal and formal worker solidarity. This is part of a larger shift towards pursuing the quantifiable – productivity, efficiency, profitability – while overlooking or devaluing the unquantifiable. The science journalist Victoria Atkinson wrote recently in praise of the coffee break. She states that in the labs she used to work in as a chemist, “from the very beginning of my time to now, years after leaving, I have found these pauses from work one of the most productive uses of my time”. This is because in the conversations around her when she was starting out, “I began to pick up the little bits and pieces of knowledge that make lab work quicker and easier – the kind of advice and information you’d never find in a paper or a departmental handbook.” She adds that “more than once, a suggestion over coffee led to an important breakthrough” and as she became more experienced, she became one of the participants offering, as well as receiving, guidance and took pleasure in that. It’s a small jump from there to the fact that the workplace once featured prominently among the ways couples used to meet. In the 80s, according to one study, the second most common way couples met was through work. Of course, now it’s primarily through online means, notably dating apps (and most of them are harvesting your data for sale to third parties). I’m all for love, but the rise of online services reflects the decline of other means of connecting. As unmediated in-person places and experiences get undermined by technology, we become yet more dependent on the technology, and that’s part of the horror movie. At the gym a few months ago, I spent at least 15 minutes waiting for a guy to get off the weight machine I wanted to use, a guy who would do a desultory short set of reps, then sit on the device scrolling through Grindr. The annoyance wasn’t so much that he was shopping for sex as that, for an exceptionally long stretch, he was doing something a lot of people in this gym do: use their phones to distract themselves between sets, but also to stay in the bubble that justifies their obliviousness to the people waiting for them to be finished. The mobile phone is not only a device offering you things to pay attention to but also offers you a way not to pay attention to other things. I could have forced Grindr guy to shake out of his trance and let me take a turn, but it would have been so unwelcome an act that I gave up instead. It was not my job to make someone who was wilfully anywhere-but-here show up. I suspect all these things are worse because I live in a city annexed by Silicon Valley, and I’ve lately found more civic joy in New York City and in Querétaro, Mexico. But the affliction is worldwide, and you’re in it, too. * * * Vampires have devoured our attention and left us the ghosts of public and civic and community life. Tech has sold us not only the capacity to withdraw but the logic of it, with the rhetoric – at least since the late 90s dotcom boom and the birth of online shopping and banking – that insists leaving the house, milling around, talking to strangers, going to your bank or the post office, or even eating out in a restaurant is inconvenient, unpleasant, unnecessary and possibly dangerous. Some of the justification for the withdrawal seems to be efficiency – the capitalist sense that time is money and you need to hoard the former so you can work incessantly to earn the latter. Another piece of it is the idea that the activities of daily life are so tedious and burdensome that you should try to avoid them. There are upscale counter-narratives that sometimes penetrate – think of baking sourdough bread during the pandemic, or knitting, or growing tomatoes, things that are not about getting ahead economically, but are about reconnecting to manual skills and activities, to seeing a process through rather than just getting the product, to slowing down rather than speeding up. In Zen training, just sweeping or washing the dishes can be an occasion for mindfulness, and being fully present – just doing that one thing with full attention, not being half there and half elsewhere – is an important part of the practice. Tech, by contrast, promotes ghosting your own embodied life and the systems that support it (though it also offers mindfulness apps you can install on your phone). The people designing and promoting and profiting off those technologies genuinely seem to both shun the turbulent, unpredictable world out there and to believe substitutes for direct and authentic human contact and experience are as good as the real thing – all the way down to virtual reality, virtual girlfriends and AI therapists. There is no shortage of actual human beings, but society is increasingly organised – in no small part by these merchants of withdrawal – to make it harder to connect, which becomes the justification for pushing these substitutes. We’re now in the midst of an international loneliness pandemic whose impact on mental – and even physical – health, as well as happiness, is now a subject of medical concern. If you object that we’re not in a zombie movie because there are no brain-eating cannibals, let me reassure you, there are. The corporations are devouring our attention, and chewing our lives down to the bone to get at our data. They have shown their ruthlessness in what they offer as long as they capture us and extract our attention, information and other assets from us. And the harm is real. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (parent company of Facebook and Instagram) turned a blind eye to Facebook Messenger being used for the Rohingya genocide a few years back or for organising extremist militias on Facebook now. Meta’s Instagram is clearly fine with teenage body issues, social anxiety and suicides as long as the profits roll in, and the same goes for X and TikTok when it comes to misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, or YouTube with algorithms pushing extremist content. All these sites have been used to corrupt elections, and X owner Elon Musk himself promoted extremist content and misinformation as he toiled to elect Donald Trump. It’s not nearly well-enough known that Jair Bolsanaro, the far-right Brazilian president from 2019-23, rose to power and prominence thanks to his YouTube videos and the algorithm’s promotion of them. This means the destruction of the Amazon and attacks on indigenous groups during Bolsanaro’s time in office can be traced back in part to YouTube’s parent company Google/Alphabet in Silicon Valley. At the far end of this nightmare is China’s Orwellian surveillance society, in which few activities are free of government oversight and violation of the rules leads to dire consequences. The new technologies have created a whole realm of new vulnerabilities. Identity theft, hacking, stalkerware and revenge porn are among the more literal kinds. Russian troll farms and manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists and incels have found ways to warp minds and instil corrosive beliefs. Young people are particularly vulnerable, and what happens to them when they’re sucked into the online world is widely linked to rises in bullying, sleep disorders, depression, loneliness, suicide, the intake of misinformation, the recruitment of white boys in particular into rightwing, racist and misogynist online spaces, and the decline of real face-to-face friendships. Some studies suggest youths’ susceptibility is tied to parental neglect due to the same causes, notably to parental “phubbing”, a word coined to describe the snubbing that occurs when someone is technically present but ignoring others by being absorbed in phone use. In a 2024 Pew study, 46% of American teenagers surveyed “say their parent is at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they’re trying to talk to them, including 8% who say this happens often”. Online social media and search engines, notably Google, cannibalise actual news-producing organisations and siphon off their ad revenue, notably that of newspapers, which are dying in the US at the rate of about two a week. That is, the very local ones are really dying out and even many of the big ones are gutting their staff, partly to stay afloat and partly because some of them now belong to investors who are stripping them for parts. With less local news there’s less local knowledge and civic participation, more room for corruption and unaccountable institutions (and while there are local news sites and blogs, podcasts and other online information sources that do a great job, they’re not reaching people the way a local newspaper once did or, for the most part, doing the kind of reporting newspapers do). Local news advocate Steven Waldman writes, “One study of toxic emissions at 40,000 plants found that when newspapers reported on pollution, emissions declined by 29% compared with plants that were not covered.” In a famous incident in 2002, a train derailed in a small North Dakota town and “five tank cars carrying anhydrous ammonia ruptured, filling the area with a poisonous gas cloud. But a public warning over radio wasn’t broadcast for nearly 90 minutes. One person died, and more than 300 were injured.” The problem was there was no longer a local radio station or other local means of raising the alarm, only corporate stations playing automated programmes. No one was home. I hear stories of young people consciously rejecting smart phones and online life, and finding ways to connect in person – but they’re salmon swimming upstream. Their resistance is valiant, but individual will is far from adequate to escape the grasp of these corporations and recommit to the fading world of the here and now and embodied and gregarious. I don’t have a sweeping solution, but I think recognising that one of our deepest human desires is to connect, to belong, to be at home, and that doing so is made up of innumerable small in-person acts, might be a start."

          "bodyText": "Champagne at prosecco prices? Every little helps. Tesco’s Finest champagne has triumphed over the prestigious French label Moët &amp; Chandon in a festive quaff test. The Tesco Finest premier cru brut champagne received the top score of 82% in a blind taste test conducted by the consumer group Which?. The £25-a-bottle bubbly was hailed by judges for its “nutty aroma and fresh, fruity flavours”. The supermarket fizz beat Moët &amp; Chandon, which scored 77% and at £44 is almost twice as expensive. Aldi’s Veuve Monsigny champagne was also a hit with the panel. It scored 80% and, like the Tesco fizz, secured the consumer champion’s coveted “best buy” gong. The £22 bubbly has an “aroma of crunchy green apples with a suggestion of pecans, spice and butterscotch”, according to the tasters. Waitrose’s brut NV champagne scored the same as Aldi and is also a “best buy”. At £25, it is described as having “pleasing peach, pear and apple flavours, and a superb nut and winter spice taste”. A champagne toast might be an annual festive tradition but with money tight in many households, Which? also road-tested cheaper sparkling wines. The cheapest of these, Lidl’s Prosecco Superiore Valdobbiadene, scored 80%. At £7.49, this budget bottle is an “excellent alternative to champagne, and perfect for Christmas parties”, it said. Natalie Hitchins, the Which? home products and services editor, said its panel had identified “affordable and delicious options that were dramatically cheaper than alternatives from the big-name champagne houses”. “Our taste tests show that you don’t have to spend over the odds for a supermarket champagne or sparkling wine that delivers on quality and value for money,” she said. The latest supermarket data revealed shoppers were already preparing for Christmas, and October sales figures showed households stocking cupboards with festive treats. While some complain of “Christmas creep” when mince pies arrive on shelves in September, Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at grocery industry analysts Kantar, said the consumer demand was there. Last month, 648,000 shoppers bought a Christmas cake, while 14.4% of households picked up mince pies, he said. So, if mince pie season is already in full swing, which ones should you buy? Luckily Which? has also put posh supermarket mince pie brands through their paces so you don’t have to. While Tesco’s and Asda’s offerings fell flat, not for the first time, Waitrose’s No 1 brown butter mince pies won the day and, at £4 for six, are a “best buy”. Aldi Specially Selected mince pies also impressed the judges with a “great buttery taste and tasty filling”. “The competition was fierce this year, but Waitrose was the only winner of our “best buy” endorsement,” said Hitchins. However, for those looking for a more affordable option, Aldi’s pies – at £2.29 for six or 38p per pie – are “tasty but don’t break the bank”."

          "headline": "Typhoo Tea to call in administrators amid sales slump",
          "bodyText": "Typhoo Tea is to call in administrators, as Britain’s oldest tea brand struggles with more than £70m in debt amid a sales slump in the highly competitive drinks market. The 121-year-old company has filed a court notice to appoint administrators EY to explore rescue options, in a bid to give it some breathing space from creditors and to try to pay back its debts. Typhoo, which was founded in 1903 by the Birmingham grocer John Sumner, has been struggling for a number of years as many drinkers have switched from tea to coffee, energy drinks and newer trends such as bubble tea. Tea consumption has been in decline for years, with the research firm Mintel forecasting an 8% fall between 2023 and 2028. “This action has been taken to enable us to pursue a sale of the business,” said Dave McNulty, the chief executive of Typhoo. “This does not mean that we are in administration. Given the delicate nature of this we are not in a position to comment any further.” Sales at the company, which employs about 100 people, fell from £34m to £25m in the year to the end of September 2023, the most recent results available. Losses ballooned from £9.6m to £38m year on year because of a redundancy programme and a trespassing incident at its sole factory in Moreton, Wirral. The company was still in the process of implementing its transformation plan – including scrapping unprofitable product lines, closing its “inefficient and unsuitable” factory in favour of using co-packing partners, and making redundancies – when trespassers took over the site for “several days”, causing huge amounts of damage. In total, the company took charges of £24m in relation to its restructuring plans and impairment to the Typhoo brand, property and machinery. Included in this figure is just over £2.5m paid in staff redundancy costs last year. Typhoo subsequently recovered £4.3m from an insurance claim related to the trespassing incident, and a gross sales price of £4.6m from the sale of the factory and its land. “The abrupt closure of the Typhoo factory as a result of the trespassing incident necessitated the relocation of production to third parties faster than anticipated,” the company said. “This led to significantly higher direct expenses, impairment of assets and inefficiencies on production as our co-packing partners ramped up their production.” Despite the mounting problems at the business, the accounts show that directors and key management personnel were paid £1.2m last year, with the unnamed highest-paid director taking home £324,000. “The brand itself has also been struggling for some time,” said Roger Hutton, an insolvency expert and partner at the law firm Clarion. “The last time Typhoo Tea made a pre-tax profit was the £220,000 it posted in the year to 31 March 2017. Since then, the company has made over £100m in pre-tax losses. “While the court filing doesn’t mean the company is officially in administration yet, time is of the essence to help secure the future of the company and the earlier interventions are taken, the more solutions there are.”"

          "headline": "August: Osage County review – Pamela Rabe leads stellar cast in an American tragicomedy",
          "bodyText": "In the wake of the US election, two Pulitzer prize-winning American plays have opened simultaneously on Gadigal Country in Sydney this week: at Belvoir, Tracy Letts’ 2007 drama August: Osage County; and at Sydney Theatre Company, Lynn Nottage’s 2015 tale of fractured friendship, Sweat. Both centre on women, and both explore the legacies of economic impoverishment. Both have America on their mind. That’s about where the similarities end. It’s easy to see why Sweat was programmed for this moment: a play that debuted on the eve of Donald Trump’s first term, set among disenfranchised steelworkers in Pennsylvania – a crucial battleground in recent US elections – and exploring the vexed intersection of class and race. Letts’ play is a less obvious choice: a white middle class “family gathering” drama, written in the second term of the Bush administration. Yes it’s a cracker of a play: a black comedy of family dysfunction, perennially relatable – and performed here by a stellar cast led by Pamela Rabe. But of all the American plays you could program in the immediate aftermath of this particular election, it feels like an outlier – perhaps more so to audiences who saw the ultra-naturalistic, Tony award-winning Steppenwolf production that toured to Sydney in 2010. This feels like old-school American drama, in an era that arguably calls for fresh voices and perspectives. The setting is Osage County, Oklahoma: the Plains country immortalised in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, and a state that has voted Republican for the last 56 years. In the high heat of summer, three generations of the Weston family have gathered in the decrepit family home presided over by poison-tongued, pill-popping matriarch Violet (Rabe). The family’s patriarch, retired poet and full-time alcoholic Beverly (John Howard), has gone missing. Drawn into this pressure cooker are Ivy (Amy Mathews), the dutiful but weary middle child, who lives near home; Violet’s sister Mattie Fae (Helen Thomson), Mattie Fae’s husband, Charlie (Greg Stone), and their lacklustre adult son, “Little” Charles (Will O’Mahony). There is the eldest daughter, Barbara (Tamsin Carroll), an academic, who flies in from Colorado with her husband, Bill (Bert LaBonté), and teen daughter, Jean (Esther Williams). The youngest daughter, Karen (Anna Samson), turns up with her fiance, Steve (Rohan Nichol), a slick operator involved in Middle East-related “security work”. And then there is Johnna (Bee Cruse), a young Cheyenne woman who Beverly hired to look after the housework, shortly before his disappearance. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As in all family gathering plays, tensions bubble over, grenades are lobbed and secrets are revealed. Letts, an actor and writer born and raised in Oklahoma, drew on his own torturous family history for this play and the resulting dialogue and depiction of conflict is painfully – and occasionally hilariously – spot on, even when the story veers into melodrama. The Belvoir cast perform it beautifully and the audience eat it up, wincing, laughing and gasping at key revelations. Letts’ play posits this conflict as the product of a kind of “Midwestern sensibility” born out of the multigenerational trauma of European immigrants and their descendants scrabbling to survive on the unforgiving Plains – land that settlers ironically made less habitable by their efforts. But it has bigger things on its mind too, positioning the Westons as a kind of microcosm of the American promise gone to seed, lost in a haze of drugs, alcohol and delusion. The worst of America is seen in closeup: racism, misogyny, rampant individualism, and a wilful refusal to deal with its foundational sin – genocide. Belvoir’s production, helmed by artistic director Eamon Flack, dials this commentary up, pushing back on the play’s naturalism and making something more nightmarish. Instead of the realistic three-storey house specified in Letts’ script, set designer Bob Cousins has created a kind of deconstructed prairie house, whose jumble of familiar elements visualises dysfunction and delusion. Whereas Letts’ stage directions delineated scenes between different rooms of the house, this production occasionally throws adjacent scenes into the same space simultaneously – sometimes to confusing effect, particularly in the first act as various family members arrive. The sense of disorientation is compounded by this production’s decision to keep Beverly on stage for the first act, even after he has disappeared from the action – a kind of unmoored spirit. Johnna, too, remains on stage – throughout, as Letts apparently intended she should. Her often silent presence can be read in different ways, but inevitably calls to mind the trope of the “stoic native” who absorbs the bad behaviour of the settlers while given little backstory or agency. Letts, who has said his treatment of the character is informed by his own Native American ancestry, even throws in one very literal reference, via Violet, to Johnna as the “Indian in the attic”. Still, it’s a fine line between replicating a trope and subverting it. Flack and his team lean into this dilemma, emphasising Johnna’s presence in subtle ways, and adjusting the ending to give her more obvious power. Still, there’s a sense that the play itself is not handling this crucial aspect of the American dysfunction as well as it could – a problem that no production can quite overcome. August: Osage County is on at Sydney’s Belvoir Theatre until 15 December, then Perth’s Heath Ledger Theatre as part of Perth festival from 27 February to 16 March"

          "bodyText": "For some of us, being without our smartphones for a few hours prompts panic: think of all the messages we would miss. For others, however, going off-grid sounds like bliss. Now, those looking to escape the doomscrolling can go cold turkey – for a few hours, at least. The Offline Club, which has made a name for itself by hosting phone-free hangouts in the Netherlands, has brought its concept to London. On Wednesday, the Guardian visited one of the company’s no-phone zones, hosted in a church in West Hampstead. Attenders were greeted with a grand, Instagrammable display of dangling fairy lights and statues of saints backlit by neon signs. Those hoping to capture the scene on their phone cameras had to be quick, however, as devices were locked away shortly after arrival. Some of those who came wanted to unwind alone and meditate or read without peeking at their phones. For others, the event meant something deeper: a chance to make meaningful connections in a world where opportunities to do so are increasingly fleeting. “When I walked in I was nervous,” said Jayren Malijan, 20. The fledgling perfumer, who recommends scents on “fragrancetok”, came to the event alone. “I came to make new friends. People complain that they’re lonely but they’re not willing to go out and make an effort to not feel lonely.” He said a reliance on phones was creating “a lot of introverts”, especially among the younger generation. “Phones are physiologically impactful. It’s detrimental to your mental health. People can’t hold a conversation,” he said. “On the street, everyone looks so serious and unapproachable looking down at their screens. An event like this is what most of us need, especially if you’re young.” Malijan said he yearned for years past when being offline was the norm. “Technology wasn’t advanced [back then]. People would play out with neighbours, now everyone is playing PlayStation. There’s no physical interaction any more. It’s broken the light of people.” Most of those in attendance were young people who have witnessed mobile phones transform from bricks to slick devices that can waste the day away, though the technology’s allure has reeled in those of all ages. “I spend about 10 hours a day looking at screens,” said Elizabeth, 50, who works in finance. “I wake up and look at screens. I work at home and have two monitors. Throughout the day I’m constantly on the screens.” She said she remembered when simple tasks that can now be carried out with a few swipes had to be done in person. “You used to walk to the bank or the doctors to speak to someone. Now it’s all online. They basically tell you: ‘Bugger off, just go online and fill out the form. It’s so convenient, so nice and easy’. They really push it on you. “I see the benefit of it, it’s supposed to save you time. You won’t be queueing in the bank for hours to see your statement, but now you end up spending more time on gadgets.” Elizabeth said she worried about the impact modern technology was having on younger people. “Individual loneliness has gotten a lot worse. We used to socialise much more, we used to have parties. When I was a kid, we would knock on our neighbour’s door and say: ‘Is such and such coming out to play?’ Kids are not doing that, my son is not doing that.” While children today might prefer their PlayStation over the playground, there were roars of excitement among the adult attenders when the event’s host, Ben, announced at the halfway point that a soft-play area would open. They got up on their feet to mingle. Taz Alam, 31, a YouTuber, was among those up and about. “Everyone here is so lovely,” she said. “You can just go up to someone who you don’t know and start a conversation. If you did that anywhere else in London, out of this bubble, people would be like: ‘You’re weird’. “It just feels so easy and natural. They create such a safe space in what can be a lonely place.” As a YouTuber, Alam inevitably has to look at screens and stay online to keep up with the latest trends. “The irony is that I found out about this event on TikTok.” She said she thought social media could be a positive thing if used consciously. “I’m never going to say social media is bad because I owe it everything. It’s how I met so many cool people. It’s how I have my job and pay my bills. “I think social media is great. It’s just your relationship with it. If you’re using it to numb your brain because you don’t like your reality, that’s not healthy.” Alam said she clocked up about 10 hours of screen time a day. “If I’m having a good day, like this, where my dopamine is happening and it’s coming from genuine engagement, I probably won’t need to get that hit from my phone.” As the end of the session approached, she spoke for many in the room when asked if she was itching to get her phone back: “Not at all.”"

          "bodyText": "When we walked into school on the morning of 6 November, we exchanged quick glances with the other girls in our social circle – looks filled with uncertainty and dread about the future. Because we are applying to colleges all around the country and about to leave our homes in the Hudson Valley, political issues suddenly have begun to feel a lot more personal. Access to abortion and contraception, protection of the environment, and the growing hate and violence toward marginalized groups all have the potential to greatly impact our lives. We had only brief conversations about why Trump’s victory felt so defeating, but our shared disappointment stuck with us as we walked to our first period classes. But as we sat down at our desks, we noticed a very different attitude among our male peers. Subtle high-fives were exchanged and remarks about the impending success of the next four years were whispered around. It didn’t make much sense. We live in a mostly liberal town in the Hudson Valley where Harris-Walz signs were posted outside of most of our friends’ houses. This is not to say that families with dissenting opinions don’t live in our town. But the boys that were the most vocal in their enthusiasm about the election results have progressive parents just like ours. As these startling observations made us look back on the last couple of years, we started to realize that maybe this wasn’t as unexpected as we thought. An increased interest in pursuing the ideal masculine appearance by going to the gym and the creation of new male-dominated social activities like the infamous exclusive poker nights had seemed innocent and had been easy to write off as typical boyhood behavior. But now all that seemed as if it was just the beginning of a new wave of male conservatism that was infiltrating our school. Obsession with achieving a more muscular body through excessive exercise and intense dieting fueled by ridiculous social media campaigns fell far outside the realm of healthy self-care. And the desire to socialize only with other boys stood in stark contrast to the co-ed activities we were accustomed to since childhood. It hadn’t taken long for this focus on machismo to creep into these boys’ mindsets and conversations. Seemingly harmless disrespectful comments with witty undertones toward girls became commonplace, and feelings of traditional male dominance started to sneak back into our friend groups. Upon reflection, we both recall speaking about stereotypically masculine interests or topics and then hearing snickering exchanges between the boys in the room followed by targeted belittling retorts disguised as trivial jokes. It genuinely felt as though they viewed us as unintelligent or even inferior. During science lab our male lab partners read the directions aloud to us, and we had to remind them that we could actually read. What we saw now was that all this was the result of an obsession – perhaps somewhat subconscious – with preserving an idea of traditional masculinity that both Biden and Harris threatened, in different ways. As an older, frail individual, Biden was an easy target for Trump’s aggression. While Trump’s comments seemed like an attack on Biden’s age and mental competence, they also incorporated indirect attacks on his masculinity that influenced this impressionable demographic of young men. And when contrasted with Trump’s pumping fist after the assassination attempt in July, Biden was appearing weaker and weaker while Trump was solidifying his representation of traditional male heroism. Similarly, when Kamala Harris replaced Biden as Trump’s opponent, his goal of making his adversary seem “weak” was much more straightforward, exacerbated further by Harris’s prioritization of women’s rights in her campaign. Still, because our town is considered such a progressive bubble, we never thought the tone of the election was connected to the changes we were observing in our male peers. But Trump’s calculated direct focus on young boys was strong enough to win them over. While these are just observations within our own high school, we believe that this is happening across the country. Young, well-off white boys from liberal families are being tempted by conservatism simply to protect an archaic idea of masculinity that guarantees them inherent power. It is not as if they are against abortion, or care much about the economy or immigration, or even feel remotely attracted to the rest of conservative dogma. But clearly, a shift back toward traditional gender roles is resonating with them now as progression toward female empowerment threatens their already delicate self esteem. So how do we address this, going forward? How do we ensure that young boys practice critical thinking instead of falling victim to Trump’s rhetoric with its focus on recommitting to gender stereotypes that we believed had finally been eradicated? Parents, we urge you to be aware of this growing phenomenon and teach your children about the dangers of calculated political movements designed to further one politician’s agenda. Until we do so, it is likely this pattern will continue. Boys in our school as young as eight are beginning to exhibit these same misogynistic tendencies that we never remember noticing when we were their age. And the most dangerous aspect of this is how little it’s talked about in mainstream media and how easily it has been overlooked in progressive communities. In fact this is an epidemic that will continue to spread rapidly until we start talking about it. So look closely because these boys will be among the voters responsible for deciding our future elections."

          "headline": "UK flying taxi firm pins hopes on investors as cash runs short",
          "bodyText": "On a dreary November day in the Cotswolds, England, the VX4 – a cross between a plane and a helicopter – rose from an airport runway, hovered a few feet off the ground and set back down. It might not have reached a heady altitude, but for its British owner, Vertical Aerospace, it was a crucial moment. The company, which has received millions of pounds in UK taxpayer support, is running short of cash. Amid crunch talks with investors that could lead to the founder, Stephen Fitzpatrick, losing control of the business to a US hedge fund, the flight offered evidence that the electric craft could carry a person without needing a tether to the ground for safety. Vertical has already experienced what can happen if things go wrong. On a sunnier day last August, an unmanned version of the aircraft crashed into the runway after glue holding a blade on one of the eight rotors failed. The 3.7-tonne aircraft, plunged 30ft into a crumpled heap, with the blade landing 50 metres away. Nobody was injured. The crash and the cash crunch have underlined the difficulty of making flying taxis a reality after nearly a century of efforts. Vertical announced on Tuesday that it would delay the date its first aircraft would win UK regulatory approval to fly passengers by two more years, to 2028. It had initially claimed the aircraft – with room for four passengers, 100 miles of range and top speeds of 150mph – would be in service by 2025. Stuart Simpson, Vertical’s chief executive, confirmed to investors this week that it has chosen the UK for a factory to build 200 aircraft a year. However, cautious regulators and suppliers put paid to the ambitious timeline. A host of startups are trying to build flying taxis, known in the industry as electric vertical takeoff and landing (Evtol) aircraft. For a few years, they appeared to be making rapid progress as investors, fuelled by cheap money, sought out the Tesla of the air. Flying taxi companies such as the US’s Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation as well as Germany’s Volocopter raised significant sums and built flying prototypes. The three biggest plane makers – Europe’s Airbus, the US’s Boeing and Brazil’s Embraer – have been drawn into the race via subsidiaries. Vertical took advantage of that wave. Fitzpatrick, an entrepreneur whose investments have included a Formula One team and who derives most of his £800m fortune from his energy company Ovo, founded Vertical in 2016. It floated in 2021 on the US stock market with a valuation of $2.2bn. However, rising interest rates and development delays have given investors pause before pouring in more money. Vertical’s share price has plunged 95% since the Covid pandemic bubble, valuing it at only $110m. A US-listed rival, Lilium, last month filed for bankruptcy for its German subsidiaries and is seeking a buyer to save it. The Chinese carmaker Geely was in talks to save Volocopter, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, after its value also slumped. Britain’s Rolls-Royce has ended plans for a flying taxis business nearly three years after its aircraft broke the air speed record. “There was a massive bubble,” said an industry source. “It’s starting to get to the pointy end.” Long term, concerns remain over how flying taxis would be regulated in busy skies. But the industry received positive news as US officials issued rules on how such vehicles could be operated and pilots trained. Simpson told investors the company needed about $100m to cover its costs for the next year. It had £42.8m in cash at the end of September. The immediate cash crisis could be eased if talks succeed with a big lender. Fitzpatrick and Vertical have been in discussions for nearly a year with Jason Mudrick, an American distressed-debt investor who made millions during the pandemic investing in “meme stocks” such as AMC Entertainment and GameStop. Mudrick has offered to convert about half of his $200m in past loans to Vertical into equity, in exchange for a cash injection of up to $50m. However, he wrote in a letter to Vertical’s board last month that he had been “denied at every turn by Mr Fitzpatrick as he refuses to accept the contractual dilution to his holdings” of about 70% of the company. Existing shareholders would be left with only 20% of the company in the deal, although Fitzpatrick has been pushing for 30%. A deal could open the way to other investors making new equity investments. Candidates could include previous investors such as Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines, as well as Microsoft and the control systems supplier Honeywell. While Vertical boasts of a low-cost model of buying technology off the shelf from established suppliers, it is likely to need between $500m and $1bn to get through four years without revenues. Simpson said he was “optimistic” about finding capital, despite investors expressing concerns about the delayed launch. But a further $500m investment in Joby last month by Toyota and $300m raised by Beta Technologies has reassured some investors that flying taxi companies can still find money – if they can prove the technology works. “This is a difficult funding environment, and there has been a shakeout in the industry,” Simpson said. “I think we’re going to be one of the winners.”"

          "bodyText": "As a college freshman in the autumn of 2015, Kathlina was excited about what lay ahead. “I was studying political science and Spanish in Jacksonville, Florida, and I was having a great time meeting people,” she says. She soon struck up a friendship with a man in one of her classes and began joining him and his friends at campus events. “I was dating my childhood sweetheart from home, so I definitely wasn’t looking for a relationship, but I was keen to meet new people,” she says. One day, she was invited to her new friend’s apartment, where she met his girlfriend, Adriana. “She was in her third year studying psychology and I thought she was a bit intimidating because she was a senior,” says Kathlina. Adriana admits she was “frosty” at first. “Kathlina was so pretty and smart; I felt a bit threatened,” she says. “I wasn’t a very secure person at the time.” Kathlina and Adriana crossed paths at a few more college events, but Adriana says she continued to give Kathlina the cold shoulder. “Eventually I started feeling guilty, so I asked my boyfriend for her number so I could apologise,” she says. They went out for bubble tea together and “really hit it off”. “She was so nice and I realised I’d misjudged her,” says Adriana. “Based on my behaviour, I would have understood if she didn’t want to hang out, but I could really see myself being friends with her if she was open to it.” Kathlina was “super-excited” to be getting to know Adriana better: “Our conversation just flowed. We talked for hours about everything from food to politics to Beyoncé.” From then on, they began attending campus events together more regularly and meeting up for lunch when they could. “She took me to my first nightclub,” says Kathlina. “I thought it was the coolest thing ever.” At the end of the academic year, Adriana broke up with her boyfriend and Kathlina supported her. “She was there through the thick of it. Whenever I needed to talk, she made time to speak to me and I knew she always had my back,” says Adriana. After graduating, Adriana stayed in Jacksonville to work as a resident assistant at a women’s shelter for two years, before moving to Gainesville to complete a master’s in environmental and public health. They remained close friends and spoke on the phone all the time. In 2020, Kathlina moved to Austin, Texas, to study environmental global policy. A year later, Adriana decided to move there, too: “I really wanted a change and had always enjoyed my trips to Austin. Plus, my best friend was there.” Kathlina says it was “phenomenal” to be living in the same city as her friend again: “It was like a missing piece falling into place. I love living here, but it’s been so much more fun having her to do things with.” As well as regular baking nights, thrift shopping trips, movies and eating out, they have also explored different parts of Texas together. Next year, it will be the pair’s 10-year “friendship anniversary”. They are planning a hiking trip to Connecticut and Vermont to celebrate. “We decided to do something special,” says Kathlina. “We both love autumn and we want to see the leaves change colour, as it’s not something you really get to experience in Texas.” Both women say they have been a support to each other. “My first year of grad school was remote, due to the pandemic, which was especially tough, but she helped me through,” Kathlina says. Adriana also helped her to plan her wedding to her childhood sweetheart, which was initially called off due to Covid. “She helped me plan it twice. She was there through all of it.” Kathlina has been Adriana’s “confidante” in relationships. “When I met my partner, she was the first person I told that I liked him,” she says. “I know she’ll always be honest with me.” She loves her friend’s strength and the fact that she is always unapologetically herself. “It’s the longest friendship I’ve had in my life and having a constant like that is so special. I think of her as another sister.” Adriana appreciates Kathlina’s resilience and confidence. “She’ll always put herself out there. If I find some spur-of-the-moment activity like bouldering, a drag pageant or a protest, she’s always the first onboard,” she says. “I love knowing that she’s always going to be there for me.”"

          "headline": "First Thing: Trump picks Elon Musk to lead government efficiency department",
          "bodyText": "Good morning. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Donald Trump has announced, along with the former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The new body will not be a government agency but an outside organization offering the White House “advice and guidance”. Trump said it would shock government systems, as Doge (the acronym is the name of Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, which itself references a meme about a dog with an amusing expression), partners with the Office of Management and Budget to “create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before”. Musk has admitted that slashing spending “necessarily involves some temporary hardship” for American taxpayers. Musk, who owns X, promised to publish the department’s actions online for “maximum transparency”, saying he would keep “a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars”. Ramaswamy, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur who, like Musk, has no government experience, also responded to his appointment on X, saying: “We will not go gently, @elonmusk”. How much will they be cutting? Musk last month gave a goal of slashing government spending by $2tn, roughly a third of total spending, which experts say could result in deregulation that would directly affect Musk’s companies. Biden administration will not limit arms transfers to Israel The Biden administration has said that it will not curb its supply of arms to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if conditions in Gaza did not improve, despite humanitarian groups saying Israel has met almost none of the US demands. The US said on Tuesday that Israel had made some good, but limited, progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. But aid groups said conditions were worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, despite the 30-day US ultimatum on 13 October that threatening sanctions. The state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said progress must continue but that “we, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of US law”. He denied “giving Israel a pass” and said Israel must take further steps. How many of the ultimatum demands did Israel meet? A report by aid groups listed 19 measures of compliance with the US demands, finding Israel failed to meet 15 and partially complied with only four. Trump names Huckabee as Israel envoy and Fox News host as defense secretary Trump has picked the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel, and a Fox News host with no government experience for defense secretary. Huckabee has a history of hardline pro-Israel rhetoric and previously stated Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which is dotted with Israeli settlements that are not recognised under international law. He denies that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation. Trump also announced he was appointing a Fox News host and army veteran, Pete Hegseth, who has no experience in government, as defense secretary, stunning the Pentagon and the broader defense world. Hegseth is strongly opposed to army programs that promote equity and inclusion, has questioned the role of women in combat, and called for service members charged with war crimes to be pardoned. What does Huckabee’s appointment signal? It looks like a return to the explicitly pro-Israel attitude of Trump’s first administration, when Trump moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In other news … The jazz drummer Roy Haynes, whose career spanned nine decades, has died aged 99. Florida’s department of education has published a list of more than 700 books pulled from schools by a law that allows parents to challenge the content of library books. China is in mourning after a man drove his car into a sports centre in Zhuhai on Monday, killing 35 people and severely injuring 43 others. Stat of the day: Number of business lobbyists attending the UN biodiversity summit doubled this year Lobbyists for industries including meat, oil, and pesticides turned out in droves for the UN’s latest biodiversity talks. A record 1,261 delegates registered for Cop16 in Cali, Colombia, which ended without significant wins on issues including nature funding, compared with 613 in 2022. Some have questioned whether the presence of lobbyists influenced the outcomes of this year’s negotiations. Don’t miss this: Mormons react to Hugh Grant horror Heretic Heretic, a thriller about a psychopath toying with young Mormon missionaries, has prompted conversations in Latter Day-Saints’ communities, with viewing parties hosted by former Mormons as well as those still in the church. The movie was condemned by the Mormon church, but for others it struck a chord, with one saying: “You’re sending 18-year-olds out into the world who have grown up in a bubble.” Climate check: ‘No sign’ of promised fossil fuel transition as emissions hit new high For the world to stand a chance at meeting the 1.5C temperature target, emissions must fall by 43% by 2030. But despite the pledges countries made at last year’s Cop summit to transition away from fossil fuels, there is “no sign” that is happening, with new data showing emissions from coal, oil and gas will rise by 0.8% in 2024.

          "bodyText": "What is the one true religion? That is one of several leading questions posed by Hugh Grant’s professorial villain Mr Reed in the hit new film Heretic, which twists examinations of faith into viciously entertaining psychological horror. Mr Reed’s targets are, at least externally, representatives of religious certainty: two sister missionaries from the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who knock on his door with hopes to convert him. Sister Barnes (Yellowjackets’ Sophie Thatcher), a convert from Philadelphia, is quieter, more droll and naturally skeptical. Sister Paxton (Chloe East), raised Mormon in Utah, is more stereotypically chipper, polite and credulous. Both believe Mr Reed – at least enough to step inside and escape a downpour – when he says that his wife is baking pie in the other room and will join them shortly; sister missionaries are not allowed to be alone with a man unless another woman is present. Initially, Mr Reed seems enthusiastic and curious about their faith; he even has a dog-eared copy of the Book of Mormon. But the conversation rapidly darkens, as Mr Reed devilishly pokes holes in Mormon doctrine and history, as well as most other organized religions, as a means of psychological destabilization, control, fear and eventually violence – Heretic is, after all, a horror film, written and directed by A Quiet Place film-makers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. The characters’ Mormonism serves as an entryway into a psychological thriller of belief, as poked and prodded by a madman with the demeanor of a demented religious studies scholar (and played against type with relish by a never-better Grant). The film has, unsurprisingly, drawn the ire of the Mormon church, which said in an official statement that it “promotes violence against women because of their faith” and “undermines the contributions of volunteers” that “runs counter to the safety and wellbeing of our communities”. The church-owned Deseret News reviewed the film as “dismissive of what believers find sacred”. But for those raised in the Mormon church, a modern American religion often subjected to outside fascination via true crime series, influencer-driven reality shows or satirical caricatures, the prospect of two sister missionaries finding themselves trapped in a dangerous situation, and the metaphor of doubt as a terrifying, infernal descent, felt all too real. The portrayal of Mormon missionaries was “one of the best I’ve seen”, said Lexi Seals-Johnson, who grew up in the church and went on to establish Lost &amp; Found Club, a group for the female and genderqueer ex-religious community in Salt Lake City, which hosted its own Heretic screening. “I know many woman who served missions, my wife included, could not even watch the trailer because of how eerily similar the first scenes were.” While some phrasing “may have been a bit off”, said Nicole Merritts of Salt Lake City, “the naivety of their young age, attempts to stay positive, and the mix of optimistic and weary personalities was a fairly accurate characterization.” For Whitney Rose, a star of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City – which, along with The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, serves as a primary locus for Utah fascination in pop culture – Heretic “depicted exactly what I know missions to be”. Rose, a member of a founding Mormon family who left the church, hosted a joint screening in Salt Lake with Whitney Leavitt, of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, who is still faithful, playing on Mr Reed’s binary of Belief/Disbelief and prompting discussions of integrating doubt into one’s practice of faith. To Rose, Barnes and Paxton’s naivete, politeness and vulnerability felt spot-on. “You’re sending 18-year-olds out into the world who have grown up in a bubble and shelter of Mormonism,” she said. “You grow up thinking one way your entire life, and at 18, all of a sudden you’re supposed to go out and figure out how to be safe and invite people into a religion.” Rose is one of many formerly devout Mormons to react strongly to the movie, from Reddit threads delving into issues of faith and missionary safety to TikToks expressing shock at the accuracy of small details – East’s Utah accent, the way Barnes frames her status as a convert (“Such a typical Utah Mormon response,” said Merritts), the way Barnes and Paxton tiptoe around their curiosity of sex in the opening scene, with Barnes framing her own brush with pornography as a lesson from God. “That’s such a missionary thing to do,” said Caroline Brammer, who was raised Mormon and saw the film in Austin, Texas. In one of his many belabored speeches deconstructing religion, Mr Reed quotes Gordon B Hinckley, who served as president of the church from 1995 until 2008. “When I hear about Mormons in pop culture, they usually take jabs at Joseph Smith or Brigham Young, who were early prophets and easy to criticize,” said Brammer. “But I don’t know if I’ve ever heard someone talk about Gordon B Hinckley, who was the prophet of my childhood.” The quote was so specific – “I don’t even know how you would go looking for that,” she said – that it prompted her to Google if the film-makers were Mormon. Beck and Woods are not; they first developed the idea for the film while working in Salt Lake and befriending many Mormon and ex-Mormon families. For research, they read not only the Book of Mormon but the Quran, various atheist thinkers and Nick Bostrom’s simulation argument, among other texts. They consulted numerous Mormon friends on the script, along with “a consistent gut check of like, are we approaching things with empathy?” said Beck. “Are we actually embodying what our knowledge of Mormon missionaries are actually like? Are we making sure that they don’t feel like caricatures? Are they authentic people? Which is always the goal when you write a script, but it felt like there was a little more responsibility to this.” Aspects of the dialogue, such as the sister missionaries admitting to each other that some of the songs in the Book of Mormon were funny, were drawn from real conversations. “We’re taking a lot of the truth of what we knew from our friends and putting it in the mouths of these two missionaries, because we feel like the portrayal of the LDS community, and in particular missionaries, are always caricatures,” said Woods. It also helps that both East and Thatcher were raised Mormon, which informed the idiosyncrasies of their performances. Brammer compared the film favorably to the Hulu series Under the Banner of Heaven, a prestige TV adaptation of a book about murders by violent Mormon fundamentalists, which “sounded very clunky” like “they never actually talked to someone who was Mormon”. Heretic is “more focused on the reality that missionaries are just 19-, 20-year-old kids, and not all of them are as like righteous as you’d imagine. A lot of them are questioning things, and going on missions for different reasons,” she said. And they’re kids – “they talk about stupid stuff like porn or sex”. And in some cases, move away from the church; several ex-Mormon viewers noted that the terror of the film’s latter half (no spoilers!) offered a metaphor for the bewildering deconstruction of belief system. “I appreciated that both subtle LDS nuances and a spectrum of beliefs were represented,” said Mae Warner, of Salt Lake City. “In my own life, deconstructing religious beliefs felt violating and not fully consensual. Heretic captures that experience both explicitly and metaphorically in such poignant ways.” The film was “a fairly provocative portrayal of faith in general”, said Seals-Johnson. “It’s always jarring to hear details of the Mormon church discussed in mainstream media because so much of it is hush-hush.” For Rose, though aspects of the film “validated my faith of knowing that we’re held accountable for how we treat each other”, the psychological resonated with her departure from the church. “I feel like that was me,” she said. “Obviously on a completely different journey, but the mental turmoil and the torment and the struggle that I went through in my 20s of leaving the church, when I had my faith crisis – that’s what it feels like. It does feel that traumatic.” Rose, like the others I spoke to, did not expect the truly devout to watch the film, given the church’s public disapproval. “It would be probably considered not the right thing to do,” she said. But she wishes anyone of any faith would see it, “for their own faith, and just for more understanding of why people leave”. Heretic is out in cinemas now"

          "headline": "‘Almost like imprisonment’: the shocking truth about life for boybands in their ‘golden era’",
          "bodyText": "‘People often don’t get it,” says Ritchie Neville. “They think being in a famous band is a dream. But I’ve had situations where I’m out with friends and, when I start talking, jaws drop to the floor. They’re like, ‘Oh my god, is that really what it was like?’” Neville was a member of mega boyband 5ive. Formed in 1997, the five-piece were famous for singles such as Got the Feelin’, When the Lights Go Out and Slam Dunk (Da Funk). And Neville is one of many former boybanders taking part in a new documentary series about the era when ab flashes, knee slides and vocal harmonies ruled. Boybands Forever, made by Louis Theroux’s production company Mindhouse, is a three-parter about the golden era of the manufactured group, taking us from Take That through to East 17, Boyzone, 911, Damage, Westlife and 5ive, all the way to Blue. Using archive footage of auditions, TV appearances and screaming fans, as well as interviews with everyone from Robbie Williams and Brian McFadden to Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh, it’s both a total nostalgia-fest, full of juicy titbits from the era (did you know 5ive turned down Baby One More Time?) and a shocking indictment of the impact of fame on young stars. “What surprised me,” says Nancy Strang, the director of the documentary and Theroux’s wife, “was just how hard they worked. It’s the era before social media, when you had to be everywhere. You had to physically go places to be seen, or you had to physically go to an interview. It was 24/7 and relentless.” This was certainly true for Neville. He was just 17 when he was picked by Spice Girls creator Chris Herbert to be in 5ive, via auditions advertised in The Stage (Russell Brand also showed up). Styled as New Kids on the Block-lite, and signed to BMG, they were positioned as pop’s bad boys, with a reputation for being unruly. “The amount of times,” says Neville, “I’ve sat down with a journalist and they’ve asked, ‘Tell us the most messed-up drinking story you had.’” And there were a few. There was the time at Rock in Rio in Brazil where they “got absolutely smashed with Liam Gallagher”. Another time, he says, “we got Westlife absolutely mashed, to the point that we were in a hotel room and they were, like, running and diving at the wall. We were supposed to be the bad boys but we were like, ‘Oh no, what are they are doing?’ Don’t believe the good guy exterior!” But while the band did get to do “some fantastic things” which Neville is grateful for, life in the group wasn’t as fun as often made out. Famous within months of forming, they found this almost-instant fan reaction overwhelming. Footage in the documentary shows fans grabbing at the bandmates as they run from hotel to car. Neville remembers the first time fans gathered around the tour bus: “It was insane. There were 100-plus people surrounding the bus, banging on the thing. And there is no off switch.” Some fans took things even further. He remembers one time, when he was 17 or 18, when a woman who looked like she was in her late 30s asked him for a picture. “While we were doing the picture, she just grabbed me down there like it was perfectly normal. I was like, ‘What are you doing?’” It became one of numerous occasions he was groped, he says, sometimes while performing. “The thing is, a lot of guys would be like, ‘What I wouldn’t give for that!’ But it’s not always pleasant, if you don’t ask for it. It’s like, ‘Why are you doing that? Please don’t do it again.’” It wasn’t just fans, says Neville, who took advantage. He believes the band were exploited by those profiting from their success. Their schedule was relentless. They had just “two days off in two years” while starting out. And he says they were paid just £100 each a week to begin with, even after hit singles like Everybody Get Up had been released. Neville’s lowest moment came while the band were touring Australia and New Zealand. He contracted chickenpox and was seriously unwell. Advised by a doctor to go home and rest at his parents for two weeks, he says he was then told by a label representative: “Doctors over-exaggerate, don’t they?” “In the end,” he says, “they wouldn’t give me my passport to fly home.” Fellow band member Scott Robinson decided to help out. “Scott had to go in and nick my passport and just hand it to me and bundle me in a taxi at four in the morning. At the time, I didn’t think that much of it. Now, that’s an encroachment of power, isn’t it really? It’s almost imprisonment.” Lee Brennan, a member of earlier group 911, sees his time in the boyband bubble slightly differently. Formed in Glasgow in 1995, the trio – known for the body-pumping dance moves developed by members Jimmy Constable and Simon “Spike” Dawbarn during their time as dancers on The Hitman and Her – released singles including A Night to Remember. It was, says Brennan, a tough workload – “a whirlwind of planes, hotels, gigs, press conferences” – that meant he didn’t have time to stop and enjoy the good times. “We were so tired and we didn’t have a minute to think.” He doesn’t feel like it was the label exploiting him and bandmates, though. They were all just driven to become successful. And they were – selling 10m singles worldwide. In the band’s heyday, Brennan’s lifestyle was one of first-class travel and shopping sprees. “I didn’t even check with my bank,” says Brennan. “I had a gold card. I’d go to Bond Street and spend a fortune on Gucci, Prada and Armani. I’d wear them a couple of times, then I’d be like, ‘Well, I can’t be seen out in that again.’ So I used to put them in black bin liners, or give them away to the cleaners.” But being hounded by fans every day became hard to handle. Brennan remembers arriving at the BBC to do interviews and getting swarmed by fans in their thousands. “If anyone got a chance to rip a necklace off you, or a hat, it would be gone.” Naturally shy, he didn’t like getting recognised, especially when he got negative comments. “It was a weird thing to get my head around. It really messed with the way I saw myself.” By 1999, he’d had enough. “I said to my management team, ‘I’m losing the plot. I’m losing all recognition of who I am.’ There was nothing done about that.” He thinks the band could have benefited from more support. “We should have had more care, mental health-wise. Counsellors who could have been on the road and asked, ‘How are you feeling? Are you missing things? Is it affecting you? Is the schedule too much? Are you sleeping?’” Director Strang doesn’t want the documentary to place blame on anyone in particular for what the boybands went through in the 1990s and 2000s. She stresses that many of the managers were as young as the performers themselves – and that the documentary is a celebration of their creativity as much as an exposé of that era. Plus the media were just as exploitative. “You see women on TV asking inappropriate questions of teenage boys,” Strang says of the archive footage. “You can’t believe it’s only 30 years ago.” 911 broke up in 2000 and 5ive broke up in 2001, but both have re-formed in recent years, with Neville and Brennan now enjoying doing things on their own terms. They hope their appearances in the documentary will push the industry forward when it comes to mental health care, or even just time off. “That level of fame, it can do so many good things for you, but can be really negative,” says Brennan. They both support the Liam’s Law petition, a plea to safeguard young stars’ mental health that was started after former One Direction member Liam Payne fell to his death in Buenos Aires last month, with multiple drugs in his system. “I could not support that more,” says Neville. “You have an affinity with people in bands. When One Direction took off, you couldn’t help looking at them in the press and thinking, ‘How are they doing?’” He wants young people to have somebody independent they could call. “Someone they know who isn’t going to go back to the label, to other people maybe in the band. They have no vested interest in your success. They’re only there for your wellbeing.” Brennan agrees: “I think the law change should have been done years ago. I hope this series will make things snowball, and people take notice. Record labels make a lot of money. It won’t cost them that much to get somebody on the road to look after their product.” Boybands Forever begins on BBC Two on 16 November"

          "bodyText": "I might be exaggerating, but to nine-year-old me it felt like 5,000 fishes. In 1982, there was a BBC1 TV show called Pebble Mill at One, which featured Glynn Christian as its pioneering TV chef, who I think paved the way for the likes of Keith Floyd and all the celebrity chefs who followed. Glynn used to cook privately for my parents’ business partners, and through this connection my brother Al got his 15 minutes of fame at the age of 13. I don’t remember the whys and wherefores; I just knew that he was going to cook on the television! I don’t know if there was a brief, but my pa decided that Al should cook a fish dish: namely golden pan-fried fish with ginger and spring onions. The Chinese characters for this dish translate literally as “fried, sealed fish”, which loses all of its poetry, but what it lacks in translation, it makes up for in flavour. My father is not a soft taskmaster, so for weeks running up to the event, he must have made Al cook this dish every night, sometimes even twice a night, until he was satisfied that he had perfected the technique. He would stand behind Al, watching critically over his shoulder. The ginger was too fine, then not fine enough. The spring onions were cut unevenly. The fish was cooked, but not golden – the heat was too low; the fish was golden but not cooked – the heat was too high. I remember the focus, the concentration, the single-mindedness of those cooking sessions, and it felt as if we were having to eat 5,000 fishes in a month. I usually steam my fish, but I recently decided to replicate that same dish at home. This method of cooking produces food that evokes an oral sensation that the Chinese call “mouth fragrant” – that is, literally something that smells good in your mouth. Fish with a slightly firmer flesh produces the best results, because it can withstand all the swirling around in the pan; thanks to its meatier texture, my kids call this “chicken fish”. I don’t have to focus or concentrate in the same way as my brother did, partly because I’m not cooking for my pa and partly because I’m not nine years old, but properly chopped ingredients do make a difference, so I try to do him and the dish justice. My kids like sauce, and I like sauce – in fact, I reckon I could survive mostly on rice and sauce – so the proportions below are just enough to enrobe the fish while maintaining its crisp edges. Sometimes I double them, though, to make more sauce so I can have saucy rice. Golden pan-seared fish with ginger and spring onions Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 2 1 sole, gutted and cleaned – you could also use pomfret, bream or ray wing 2 tbsp soy sauce 3 tbsp Shaoxing wine 1 tbsp sugar 4 tbsp vegetable oil 10g root ginger, peeled and finely minced 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced 2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped 1 tsp sesame oil 1 handful fresh coriander leaves, to garnish Wash the fish and pat it dry. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, wine and sugar. Put half the oil in a large nonstick or well-seasoned frying pan on a medium-high heat. Slide in the whole fish, and fry for a few minutes, swirling the pan to ensure the oil is evenly spread and to prevent the fish from sticking, much as you might when toasting sesame seeds or pine nuts, swirling the pan gently round and round until the fish is golden. Once the fish is golden underneath, gently flip it over and repeat on the other side until it’s cooked through. Transfer to a warm platter. In the same pan, heat the remaining two tablespoons of vegetable oil, then add the ginger, garlic and spring onions, and fry for a minute or two until fragrant. Pour in the wine, soy sauce and sugar mixture and let it bubble away until it thickens, adding a splash of water if it thickens too much. Stir in the sesame oil, then pour the sauce all over the fish. Garnish with coriander and serve with plain rice. Amy Poon is the founder of the Chinese heritage food brand Poon’s London.

          "bodyText": "The last time I saw Frankie Monroe, the impish, slightly grubby proprietor of Rotherham’s premier fictional working men’s club, The Misty Moon, he was in an Edinburgh basement, delighting festivalgoers with tricks, songs and cheeky characters. Unfortunately, we discovered as the show unfolded, the club was also a portal to hell. The night ended with Frankie – white-faced, in a shiny shirt and ludicrous shoulder pads – sucked into the fiery depths. It hasn’t done him much harm. Tonight, we’re at Manchester’s Fairfield Social Club, and Frankie is hosting a pub quiz with all the swaggering charm that saw his creator, 26-year-old Joe Kent-Walters, named best newcomer at this year’s Edinburgh comedy awards. It’s a real quiz, Kent-Walters promised earlier in the day, “but if you go in too much like you want to win, you will be infuriated”. There are questions on meat, service stations, disgraced men and “Great British bottoms”. Correct answers are superfluous: points are deducted for swots and snitches and added for the best bribes. West Yorkshire-born Kent-Walters’s comedy persona is inspired by the mischievous older men he encountered at working men’s clubs while visiting his dad’s family, and later in the local club he frequented. His favourites were those with the philosophy “You can’t kid a kidder”, who were always trying to confound you for a laugh. “I love being tricked,” Kent-Walters says. “I loved meeting those characters as a kid. Then later we’d go drinking and get picked on by the old guard, but in this way that was really warm and funny. I just love that world. I felt so lucky to be able to see it, growing up.” Frankie Monroe is an embodiment of those memories. In Kent-Walters’s current touring show, he steals wallets, challenges audience members to unwinnable games and dares us to touch his “special trowel” (there’s a wildly catchy song about the trowel in question that you’ll be chanting days later). Alongside his Edinburgh success, Frankie took Kent-Walters to victory at the 2023 BBC new comedy award, earning a BBC radio pilot, which he’s working on now. He also won the 2021 Chortle student comedy awards, as high-status “theatre wanker” Eduardo Soliloquy. Kent-Walters grew up in Denby Dale, a bus ride away from Huddersfield. “It was rural Yorkshire, very traditional,” he says. He recalls coming back from university wearing colourful trousers: “You couldn’t get away with that.” His parents, from working-class families in Billingham and Dunscroft, were both social workers, and “very encouraging of the arts ... I loved comedy because they loved it. They’d play Vic and Bob, The Mighty Boosh, The League of Gentlemen. Everything, really.” His mum recalls him entertaining the family on caravan holidays and, after he performed in a school play, signed him up for youth theatre at Huddersfield’s Lawrence Batley theatre. “That made me fall in love with performing,” he says. “I got to be weird.” Kent-Walters has “a little bit of an obsession with the old world of entertainment”. Frankie celebrates the variety-style nights that once graced the stages of working men’s clubs. “That’s been left to slowly die, and nothing has filled that void of community-based entertainment,” he says. In his early teens, after watching a documentary about George Formby, he became fixated with the Wigan-born entertainer. He joined the George Formby Society and got a banjolele for Christmas. “My parents wanted to watch normal telly and I insisted on putting these black-and-white George Formby films on.” He started playing Formby’s songs on stage at The Red Shed, “a tiny little Labour club” in Wakefield. “I’d rewrite Formby songs to be like ‘Fuck David Cameron!’” In hindsight, “that was the first time I started performing comedy”. He went to study theatre at the University of Leeds. He loved that it was “performance art-adjacent” and allowed him to indulge his interest in comedy history. He got “really obsessed” researching arts movements such as Dada, seeing how they connected to performers such as Vic Reeves. At his first Edinburgh fringe in 2017, performing in a serious play but determined to explore the festival’s comedy offerings, Kent-Walters found The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society, a late-night fringe staple where performers try their most outlandish ideas, and was confronted with “a fever dream of mad stuff”, he says. “Things I’d grown up loving, like The Mighty Boosh, you don’t realise it has its roots in live comedy. I remember turning to my friend and saying: ‘I want to be an alternative comedian.’” Back in Leeds, he started a monthly gig with friends in his student basement. It was called ACID – Alternative Comedy, It’s Downstairs. It provided space to experiment: “I used to do an act called 21 Carrier Bags. I’d be wearing carrier bags and do a bit of a strip tease, take them off and there’d be a gag in every bag. Or I’d just put a pillowcase on my head and eat beans.” He was also part of an art collective with coursemates – they’d put on themed, immersive events, with roaming characters, games and DJs, the partying interrupted by performances. A village fete-themed party, with homemade stalls and bunting, needed a host, and Frankie was born. “He came out the gate fully formed,” says Kent-Walters, keeping the festivities going until a “hell ritual” was performed at midnight. There were shades of this in Frankie’s fringe debut: flavours of horror, interactive games and a big demonic finale. He started performing comedy beyond the basement, although not yet as Frankie. “That was such a steep learning curve. Everyone thinks you’re great in this bubble of art school” he says, “then suddenly you’re performing to a plumber.” His best pal from school, Mikey Bligh-Smith, had also been experimenting with alternative comedy while studying in Bristol. “He had a character satirising a Bristolian hipster called Mandy Visuals,” Kent-Walters says. The pair formed a double act, the Lovely Boys, eventually performing a (very fun) hour at the 2022 fringe. They were fascinated by clowning and enrolled at eminent French school École Philippe Gaulier, whose alumni include Viggo Venn, Emma Thompson and Elf Lyons. “You spend a long time in comedy feeling like things are very not official,” says Kent-Walters. “With clowning, there’s a methodology, there’s a lineage, it sits in a cultural history. That felt exciting to me.” There’s a narrative that clown school breaks you down. “That myth’s perpetuated because most people there haven’t died on their arse in Barnsley,” he argues. There’s also a sense of exclusivity. It’s not cheap, says Kent-Walters, who worked through the pandemic to save for tuition, and it’s true there were “some really posh people”. But there’s another side to it. “I love the philosophy: everyone is funny,” he says. His biggest epiphany was about the importance of tricks: “That’s a great thing to watch, to think something’s going one way then it moves in the other direction.” He also realised his performance was best when he approached comedy “with lightness”. Frankie Monroe felt like the perfect character for these principles – he’d always been a trickster – and Kent-Walters started building an hour-long show, recruiting the director Jon Oldfield. “There was an interesting point developing the show where I was like: has it got to have a meaning?” He realised there was already deeper significance: lamenting the loss of clubs like The Misty Moon and the cultural life they held. Back at the pub quiz, almost everyone has had points deducted for swot behaviour, and there have been appearances from excellent local comedians including Freddie Hayes and Molly McGuinness. Kent-Walters treats us to a new character, Vegas Dave, “a kind of Brits abroad guy; he runs a club in Magaluf” who gets the room singing. It’s a taste of Kent-Walters’s next live show: in 2025, Frankie will emerge from hell, with new friends. “I’ve got an image of a big gravestone, ‘RIP Frankie Monroe’, everyone’s coming in sombre, funeral vibes. Then he’s bursting out, digging himself out with the trowel.” He hopes there could be a place for Frankie on TV – perhaps hosting a show like Alan Partridge or Mrs Merton. But he’s trying not to get swept up in post-awards hype, instead focusing on making new things. He’s just moved from Sheffield to Manchester – for love, and for its growing alternative comedy scene. “It’s an exciting place to be,” he says, “but there’s so much pressure to move to London. You second-guess yourself.” Advice from mentor figure John Kearns helped. “He was like: ‘Have a good life.’ We’ve got this idea of the sad clown, but the reality is, if you’re having a better time, people want to watch you more,” he says. “I like to believe that if you’re just nice and you’re good at the job, it’ll all work out. I’m sticking by that.” Joe Kent-Walters Is … Frankie Monroe LIVE!!! is at Soho theatre, London, 25 to 30 November, and tours the UK in 2025."

          "bodyText": "The choreographer Matthew Bourne rehearses his company in a studio in east London, a building instantly recognisable as the home of the BBC’s MasterChef. To reach it from the nearest station, you cross a thundering dual carriageway via a dank tunnel, and then follow the road past a branch of Tesco until you reach a bridge that takes you over a creek (the studio was once a water mill). When I first see it, this bridge strikes me as perfectly ordinary; in the water below, an Evian bottle bobs, disconsolately. But in the future, I will always think of this spot as a threshold, a portal to enchantment. On one side, heavy traffic and stray supermarket trolleys. On the other, the uncommonly strange spell cast by 30 young men in old T-shirts and baggy shorts leaping ever skywards. Inside, I watch this group dance for an hour, barely able to look away long enough to write in my notebook. The sight of them would, I think, be remarkable in any circumstances. Their boyish, mismatched kit only makes their movements seem the more tenderly expressive, and by doing so, wreaks havoc on the heart (mine feels like a steak that has been violently tenderised). But there are other things going on here, too. These men are the stars of the latest revival of Bourne’s Swan Lake, a show that not only changed the face of British dance – the swans, always danced by women in Tchaikovsky’s ballet, are famously performed by men in his version – but which has been in the world since before most of them were born (the new production, which runs into next year, marks its 30th birthday). This Swan Lake is often why they dreamed of dancing in the first place – perhaps they saw the film Billy Elliot, whose final scene features it – and to be cast means everything. Lez Brotherston, Bourne’s longtime collaborator and the piece’s designer, says that some dancers cry the first time they put on their feathered swan legs, and when I hear Bourne tell them in a break that their performances are “a little lacking in character”, I see no slumping of shoulders. Their commitment is absolute, an almost tangible thing. Even as they pull on their sweatshirts, every face is turned towards him. Does he really think they’re lacking in character? I ask him afterwards. I thought they were perfect! “Well, they’ve got a lot on their plate,” he says (Bourne, who is now a 64-year-old knight of the realm with countless hits behind him – including adaptations of Edward Scissorhands, The Red Shoes and Patrick Hamilton’s novel The Midnight Bell – is warm and generous, but at this point he’s not exactly smiling). “The principals started three weeks ago, and the rest two weeks ago. The work is intense at the moment. They’ve got so much information coming at them every day, their brains are frazzled. You have to be encouraging, but you also have to point out what’s not there.” Where would he say they are on a scale of one to 10? “A seven, though that number would be different for different people.” He asks me if I noticed that Harrison Dowzell, who’s dancing the Swan/the Stranger, was wearing trainers, as opposed to bare feet – which unnerves me because, in truth, I hardly did. “He’s got a badly stubbed toe that needs protection, so he has danced the whole rehearsal period in shoes so far – which isn’t great.” Bourne is looking forward to unveiling this production. It’s six years since it was last staged; new talent takes it forward. But it’s fascinating, too, to see it in a new context, the wider culture having shifted. “The thing that’s interesting about this version of Swan Lake, with two men dancing together in what seems like a romantic relationship [in Bourne’s version of Tchaikovsky’s ballet, the Prince falls in love with one of the male swans, and they dance an ardent pas de deux], is that when we first did it, there were people walking out – not a lot, but they did. But there was also something that was very acceptable to [other audience members]. It was a man and a swan, and perhaps that took the edge off it.” In a way, he’s surprised it didn’t change things in dance more: “Of course everyone’s doing it now: two men have danced on Strictly. But in ballet, it has happened for the first time only recently, in Christopher Wheeldon’s Oscar [which had its premiere in Melbourne last September]. He was very kind in an interview, referencing me as the pioneer, but he was the first to do it in ballet. We’re not a ballet company.” New Adventures is, he says “a dance theatre company”. It strikes me that in 2024, the erotic component of Bourne’s Swan Lake is less significant than the fact that male violence against women is on the rise: it’s moving simply to see men being so tender, so gentle (though his swans are also capable of violence). “Yes,” he says. “I know exactly what you mean, and I think that has been very appealing to audiences across the years, and it was one of my intentions: to have men move lyrically, as well as powerfully. You very rarely see men moving together like that.” But for all that Swan Lake continues to seem radical, albeit perhaps for different reasons now, his first impulse was, he insists, pretty straightforward. He’d got to the point where he’d seen Swan Lake on stage so many times, he was able to daydream a bit as he watched it. “And I just wondered: why are the swans female? There are male swans out there, after all.” When the opportunity to have a go at it came his way – his take on The Nutcracker for Opera North had gone well – he decided to go for broke: “We were a small, quirky company of six dancers then. We were upstarts, and we had nothing to lose.” He knew very well it might bomb. What he didn’t predict, even in his wildest dreams, was that queues would soon be snaking round the block outside Sadler’s Wells, where it opened; that it would win every award going (more than 30 of them, including three Tonys); that it would go on to become the longest-running full-length dance classic in the West End and on Broadway. What was the first night like? “I was terrified, really terrified. It was one of those times where you feel your legs are going to buckle. I couldn’t speak. It was packed and everywhere I looked there was a famous face from the world of dance … ” The audience, he says, was unprepared for what was ahead – and therein lay an important part of its success. “Nobody could imagine what a male swan looked like. I think they all thought they were going to come on in tutus. When Adam [Cooper, who danced the Swan/the Stranger] made his first entrance, and you saw a swan … they weren’t ready for it. I think we could have done anything after that, and they would have gone with it. They were so excited by it: the scariness, and the beauty. It was the shock of the new, and that wasn’t what I was expecting. And then, in the interval, they went out and talked to one another, and they decided they liked it, you could sense that.” Really, though, he can’t remember anything much beyond the moment in the interval when the producer Cameron Mackintosh pinned him against a wall and said: “This has to be in the West End.” Cut to the next morning. A couple of the older critics – notably Clement Crisp of the Financial Times – had an attack of the vapours (Crisp maintained his loathing of Bourne’s work thereafter, insisting that he couldn’t take him seriously thanks largely to his “unerring sense of what the public wants”, and that he was tired of his turning masterpieces upside down and “shaking them to see what falls out of their pockets”). *** Successful creative endeavours require alchemy. Some things are highly deliberate, others almost accidental. Adam Cooper wasn’t, perhaps, the obvious choice to dance the Swan/the Stranger at the time; he was a principal at the Royal Ballet, while Bourne’s background was in contemporary dance (he trained at the rather late age of 22, at what was then the Laban Dance Centre in south London). When Bourne went to ask Anthony Dowell, the Royal Ballet’s artistic director, if Cooper might be allowed a sabbatical to perform Swan Lake, Dowell was rather withering (though he said yes). “He said: so you want Adam to be the swan? Yes, I said. There was a long pause. Is there still a prince? he said. Yes, I said – and he went: Oh dear!” But it was worth being withered at: Cooper was crucial. “He was this thoroughbred, a creature from another planet. He made me take the role very seriously. I was always thinking of him, because I wanted to justify his decision to join us. If it had failed, it would have affected his career more than mine.” “It was a huge risk,” says Cooper, when I talk to him online (he’s in Germany, directing The Pirates of Penzance). “I remember the first time he told me he wanted me to play the lead swan. I thought he was just reversing everybody, so when he said there’d still be a prince [as opposed to a princess], I wasn’t sure. How’s that going to work? I thought. Two men working together? I had a colleague at the Royal Ballet who came up to me and said, ‘How dare you be a part of this? I hope you know what you’re doing.’ Some people thought of me as a bit of a Judas, doing something so anti-ballet. But of course, it’s not anti-ballet. It celebrates the ballet, but in its own way.” Before the opening night, he was nervous of the audience. “Are they going to stand up and walk out?” But in the event, what he felt mostly was relief. “I could hear that people were loving it, but I was so overwhelmed, it didn’t sink in until later, when it kept happening. The [noisy] curtain call, the queues. Oh my God, I thought. It’s something else completely.” There was a price to pay. In those days, Bourne had only one cast (now he has two, so dancers can rest). Cooper says that the part of the lead Swan involves “huge stamina … it’s an absolute killer because the choreography means you use every single part of your body, all the time.” Quite soon, his body was so overworked, he broke his foot. But the upsides were by far more important than the downsides: the chance to perform in the West End; the recognition of the new audiences it brought to dance. And of course, he had originated the role, so there was a feeling, not of ownership precisely, but perhaps of pride. “Historically, ballet directors are these men with sticks, shouting, doing the counts. Matthew’s not like that at all. He has a vision, but within that, he’s interested in other people’s ideas. He’ll always say, ‘What do you think?’” Isabel Mortimer, who danced the Queen in the first production, echoes all of this (her background, unlike Cooper’s, was in contemporary dance; I meet her in London). “What’s amazing about Matthew is that he can see things in people; he focuses on what you can do, not on what you can’t. He’s a curator as much as a choreographer. You can contribute.” In rehearsal for Swan Lake, she tells me, the cast was in a bubble. “It was only when some people started saying he shouldn’t be allowed to touch this iconic piece that we became aware of what the first night might be like” Like Cooper, the strain would eventually tell on her body; it’s unheard of for ballerinas to dance as many performances she did then: “We had to cut whole dances [when people were injured] because we didn’t have covers!” But in the end, she did it for 10 years, on and off. “It was life-changing,” she says. “I coach dancers now, and one of the things I talk about is mastery, which is to do with flow, not adrenaline. It was Swan Lake that taught me about flow. My mind would blank out, but my body would do what it needed to.” The last person in my Swan Lake jigsaw is Lez Brotherston, Bourne’s longtime set and costume designer – and talking to him is great. Creative people sometimes struggle to explain their work to outsiders, but Brotherston is like Bourne: both of them talk easily about what they do, without snobbery (I can’t help but connect this with the fact that Bourne thinks of himself as a storyteller who cares deeply about the experience of the audience). It is impossible now to imagine Swan Lake without Brotherston’s costumes – a pair of swan legs is on permanent display in the V&amp;A. But like everything else to do with the production, at the time, his head was mostly full of questions. “The first was: why men? Matthew said, well, swans are feral. So then I thought, OK, we’re talking masculine swans, so they’ll certainly be topless, and I’m assuming that bare feet is better than a jazz shoe. So then it was a case of: what kind of shorts are they wearing? Matthew had a picture of an Indian dancer in trousers that had bits of fringe on it, so I did a prototype along those lines, trousers with raggedy bits on them. In the end, the raggedy bits were silk, because when you wash it, it sort of goes like dreadlocks.” Brotherston oversees every new production involving his designs, “which is rare … I mean, I did Seven Deadly Sins with Martha Wainwright at the Royal Opera House in 2007, and when they revived it, the first I knew about it was an invite to a dress rehearsal.” It can be dispiriting, bringing the Swan Lake costumes out: they’re beaten up, ripped and mouldy. But 60 pairs of fresh legs have just been delivered, a moment he always finds peculiarly humbling: “Gosh, I think: a drawing that probably took me half-an-hour to do … and putting them on is a rite of passage for the dancers.” As a young designer, he used to say he would know he had truly made it if he ever saw someone in fancy dress who’d chosen one of his designs, à la The Rocky Horror Show. “And then it happened. I walked into a bar in New York. It had lots of photographs of its customers, and it had a Halloween night, and there were two guys dressed as swans. I was by myself having a drink. No one knew who I was. But I was so happy – my swans had made it.” Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake: The Next Generation tours from 11 November until 7 June 2025. It is at Sadler’s Wells, London, from 3 December to 26 January"

There is something really special about this weighty, solid thing that has the power to not only clean you but also make you feel as if the prosaic act of washing yourself is a luxury ritual. Shower gels never made me feel that way. Even the nicest smelling ones always managed to feel perfunctory. That has changed. I have discovered some wonderful liquid body washes – usually developed by perfumers – that are just a delight. Like the new bodycare line from Escentric Molecules. This fragrance brand has something of a cult following among editors and creatives. It pioneered – almost 20 years ago – the idea of a scent that has been created to smell completely different on everyone. It is a scent you cannot quite put your finger on but it is one I have found addictive for many years – on myself and others. So often I tell someone they smell really good and it turns out to be Escentric Molecules. Lately, I have been using their body wash – there are five scents (mimicking the fragrances). I love them all, but the original scent, E-01, never loses its allure. It combines spicy pink pepper, zesty lime and Iso E super – which perfumers create to add woodiness to a scent. It is stunning. Not only does it fill the air with the perfume, it makes the act of washing an indulgent experience, and one that lingers all day.

          "bodyText": "A dozen years ago – an eternity in American politics – the Republican party was reeling from its fourth presidential election loss in six tries and decided that it needed to be a lot kinder to the people whose votes it was courting. No more demonising of migrants, the party resolved – it was time for comprehensive immigration reform. No more demeaning language that turned off women and minorities – it needed more of them to run for office. “We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them too,” the party asserted in a famously self-flagellating autopsy after Barack Obama’s re-election as president in 2012. Even Dick Armey, a veteran Texas conservative, told the authors of the report: “You can’t call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.” Just one voice on the right begged to differ: Donald Trump. “Does the @RNC [Republican National Committee] have a death wish?” he asked in a tweet. His objection received little attention at the time, but it wasn’t long before he was offering himself as flesh-and-blood proof of how wrong the autopsy was. In announcing his first campaign for president in 2015, Trump called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He demeaned a female TV moderator, Megyn Kelly, at his first Republican candidates’ debate, saying she had “blood coming out of her wherever” and later implied she was a “bimbo”. He also called for migrants to be deported en masse and for Muslims to be banned from entering the US. No serious presidential candidate had ever talked this way, and for several months, mainstream Republicans regarded his approach as electoral suicide. Even once it became apparent Trump might win the party nomination, they still feared his candidacy would go down in flames because swing voters in the presidential election would “flock away from him in droves”, as party stalwart Henry Barbour put it. Then Trump won – and American politics has not been the same since. The country has not been the same since. It’s true, the US has never been quite the shining beacon of its own imagination. On the international stage, it has frequently been belligerent, bullying, chaotic, dysfunctional and indifferent to the suffering of people in faraway nations – traits that bear some passing similarity to Trump’s leadership style. But it has also, for more than a century, been the standard-bearer of a certain lofty vision, a driver of strategic alliances between similarly advanced democratic nations intent on extending their economic, military and cultural footprint across continents. After one Trump presidency and on the eve of another, it is now clear that a once mighty global superpower is allowing its gaze to turn inward, to feed off resentment more than idealism, to think smaller. Public sentiment – not just the political class – feels threatened by the flow of migrants once regarded as the country’s lifeblood. Global trade, once an article of faith for free marketeers and architects of the postwar Pax Americana, is now a cancer eating away at US prosperity – its own foreign invasion. Military alliances and foreign policy no longer command the cross-party consensus of the cold war era, when politics could be relied upon to “stop at the water’s edge”, in the famous formulation of the Truman-era senator Arthur Vandenberg. Now the politics don’t stop at all, for any reason. And alliances are for chumps. Last week’s election was a contest between a unifying, consensus vision laid out by Kamala Harris – and by that Republican autopsy document of the pre-Trump era – and Trump’s altogether darker, us-versus-them, zero-sum vision of a world where nobody can win without someone else becoming a loser and payback is a dish best served piping hot. The contest could have gone either way – there has been much talk of a different outcome with a different Democratic candidate, or with a different process for selecting her. Still, the fact that the zero-sum vision proved so seductive says something powerful about the collapse of American ideals, and the pessimism and anger that has overtaken large swaths of the country. In 2016 and 2020, that anger was largely confined to the white working-class staring down a bleak future without the manufacturing jobs that once sustained them. Now it has spread to groups once disgusted by Trump, or whom Trump has openly disparaged – Latinos, young voters, Black men. Kelly, the TV personality memorably insulted by Trump during his first campaign, stumped for him in Pennsylvania in the closing days of the campaign. Even undocumented migrants, ostensibly facing mass deportation once the new administration takes office, have been voicing cautious support for Trump because they believe his economic policies will improve their prospects, risks and all. At first glance, this is a baffling state of affairs. How could so many Americans vote against their own self-interest, when it is plain – both from past experience and from the stated intentions of Trump and his allies – that the chief beneficiaries of the incoming administration are likely to be the billionaire class? When the depressed, disaffected communities of the rust belt can expect little if any of the relief Trump has been promising but failing to deliver for years? The answer has a lot to do with the zero-sum mentality that Trump has sold so successfully. People across the country have lost all faith in the American dream: the notion that hard work and a desire for self-improvement are all it takes to climb up the social ladder, to own a home, to lay the foundations for the success of your children and grandchildren. They have lost their faith because the dream simply does not correspond to their lived experience. As in Britain and other post-industrial societies, too many lives are a constant struggle to get by month to month, with no end in sight to the bills and day-to-day living expenses and crippling levels of personal debt. The majority of jobs in the US now require some qualification beyond high school, but college is dizzyingly expensive and dropout rates are high enough to deter many people from even starting. Medical debt in a country without a national health service is rampant. Home ownership is simply out of reach. When people think of prosperity and success, what many of them see is an exclusive club of Americans, recipients of generations of wealth who live in increasingly expensive big cities, who have the financial flexibility to get through college, find a high-paying job and come up with a down payment on a house. The fix is in, as Trump likes to say. The game is rigged, and if you’re not a member of the club at birth, your chances of being admitted are slim to none. Under such circumstances, the Democrats’ promise of consensus leadership rings largely hollow. The consensus arguably broke a long time ago, when the bursting of the housing bubble of the early 00s left many would-be homeowners crippled by debt and led to the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. It broke all over again during the Covid pandemic, when the economy ground to halt, unemployment rocketed and prices of everyday goods spun alarmingly out of control. Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the past 16 years, yet their idea of consensus has failed to reach much beyond the big-city limits. More appealing by far to those on the outside looking in are Trump’s promises of retribution, of tearing down the entire system and starting again. Those promises may also prove to be hollow over time, but to people only intermittently focused on politics as they struggle to put food on the table for their families, they feel at least fleetingly empowering. In a zero-sum world, blaming migrants for the country’s woes feels like its own kind of victory. It means some other group is at the bottom of the social heap for a change. Overlaid on this grim picture is the slow implosion of the two main political parties. The coalitions held together by Republicans and Democrats were always complicated affairs: an awkward marriage of big business and Christian fundamentalism on the right; a patchwork of union workers, racial minorities, intellectuals and, for a long time, old-guard southern segregationists on the left. Now, though, what is most apparent is not their intricacy but their weakness. The Republican party was as powerless to stop Trump’s hostile takeover in 2016 as the Democrats were to hold on to their bedrock of support in the “blue wall” states in the upper midwest – Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. What drives American politics now is, rather, the unfettered power of money, much of it managed by groups outside party control who do not have to declare their funding sources and can make or break candidates depending on their willingness to follow a preordained set of policy prescriptions. The sway of special interest groups is a longstanding problem in American politics; think of the pharmaceutical industry lobbying to keep drug prices higher than in any other western country, or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee spending tens of millions to keep critics of the Israeli government out of Congress. But it has grown exponentially worse since the supreme court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which has fuelled an unprecedented growth in “dark money” – untraceable lobbying funds that far outstrip anything candidates are able to raise on their own behalf and tilt the political playing field accordingly. This, too, has given an edge to a demagogue such as Trump, whose vulgarity and bluster serve as useful distractions from a corporate-friendly policy agenda driven largely by tax cuts, deregulation and the dismantling of what Trump’s former political consigliere Steve Bannon calls the “administrative state”. The Democrats, meanwhile, can talk all they want about serving the interests of all Americans, but they too rely on dark money representing the interests of Wall Street, big tech companies and more, and are all but doomed to come off as hypocritical and insincere as a result. Two generations ago, the avatars of the civil rights movement were under no illusions about the brutal nature of the forces driving US society – “the same old stupid plan / Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak”, as Langston Hughes wrote in his famous poem Let America Be America Again. The hope then was this was at least a correctable problem, that the oppressed could push back against their oppressors and create a fairer, more just world. What nobody then envisaged was that the oppressed themselves – the working class, disaffected young Black and Latino men, even undocumented manual labourers – would one day support the rise of an autocratic government willing to overthrow every sacred tenet of American public life, and even the constitution itself, with its promise of creating “a more perfect union”. Yet here we are. In January 2021, at Joe Biden’s inauguration, the young poet Amanda Gorman invoked the spirit of the civil rights era in describing “a nation that isn’t broken but simply unfinished”. It now appears that her faith was misplaced. The US we thought we knew is broken indeed, and may well be finished."

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump has won, and most shockingly, he won the popular vote. Unlike in 2016, which could be explained as a rejection of Hillary Clinton concentrated in the crucial midwestern states, this year he won convincingly. He has increased his share of the vote, as a percentage of the overall national popular vote, in each of the three elections he has run in. Who voted for Trump and why? Many analysts of all political stripes have ready-made explanations for what happened, explanations that usually conveniently reflect the exact beliefs of the analyst. Unfortunately for them, the most common narratives do not stand up to scrutiny. The election results have blown a hole in the worldview of both the center and the left. One explanation for Trump’s victory is an across-the-board collapse in turnout and increased apathy caused by an unpopular presidency, an uninspiring president and an ideologically spent brand of liberalism. There is some merit to this, but on closer inspection, it’s not why Kamala Harris lost. First, it’s important to note that counting votes in the United States takes a very long time. By the time it’s all said and done, it’s quite likely Trump received more votes in 2024 than he did in the record turnout 2020 election, probably millions more votes. The second flaw in this idea is that the turnout change wasn’t uniform, nor was the change in voting behavior. In most swing states, turnout was actually up from 2020, setting records. In the states that decided the election, Democrats got their base voters to the polls and had the electorate they needed to win (and even did win in many cases in the Senate and down the rest of the ballot). The problem was Harris lost on persuasion: many voters who chose Joe Biden four years ago and even voted for other Democrats this year chose Donald Trump. Even then, where Harris campaigned on the airwaves and on the ground, she held up better than she did nationwide. However, problems with persuasion weren’t the only issue: Democratic turnout did, in fact, collapse in the less competitive states, especially in blue states. This is a unique shift in voting behavior nationally and can’t be explained obviously by most existing theories of the electorate. Another explanation is that Democrats have become the party of college-educated voters exclusively, and shed working-class voters, especially working-class voters of color. There is some truth to this, especially over the long term. But this explanation is also flawed. Trump did better consistently with every demographic almost everywhere in the country, including college-educated white people and women. While these numbers were more pronounced with young voters, Latinos and men, it was only slight. Most highly educated areas that had swung consistently against Republicans in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 moved back toward Trump this year. His victory was not with any one demographic. It was total. As with any massive election loss, recriminations have been swift, and factions inside the Democratic party are jockeying to make their narrative about the election the conventional wisdom that shapes the future of the party, while Republicans are claiming a sweeping call to reshape society in a darker, more authoritarian way. However, conventional ideological explanations also don’t stand up to scrutiny. One of the most common centrist takes has been: Democrats have become too progressive and “woke” on social issues and obsessed with identity politics, and Democratic staffers and consultants live in a bubble and speak in alienating ways that have made them seem radical and off-putting to the median voter. The solution is a relentless focus on bread-and-butter issues and moderating, mostly ignoring culture war issues, besides abortion, and aggressively playing up moderate and bipartisan bona fides. It seems quite likely this narrative will win out among Democrats. It has already been expressed by elected officials and influential Democratic pundits. The key problem with this narrative is that while it may have had merit in 2020 or 2022, Democrats already actually did this. The Democratic party has, over the last few years, aggressively purged “woke”-sounding language from their messaging and policies from their agenda. The Harris campaign was almost monomaniacally focused on projecting moderation and bipartisanship and on basic, kitchen-table economic issues. They relentlessly hunted the median voter with targeted messaging. They ran the campaign the popularists wanted, and lost. This theory is also belied by the fact that the most well-known progressive and radical politicians mostly did better than Harris. Rashida Tlaib performed significantly better, and while this was most pronounced with Arab and Muslim voters who rejected Harris over her stance on Israel and Gaza, it was even true in white working-class communities. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also won more votes than Harris. Understanding why thousands of people might vote for Trump and an avowed democratic socialist and vocal supporter of “woke” causes like trans rights is a key to understanding the election. Progressives see the flaws with the centrist analysis and also have an explanation, typified by Bernie Sanders: Democrats lost by abandoning the working class and unions. Like the centrist narrative, it is an outdated explanation that was once true and may be true on a generational scale but is inadequate to capture what happened in this specific election fully. While Democrats have, over the last 50 years, shifted away from unions and redistributive politics, allowing inequality to grow, and this is the correct explanation for Clinton’s loss in 2016, it doesn’t quite fit here. Joe Biden actually did shift to the left on economic issues after winning the primary in 2020, largely due to the mass movement that formed around the Sanders campaign. And while, in the past, this may have been lip service, the Biden administration, for all its shortcomings, did follow through in real, measurable ways. Income inequality, the central theme of the progressive movement in the 2010s, decreased under Biden. The poorest workers were better off. Biden also pursued aggressive pro-labor and pro-consumer policy through the executive branch. Biden was the first president to walk a picket line, and put political capital on the line to bail out union pension funds. For many years, it was easy to explain why workers would leave the Democrats: they were making less money and losing rights. But, while the Biden administration should have been far more assertive in redistribution and class-war policy on ideological and moral grounds, it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny that workers moved right because of an ideologically neoliberal or austerity-focused policy. Though Democrats have mostly abandoned class as a mode of communication, and struggled to name an enemy and construct a compelling economic narrative, the material explanation for Harris losing votes among the working class and union members doesn’t hold as it may have in the past. The right has its own explanation, seeing a sweeping mandate for the culture war. But Republican candidates who made their campaigns into referenda on culture war issues have uniformly lost or underperformed, in the past, and also this year. Trump is the only candidate who ran aggressively on the persecution of trans people, for example, and also did better than the partisan baseline. And the idea that this is why voters flocked to Trump is just not compelling. Fifty-four percent of voters thought Trump was “too extreme”, 65% were pro-choice and, even on immigration, 56% of voters supported a pathway to citizenship rather than mass deportations. Millions of voters voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and Democrats down-ballot to check his unpopular agenda. It would be a mistake to think Trump has a mandate to remake society in a hard-right, socially conservative image. So why did people vote for Trump? Most voters still actively dislike him personally (53% of voters had an unfavorable opinion of him) and most of his policies. The obvious explanation is that people trust him more to handle the economy. Although voters didn’t like his presidency, they felt like they were better off four years ago. This is true, but also so obviously true as to be facile. More interesting is why, materially, voters trust him more to handle the economy. The easy answer is inflation, but the case for this as the primary driver, materially rather than rhetorically, also has some holes. The first is that inflation has drastically decreased, and has been decreasing consistently since early in the Biden presidency. For most Americans, wages have risen faster than inflation, again for years in a row. When inflation was high and harming workers’ standard of living, Democrats were winning elections, historically over-performing in 2022 and sweeping special elections from the congressional level down to state legislatures and city councils. Many have proposed the idea of a “vibes recession”, wherein traditional and social media have given people a false idea of their actual economic conditions. But this answer is glib: politics are material and people actually do know their conditions. I propose a different explanation than inflation qua inflation: the Covid welfare state and its collapse. The massive, almost overnight expansion of the social safety net and its rapid, almost overnight rollback are materially one of the biggest policy changes in American history. For a brief period, and for the first time in history, Americans had a robust safety net: strong protections for workers and tenants, extremely generous unemployment benefits, rent control and direct cash transfers from the American government. Despite the trauma and death of Covid and the isolation of lockdowns, from late 2020 to early 2021, Americans briefly experienced the freedom of social democracy. They had enough liquid money to plan long term and make spending decisions for their own pleasure rather than just to survive. They had the labor protections to look for the jobs they wanted rather than feel stuck in the jobs they had. At the end of Trump’s term, the American standard of living and the amount of economic security and freedom Americans had was higher than when it started, and, with the loss of this expanded welfare state, it was worse when Biden left office, despite his real policy wins for workers and unions. This is why voters view Trump as a better shepherd of the economy. It’s important to note that Trump is resolutely not a social democrat, and these policies came into place during an emergency rather than due to ideological conviction. Indeed, he is currently running on the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history and Republicans’ Project 2025 would decimate the social safety net and immiserate millions. Beyond this, Biden wanted to continue many of these policies, but there wasn’t a political pathway. Instead, they quietly expired. To voters, however, the material reality is that when Trump left office, this safety net existed, and by the time of the 2024 election, it had evaporated. How could Democrats have countered this? One way was by making it a central issue, fighting publicly and openly to keep these protections and messaging heavily and constantly that Republicans were taking them away while Biden fought for them. An enormous body of research has established that social programs, when implemented, are difficult and highly unpopular to take away. These were universal programs, beneficial at all income levels. The political miscalculation the Biden administration made was that, lacking the political ability to implement these policies permanently, it was best to have them expire quietly and avoid the public backlash of gutting welfare programs and the black mark of taking a public political loss. This was a grave miscalculation. Why were Democrats unable to counter the idea that Trump was an economic savant? And why did most Americans vote for someone they believe will harm the country but help their own pocketbooks? The answer is the ongoing decimation of working-class institutions and civil society, started by neoliberalism, accelerated by the rise of the internet as a medium of interaction and put into overdrive during the isolation of Covid. The vehicles for building solidarity with others and for caring about strangers have been decimated. In crass terms, people have become more selfish. Union membership, for example, still makes voters significantly more Democratic than would otherwise be expected based on demographics alone. Even this year, Harris won union members easily while losing the popular vote overall. Unions and civil society organizations also provide a baseline of political education: members know their interests and which policies will help or harm them. Without this, Americans’ views are shaped by the algorithm. Perhaps most emblematic of this is at the heart of Trump’s campaign: his embrace of extremely online tech billionaires, crypto currency and online influencers. If the archetype of Trump’s win in 2016 was the left-behind post-industrial Rust belt manufacturing worker – or, perhaps more accurately, the car dealership or McDonald’s franchise owner in a left-behind post-industrial Rust belt town – this year it is the crypto scammer, the dropshipper, the app-based day trader, the online engagement farmer. That embrace was Trump’s message, and at the core of his gains, especially with young men. Without civil society and without strong unions, people believe the only path to success is getting one over on someone else. And who is better at that than Trump? While the core of the resurgent-left generation of Sanders was downwardly mobile college-educated professionals, selling their labor for wages without the prospect of buying a house or retiring on a pension, the second wave of newly aging-in Trump voters entered adulthood without even those prospects, hoping only to grind out a living through scams. But this is fundamentally an anti-social and anti-humanist mode of economic activity that contributes nothing to society and offers nothing but alienation to its victims. The result is people willing to vote for someone they know will cause immense harm to others, hoping it will help them personally. While the new right has made great hay of returning to a communitarian model of politics, economically populist, socially conservative, and focused on family and society, the truth is that the Trumpist movement is the opposite. It is hostile to the very concept of society and community. To combat this, we need an unabashedly pro-society left. The way to win back power for a solidaristic and humanist politics is to rebuild working-class democratic institutions. In 2020, Sanders asked the question: “Are you willing to fight for someone you don’t know?” This is the question we must ask over and over again and the work we must do is making sure the answer becomes yes. It will be hard: the right knows that their kryptonite is organization and community, which is why they plan to launch relentless attacks on leftwing organizations and unions. We will need new forms of organization in an era of hyper-online and state repression. We must be nimble and resilient. But it is the only path forward. The first goal? Answer the United Auto Workers’ call that unions across the country align their contracts for 1 May 2028, maximizing the collective leverage of the working class and giving workers across the country a shared goal and collective solidarity. In the meantime, we must rebuild organizations and unions, for a mass movement for solidaristic politics, for talking to your neighbors and co-workers, for fighting for someone you don’t know and for democracy itself. The story of 2024 was Americans voting for someone they know is a threat to democracy and for millions of people who are not like them because they were left worse off than they were four years before. If that’s the story of 2028, the very fabric of the nation’s democracy might unravel. This must not happen. Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC"

          "bodyText": "The original Taskmaster is already a miracle of construction, its success balanced on a razor’s edge. It relies on the perfect, unforced chemistry between its hosts (Greg Davies and Alex Horne – the latter also the show’s creator), an array of tasks that allow for blinding success, abject failure, deep misinterpretation and moments of genius as participants compete for prizes they have themselves brought in (the low stakes are a vital part of its workings), and the procuring of five celebrities – usually comedians – per series who can take it seriously enough to be funny but lightly enough not to bog the whole absurd confection down. In this they have succeeded magnificently for 18 series (and seven specials). Messing with perfection is rarely to be welcomed, and especially not when it involves the introduction of children. And so it is with astonishment as great as my joy and relief to report that the spinoff Junior Taskmaster, in which the competitors are all aged between about nine and 12 (please don’t make me use the word “tweenagers”) is a triumph. Comedian and actor Rose Matafeo takes the Davies role as main presenter with writer, comedian and former doctor Mike Wozniak as her sidekick, and their chemistry matches the original pair’s. She brings ebullience and warmth, he brings a deadpan approach and the air of bafflement that an Edwardian father might carry at a child’s birthday party. They both bring support to the children without coddling, an unerring ability to judge just how much ribbing the youngsters can take, and when to let them manage the banter among themselves. It’s like a non-fiction version of Outnumbered. And the children are equally great. The casting directors deserve awards for finding those rare birds who are confident but not cocky, quick on the uptake without being precocious, robust enough to cope with teasing and failure but young enough still to care about the outcomes (and the fairness – oh my God, the juvenile commitment to justice is on show at every turn. Give it up, my tiny chicks! The world will break you otherwise). The first set of prizes the contestants have to bring in is The Most Impressive Circular Thing they own. Nine year old Anita brings in her parents’ wedding ring inscribed with their pet names (“I guess I believe in love again,” says Matafeo, wiping a tear from her eye as Anita laughs) and Reuben, also nine, brings in a Shania Twain CD covered in maple syrup because she’s Canadian. “He’s pandering to the elderly millennial in me,” notes Matafeo. Do any of the other children own CDs? They do, and list their precious relics. “Ah,” says Wozniak, nodding sagely. “The ancient music of McFly.” To the tasks! Throw as many different things as possible into Mike’s open stovepipe hat as he sits on a large turntable, without touching the surrounding area! “I think that’s pretty comprehensive,” he replies when Nyarah queries the instructions. “To YOU!” she says, with quiet heartfelt fury. Hit a target in as interesting way as possible! Eleven-year-old Lazer pelts the thing with eggs and mustard. Anita constructs an elaborate narrative about blood and criminals before stabbing a fake finger. “Always so tragic to see paranoia clutch the young mind,” sighs Mike. Mike’s catchphrase as the overseer of the contests emerges as “All the information’s in the task”. In the second episode, tiny, bubble-curled Maisie asks him with curiosity: “Is this what you’ve been paid to do?” It is, and thank goodness. What could have been cringemaking, an exquisite agony to watch, is instead hilarious, charming and a fine piece of entertainment for all the family. The outcome of the mashed potato round, however, was wildly unfair. My inner 10-year-old demands a replay. • Junior Taskmaster aired on Channel 4 and is available on demand in the UK now, and will begin on Binge in Australia on 9 November."

          "headline": "The importance of freeing Earnest – without bursting Oscar Wilde’s ‘delicate bubble of fancy’",
          "bodyText": "I can’t think of many plays that have left such a strong footprint as The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde’s comedy has been parodied, pastiched and plundered by, among others, Tom Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Joe Orton. It has been filmed several times, inspired musicals and an opera and is one of the most quoted plays in the language. Yet, as Max Webster’s new production is about to open at the National Theatre, it strikes me that Wilde’s work is still the subject of endless debate. What kind of play is it and how do we stage it today? These are the questions that still divide opinion. People have been arguing about the true nature of the play ever since its premiere in 1895. Wilde himself described it as “a delicate bubble of fancy”, but added: “It has its philosophy.” At the time its philosophy was hard to discern. The critic William Archer spoke for many when he said the play was nothing “except a sort of rondo capriccioso, in which the artist’s fingers run with crisp irresponsibility up and down the keyboard of life”. Only after Wilde’s arrest did people begin to see that a play in which the two male leads invent fictive personae in order to escape domestic obligations was a metaphor for the author’s own double life. Today, I would suggest, we realise that the play is both funny and serious at the same time. It was Eric Bentley in The Modern Theatre (1948) who argued that “Wilde is as much a moralist as Bernard Shaw” and saw that The Importance offered a running commentary on class, money, marriage, economics, social hypocrisy, the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of commerce. That view inevitably affected theatre folk, and when Peter Hall directed the play at the National in 1982 he saw it as “a satire on the upper-class marriage market” with everyone, including Judi Dench’s magnificent Lady Bracknell, showing their desperate desire for a profitable alliance. But, while Hall took a clear line, there is an ongoing debate about how the play should be staged: one that reveals our divided approach to the classics. It came to a head in 1974, in the early days of Hall’s tenure when the National was still at the Old Vic and Jonathan Miller proposed doing an all-male production. Harold Pinter strenuously objected, arguing that one should respect an author’s intentions; Miller stood by a director’s right to reinterpret a play in any way they choose. Hall himself and associate director Michael Blakemore backed Miller while Olivier and John Dexter, also an associate director, supported Pinter. In the end, though, the project was abandoned, mainly for economic reasons. Today it would seem Miller’s view prevails, and there have been numerous attempts to reinvent Wilde: some successful, some not. In 2005 the Abbey theatre in Dublin offered an all-male version with Wilde himself as an onstage character. Ten years later, at London’s Vaudeville theatre, David Suchet was a majestically mercenary Lady Bracknell, itemising Mr Worthing’s assets with glittering precision. I much preferred that to Lucy Bailey’s age-blind production of 2014 at, ironically, the Harold Pinter theatre, in which Martin Jarvis and Nigel Havers repeated the roles of Jack and Algernon they had played 32 years earlier in the Peter Hall version: the concept, that we were watching an am-dram company staging a dress rehearsal in a country house, struck me as a licence for overacting. Even less appealing was Michael Fentiman’s 2018 revival at the Vaudeville, which seemed determined to heighten the play’s sexuality: we had Algy ostentatiously kissing his manservant and Jack discovered on the verge of orally satisfying Gwendolen. It is true that Wilde was a big influence on Orton, but here the process was rudely reversed. That doesn’t invalidate attempts to reimagine the play for today. But for me the test of any production is whether it reconciles Wilde’s spiralling absurdity and social commentary, and whether it respects the sublime elegance of his language. As Gwendolen herself says, “In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.” That strikes me as a good note for Wilde’s modern interpreters. The Importance of Being Earnest is at the National Theatre, London, 21 November-25 January, and in cinemas worldwide from 20 February"

          "bodyText": "Rafael Behr warns against relying on the cautionary lessons of the 1930s to address the current rise of far-right and nationalist politics (Left, right, Harris, Trump: all prisoners of political nostalgia in an era few understand, 5 November). Yet it is only by looking at the past that we can avoid repeating its mistakes. Yes, the 1930s shouldn’t be used as a stick to beat current-day nationalist supporters as deplorables. But it is more than helpful to study the source of their appeal in the 1920s and 1930s, and what was successful in countering them then. On the source, the Weimar Republic’s lack of margin to deliver substantial economic benefits to voters because of war debts and the 1929 financial crash (an early version of “there is no alternative”) combined with the enabling of the Nazis by big businesses and mainstream conservatives to protect them against rising support for the far left. Today, we can see the same mistakes being repeated all over the western world but, as we digest the US election result, what about the tech bros supporting Donald Trump or the willingness of mainstream Republicans to enable him? On countering their appeal, the only successful electoral strategy in the 1930s was Léon Blum’s popular front of far-left and centre-left parties in France. The lessons to counter the far right are many but, as an example, it points to why Spain and Portugal have been the most successful European polities at countering the far right. They also suggest that if Keir Starmer’s government doesn’t deliver tangible economic results, and continues to isolate the far left, we can expect a major political breakthrough by Reform at the next UK election. Patrick Costello Brussels, Belgium • Rafael Behr is quite right to note the problem of using “analogue” modes for contemporary digital politics. But two areas in his piece needed more attention. The first is the idea that “self-reinforcing information silos” dominate digital platforms – a nod to Eli Pariser’s “filter bubbles”. This, ironically, appeals precisely to the vision of modern liberal democracy that Behr is warning us against – ie extreme views arise because they aren’t properly challenged. Attractive as the filter bubble model is, research has shown that the realities are far more complicated and less siloed than we may want them to be. The second area is the somewhat natural conclusion of Behr’s argument that isn’t quite made: the state of politics is due to the insufficiency of modern liberal democracy to respond, or relate, to the evolution of capitalism into its current contradictory and self-devouring form far more than the digital platforms on which politics takes place. Prof Tom Grimwood Lancaster • Rafael Behr makes many astute observations, but is surely wrong on one fundamental issue – that the growth of digital over analogue political communication, beset as it is by echo chambers, trolling, misinformation and manipulation, is a matter of politics and economics, not technology. It is a consequence of the failed regulation of the tech giants that command these systems. Exacerbated by unprecedented inequality, the deep resentments and anger that result in such abominations as Donald Trump’s victory are not a reflection of a digital shift alone. Peter Golding Newcastle upon Tyne • Mr Behr tries out some pretty big and intriguing ideas in a very small space. Perhaps he would have been better off waiting 24 hours and then he could have written – I told you so. It strikes me that the disaster in Spain is a microcosm and reality check on the state of politics, whether you see it as a revival of rightwing tropes or not. In Valencia, the political model, “it is what we say it is”, came up against a reality that was totally predictable. Result, a complete catastrophe and needless loss of life. This model is being run across the world – in Putin’s Russia, in Italy and now, it seems, on a mega scale in the US. Surely it is a truism that the only defence against this deranged magical thinking is the parliamentary democratic process. Vladimir Putin has eviscerated it, Donald Trump has engineered his triumph by gerrymandering it in full sight. Philosophy and acres of journalistic soul-searching will not defend us or reverse this.

          "bodyText": "After months of angst and waiting, at the end of an election ride crazier than any in memory, after the assassination attempts and the bloodied ear, Joe Biden’s shock departure and Kamala Harris’s stunning arrival, after the childless cat ladies and the Springfield, Ohio, culinary dogs, after all the vitriol and the gathering sense of doom – at last, it was show time. Finally, tens of millions of anxious voters were done with the wildest campaign in their lifetimes and found themselves in that next stage of exquisite suffering that is the American way of democracy: the TV election night bubble. At least it was soothing to hear cable news rivals – as starkly divided as the presidential candidates they cover – find common ground as they opened proceedings. “It’s election night in America, in one of the closest and most consequential presidential races ever,” proclaimed CNN. “This is it, America! It’s time for you to decide the most unprecedented election of our times,” declared Fox News. As is traditional with US elections, the news of the first polls to close was as dramatic as watching paint dry. The first-in-the-nation states to wrap up voting were Indiana and Kentucky, both reliably in Trump’s bag. At 7pm on the east coast the temperature began to rise, with polls closing in six states that control 60 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. The first of the Big Seven battleground states to close its polling stations was Georgia. More than 5 million Georgians are projected to have voted, exceeding 70% turnout in what is turning out to be an exceptionally passion-filled race. Early exit polls from Georgia gave some troubling food for thought for the Harris campaign. While the vice-president did well with Black and young voters, edging up her margins on Biden’s four years ago, the exit polls recorded a sharp swing among independent voters, who make up 31% of the Georgia electorate. Trump was recorded in the exit polls to be up by 54% to Harris’s 30% among these voters – an eye-popping contrast to 2020, when Biden was favoured by 9% over Trump among independents. It was an early, and isolated, finding – how it pans out through the hours ahead could prove instructive. North Carolina, a state that has only gone Democratic in presidential races twice since 1976, is another of the battleground which both candidates have frantically sought and a must win for Trump. And North Carolina did become the first of the contested battlegrounds to be called, while votes in six other swing states were still being counted, as a win for Trump. As early counts came in, there were signs of Trump also narrowly edging ahead in key counties in Georgia. Should that razor-thin lead firm up, it would leave Harris having to win all three of the all-important Rust belt “blue wall” states – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – to keep her hopes alive. Relatively early in the evening, the North Carolina governor’s race was called for the Democrat, Josh Stein, over the embattled Republican lieutenant governor Mark Robinson, who CNN has linked to an online persona describing himself as a “black NAZI!”. Robinson has denied the allegations. But the fear in the Trump camp is that his fall from grace may harm the former president’s chances. As the night wore on, the Trump team expressed bullishness on their chances. Some had begun to talk about winning all three of the blue wall states – a phenomenon which, if it happened, would repeat how Trump tore down the wall in 2016. Florida continued its relentless march to the ultra-right on election night. As recently as 2016, Florida was seen as one of the pre-eminent battleground states. How different the Sunshine state looked on Tuesday, its 30 electoral college votes passing seemingly effortlessly to Trump. For the first time since 1988, the Miami region backed the Republican candidate. That fits the increasingly intense love affair between Trump and Cuban Americans in southern Florida. Whether it speaks of a wider drift of Latino voters from the Democratic party will be closely interrogated in coming days. Exit polls from Pennsylvania and Michigan both pointed to a similarly dramatic shift in the Hispanic vote towards Trump compared with four years ago, despite the controversy that erupted over the “island of garbage” remark made by a Trump surrogate at his Madison Square Garden rally. Florida, one of 10 states with abortion rights on their ballot, also rejected an amendment that would have secured the right to an abortion up to fetal viability. That leaves standing the current state law, in which abortions are banned after six weeks, a point at which many women are not even aware they are pregnant. As the first polls closed on the eastern seaboard, Trump and Harris retreated into their caves to await the coming storm. Both professed to have boundless confidence, though upon what basis was left to the imagination. Trump, who voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago home-cum-club, had limped towards the finishing line, a final blitz of rallies across multiple battleground states leaving him sounding hoarse and looking haggard. No wonder – he has been at it for the past 721 days since he announced his presidential run, making Harris’s 92-day sprint seem like a cake-walk. Even as he concluded his pitch for the presidency, Trump watered the seeds of potential election denial that he has planted in a chilling repetition of 2020. “If it’s a fair election, I’d be the first one to acknowledge it,” he told reporters as he emerged from the polling station, that “if” reverberating ominously in the air. Harris spent election day at the Naval Observatory, the vice-president’s residence in Washington, enjoying a few hours out of the public glare until Tuesday night, when she was poised to deliver remarks at Howard University, her alma mater, in the same city. As they awaited the people’s will, each candidate nursed their unique claim to history-in-the-making. Harris, 60, was bidding to be the first woman and woman of colour to occupy the Oval Office. Trump, at 78, would be the oldest president in the same space. He would also be the first defeated president in 132 years to re-enter the White House, not to mention that most inconvenient truth – that he would be the first convicted felon to hold the most powerful job on earth. The first tentative clues as to where the country might be headed were gleaned shortly after 5pm eastern time when an initial flurry of national exit poll data gave pundits something to talk about. Yet, typically for this most infuriatingly hard-to-read election cycle, there was plenty of red meat for both sides to chew on. For Harris and her cohort of millions of terrified Americans, convinced that a second Trump presidency would usher in an era of authoritarian rule, there was the affirming result that voters placed “democracy” at the top of their list of concerns. At 35%, the category came in above even that perennial electoral priority, the economy, stupid (on 31%). Abortion came in third at 14% – a warning sign for Trump, having orchestrated the abolition of the right to an abortion in Roe v Wade. Meanwhile, immigration, the issue that above all others Trump has hammered on the campaign trail for months, with his hordes of murdering, drug dealing “illegals” swamping the country, came in a lackluster fourth on 11%. The Harris campaign will also have been heartened by a gaping gender gap revealed by exit polls, with the vice-president winning women by a whopping 12 points (55% to 43%). Trump was conversely ahead with men by nine points, but the telling difference is that women tend to vote in slightly larger proportions. Democracy, abortion, the relatively low standing of immigration, gender gap. So game over? Not so fast. Over in Trumpworld, there were plenty of other contrasting reasons to be cheerful. Though the economy came in second in the list of voters’ issues, the figures beneath the headline were not good for Harris given her role as vice-president in the Biden administration. Asked how they rated the state of the US economy, two-thirds of voters in the exit poll said not so good or poor. Three-quarters said they had experienced moderate or severe hardship from inflation. Most punishingly for the Democratic candidate, asked whether voters felt better or worse off than four years ago – the exact same question with which Trump began every one of his Make Aamerica great again (Maga) rallies – 45% said worse off, with only 24% better off and 30% no change. As a long night got into its stride, firm indications of the future that lies ahead remained elusive. That left plenty of room for anxieties to fester about what comes next. At 4.39pm on election day, before any state had closed its polling stations, Trump began cranking up his election denial playbook, just as he had done in 2020. “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia,” he screeched on his platform Truth Social, alluding to a false claim that fake ballots had been distributed in the sate. “Law enforcement coming!!!” “There is absolutely no truth to this allegation,” a Philadelphia election official, Seth Bluestein, promptly retorted. Both sides have armies of lawyers at the ready, in anticipation of legal challenges on and after election day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence. It all points to much more angst and waiting ahead for beleaguered American voters – whatever, and whenever we know, the outcome.

          "headline": "With Spain still mourning Valencia’s flood victims, why did La Liga play on?",
          "bodyText": "Thousands of people were at Mestalla this weekend, huge queues all along Avenida de Aragón where Valencia’s players arrived, but there was no game on, not here. They came instead with water, food and clothes for victims of the greatest natural catastrophe the country has seen: floods that have killed more than 210 people and destroyed towns and lives in the Horta Sud, just inland and south of the city, where a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours. Hundreds of cars and vans turned up and unloaded, and many more made their way by foot. More than a million tonnes of aid filled the space under the stand, silent above them. Three-and-a-half kilometres away at the Ciutat de València, home of second-division Levante, the scene was much the same. Across the bridges that connect the city to the areas hit hardest, more came, carrying shovels and buckets. On the morning that Valencia had been due to play Real Madrid, 10,000 volunteers gathered at the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències, taken by bus to the areas affected, when they could get there at all. In the mud with them were some of the footballers they should have been watching at Mestalla. On Thursday, the federation ratified La Liga’s decision to postpone Valencia’s game against Madrid and Rayo Vallecano’s visit to Villarreal. In the second division, Levante-Málaga, Castellón-Racing Ferrol and Eldense-Huesca were postponed. On Sunday, as the “Dana” moved towards Andalucía, so was Almería-Cordoba. Everyone else played, though, starting with Alavés against Mallorca on Friday. After five consecutive defeats, Alavés won, but the coach Luis García, who forged his career in the region, from Altea to Villajoyosa, from Villarreal B to Elche and Benidorm, said: “However you look at it, playing this makes no sense.” He spoke for everyone, his the first voice of many. Getafe’s manager José Bordalás, a man born in Alicante and a man who spent 20 years coaching at smaller teams in the region, said: “These are difficult days for everyone; days pass and we’re still in shock. We see the pictures, hear all sorts of stories and its frightening … Football fans are focused on the tragedy. I don’t know what my colleagues have said, but this round of games shouldn’t have been played.” Many of Bordalás’s colleagues had said the same. “If I had been taking the decision I might have cancelled it,” Barcelona’s Hansi Flick admitted. “We shouldn’t have played, even if there were no dates [to replay the fixtures on],” insisted the Real Sociedad manager, Imanol Alguacil. As criticism grew, the league sought to justify its decision to continue. It didn’t talk about the logistics of postponements, the difficulties of finding space in a cramped calendar, or the problems it would cause people – and when have they cared about that anyway? It didn’t say that when the decision had been made it didn’t yet know the full scale of the horror, and it was too late now. Instead, La Liga’s president, Javier Tebas, claimed “the best message is to carry on”. This way, there would be “visibility” and “money raised”. As one colleague put it, sometimes football’s ego is as great as its greed. Its representation and thus its responsibility might be even greater still. Football is the most important of the less important things, they say. The usual line claims it is put into perspective when life is lost, and that is true, if not always the way it is intended. Because football, like life, tends to go on regardless. It is not alone – this weekend many other events were held, concerts, sports arenas, shops and theatres filled – and it can be easy to point an accusing finger at football alone, held to different standards. But that is at least in part because it claims those standards for itself, embraces its status as the expression of a people, because it is a bit different: a reflection of society, of human emotion, community, identity and belonging. Which is good for the business that truly interests so many in power. “It makes no sense. But we’re in a place where they tell us to carry on and so here we are, carrying on,” Atlético’s Diego Simeone said. It wouldn’t be entirely true to say that none of it mattered, that no one came and nobody cared. In the first division, 241,503 people attended the seven games played . It wouldn’t be true to say that they didn’t enjoy them either, that there was no drama and no brilliant games – Girona-Léganes and Athletic against Betis certainly were. Nor that there was no emotion, no celebration, no smiles or stories. No atmosphere or sense of occasion, at times. No silliness, even. At Montjuic, where Barcelona won 3-1 against Espanyol and at the Metropolitano where Atlético defeated Las Palmas 2-0, fans fell about laughing as they celebrated Vinícius Júnior winning the “Beach Ball”. The Espanyol coach, Manolo González, said he was “burning inside” at how his team had collapsed, and having to hear Barça fans taunting his team about heading to the second division. And Giuliano Simeone, scorer of his first Atlético goal almost 30 years to the day after his dad, described it as a dream come true. But none of it felt quite right, and certainly not the same, a guilt in every goal, every explosion of joy. Not least because the disaster was not something that had happened; it was something that was happening. As the weekend went on, and the football did too, the number of people who had lost their lives grew and so did the anger, the feeling of abandonment, that they had been failed. In Paiporta they threw mud at the king; it is all they have. The images kept coming: hard to watch, harder not to. The reports of the mess and the death, the smell. Pictures of the cars, crosses painted on the side to mark those they had checked for bodies; the awareness there were many, many more they had not yet. The fear that, with more than a thousand people still missing, the numbers would increase. Football is not immune ; although they’re often held up as supermen, accused of living in a bubble where they can’t be touched, players are not invincible. “The images on television are one thing; being there magnifies that five times,” said the Levante coach, Julián Calero, whose town was among those hit. “When these things happen you realise how fragile you are in the face of nature. It has taken so many people.” Valencia defender Rubén Iranzo’s home was flooded. There was solidarity too: the mother of Las Palmas’ Manu Fuster has a restaurant in Quart de Poblet, on the outskirts of Valencia, and fed those in need. The Valencia midfielder Pepelu guided those who needed help to another family restaurant, this time in Chiva. Pepelu did not play. Nor did Barcelona’s Ferran Torres, born in Foios, north of Valencia. “He said he didn’t feel he could come to the game,” Flick revealed. “Of course it is OK, I totally understand this.” Others who did play felt it was “inhuman”, like the Mallorca full-back Pablo Maffeo. “There are lots of us who have family and friends there, and we know they’re suffering,” he said. “Whoever does the schedule should take a good look at themselves. They’re more interested in money than in us.” Maffeo’s clubmate, Toni Lato, a former Valencia youth-team player from Pobla de Vallbona, described it as the game that shouldn’t have been played; “I don’t understand it,” he said. “My cousins are suffering, and I would have liked to have been there with them.” He had a word too for José Castillejo, a former teammate at Valencia’s academy, who died in the flooding, aged 28. On Saturday afternoon, Osasuna beat Valladolid 1-0 to briefly climb into a Champions League place. By Sunday afternoon their manager, Vicente Moreno, was in his home town of Massanassa, shovelling mud. The day before, during the pre-match press conference, he had been in tears. “[Vicente] is devastated,” Osasuna’s sporting director said. “He wasn’t in a fit condition to prepare this game; I honestly don’t know how he did it. He isn’t one to show his emotions but I saw him cry.” Moreno hadn’t been sleeping, his assistant, Dani Pendin, revealed: “We can’t be here talking about a penalty when there are people suffering.” When Ante Budimir scored that penalty to give Osasuna what ordinarily would have felt like a huge win, teammate Rubén Peña pointed him to a shirt in support of Valencia, which he held up in a scene repeated across the country, the disaster hanging over everything, a hand outstretched. There were minutes’ silences everywhere, stadiums gathering aid. At the Metropolitano, they played the Valencian anthem and the players held banners from supporters’ clubs in Paiporta and Utiel, two of the towns that suffered the most. Across Spain, players wore T-shirts with Bizum numbers on, encouraging viewers to donate to relief funds. Sevilla’s carried a message of support where their sponsor would usually be. When Miguel Gutiérrez scored the first for Girona in their 4-3 win over Leganés on Saturday he lifted up a T-shirt with a handwritten message on the front, dedicated to a friend called Henry. “His mum was carried away by the water,” Gutiérrez explained. “I get goosebumps just thinking about the images I have seen. She disappeared and she’s been gone for three days. We hope they can find her still alive but it doesn’t look good.” The following night, Castellón-born Pablo Fornals scored Betis’s opener in a wild game against Athletic, the last of a weekend that everyone could have done without. As he held up a shirt of solidarity, he cried then and again after. “We can’t control what the climate has in store for us but we can do things better,” he said, his voice breaking. “This wasn’t a day to celebrate anything but, as we had to play, at least we gave people a good night of football.” Click to view La Liga results and league table"

          "bodyText": "That’s all for tonight. Thanks for your company, see you soon. Pat Cummins’ verdict I always prefer sitting in the changing-room but yeah, we got it done. It got a bit tighter than we’d have liked. I was really happy with the way the guys bowled; everyone played their really beautifully and to keep them to 203 was a great effort. We were really good for three-quarters of the runchase. We try to be aggressive with the bat and that won’t always come off. But I think there’s still room to build a couple of partnerships. Steve Smith’s reaction They bowled alright in the middle there. They went quite short with the long boundaries – we kept taking it on and kept failing! Patty played nicely and Sabba [Sean Abbott] played pretty well before a bit of a brainfade. It’s good to get over the line. It wasn’t the easiest wicket to bat on. Some balls were stopping in the wicket and others were skidding on nicely. The bounce was a bit variable at times. But I felt good out there. I felt like I was balanced and moving well. I think Patty has his eyes done recently so they’re obviously working well. What a terrific game that was. Australia were cruising at 113 for 2 before Haris Rauf found his way into the zone. He took three quick wickets to help reduce Australia to 159 for 7. At that stage Pakistan were slight favourites, but Pat Cummins batted with such authority to get Australia over the line. 33.3 overs: Australia 204-8 (Cummins 32, Starc 2) Pat Cummins has done it again! He thumps Hasnain down the ground for four to bring the scores level before forcing the winning run past backward point. Cummins finishes on 32 not out from 31 balls, another masterclass in lower-order finishing. Since the start of the 2023 Ashes, across all formats, he has scored 134 runs in successful Australian runchases without being dismissed. He’s the new Michael Bevan! 33rd over: Australia 199-8 (Cummins 27, Starc 2) Rauf looks shattered, understandably after bowlign nine of the last 21 overs. Australia settle for a couple of easy singles, which brings the target down to five – and Cummins is on strike. 32nd over: Australia 197-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 1) Starc slashes a single off the last ball. Seven to win, Haris Rauf to bowl. It’s now or never. 31.2 overs: Australia 196-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 0) Naseem Shah bowls two balls to Starc but then limps off with cramp. Mohammad Hasnain will complete the over. 31st over: Australia 196-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 0) Cummins slaps a short ball for Rauf for four; then, after a bouncer is called wide, he looped a couple more over backward point. Twelve to win. Eight to win because Cummins has just driven an imperious boundary over extra cover. That’s a helluva shot. Cummins is fast developing a reputation as one of the great lower-order finishers. He’s no Lance Klusener, admittedly, but his coolness and clarity under pressure are pretty remarkable. 30th over: Australia 185-8 (Cummins 16, Starc 0) Starc survives the last two balls from Shaheen Afridi, who finishes a fine spell with figures of 10-0-43-2. Nineteen to win. Another twist in this pulsating game! The non-striker Abbott was called through for a third run off Afridi, who collected a throw from the deep and demolished the stumps at the striker’s end! Abbott, who looked reluctant to go for a third, wasn’t sprinting and got a very nasty surprise. 29th over: Australia 181-7 (Abbott 13, Cummins 12) The dangerman Haris Rauf returns after a short break, perhaps too short. I guess Pakistan have no choice. Cummins survives a run-out chance after being sent back by Abbott. He was barely in the frame when Haris collected in his follow through, turned and threw this far wide of the stumps at the non-striker’s end. Abbott clips the next ball just short of midwicket, then jumps across to work a precious boundary to fine leg. Suddenly Australia only need 23. 28th over: Australia 173-7 (Abbott 6, Cummins 11) Shaheen Afridi, who has two overs left, replaces Hasnain. Cummins smiles after a terrific bouncer zips past his right shoulder, and he and Abbott are content with three low-risk singles. 27th over: Australia 170-7 (Abbott 4, Cummins 10) Pakistan have decided to pepper the lower order, and so far it isn’t working. Naseem bowls two more wides before he finds his length and drives Cummins back with some good short balls. The silly point – it’s Kamran Ghulam – is still rabbiting on in an attempt to drag Cummins out of his bubble. Good luck with that. Time for drinks. Australia need 34 runs to win a memorable ODI. 26th over: Australia 167-7 (Abbott 3, Cummins 10) Cummins’ batting usually goes to another level in tense situations: Birmingham, Mumbai, Christchurch, even his debut in Johannesburg. Cummins forces his first ball superbly through backward point for four, then gets a bit of a luck when an inside-edge whooshes past leg stump. A couple of short balls are called wide and then Cummins drags a pair of twos into the leg side. Not sure Pakistan can risk another over from Hasnain; he took an important wicket but also conceded 12 from the over. In other news, that 40 from Naseem Shah looks ever more valuable. Australia need 37 to win. Pakistan are three wickets away from an immense victory! Hardie backs away to cut Hasnain, misses and is cleaned up. For the umpteenth time in the last couple of years, Pat Cummins walks to the wicket just as the clock hits squeaky-bum time. 25th over: Australia 155-6 (Hardie 10, Abbott 3) After squeezing down some energy gel, Naseem Shah takes over from Haris Rauf. Abbott is beaten, trying to pull, then fences a short ball through the vacant short leg region. 24th over: Australia 154-6 (Hardie 9, Abbott 3) Mohammad Hasnain replaces Afridi, who has two overs remaining. Hardie is hit on the back thigh by a good nipbacker. The bowler doesn’t appeal for LBW, then starts jumping around when he realises Rizwan has gone up. Pakistan ventually decide against a review, rightly so: it was bouncing over the top. Australia need 50 from 26. Overs, not balls. 23rd over: Australia 151-6 (Hardie 6, Abbott 3) Pakistan are full of the joys of haal. The man at silly point, not sure who it is, is chirping incessantly in a peculiar high-pitched squeak. Haris takes a brief time out after falling over in his delivery stride three times in a row. I think he scraped his left knee but he’s okay. That said, he probably needs a breather after a scorching six-over spell. “Am I right in thinking that this is an unusually old Australian team, especially in its bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “After India’s shellacking at the hands of New Zealand, it does feel a bit like some of the familiar faces that have been at the heart of cricket may be on the way out. I suspect England might just be ahead of the curve a little by going very young, very early. Though there’s nothing like small sample spaces to provoke a little confirmation bias.” The probable XI for the first Test against India includes ten thirtysomethings. Then again, Australia have often had successful older teams; the one that marmalised England in 2006-07 had an average age of about 50. England’s advantage, in the short term, might be that their best players are a year or two younger than Australia’s and India’s. 22nd over: Australia 148-6 (Hardie 5, Abbott 2) Rizwan may as well bowl his three senior quick bowlers out, because this game isn’t going much beyond the 34th over (Hasnain has bowled four). Shaheen’s eighth over is a quiet affair, including five consecutive dot balls to Hardie. 21st over: Australia 147-6 (Hardie 5, Abbott 1) Two big moments of fortune for Aaron Hardie! He fences Rauf just short of backward point, then edges a cut that flashes past the leaping Rizwan and away for four. Australia were strolling to victory at 113 for 2 and 139 for 3; now they’re ina desperate fight for survival. Only Pakistan. 20.3 overs: Australia 140-6 (Hardie 0, Abbott 0) The hat-trick ball is too straight and clipped for a single by Abbott. Rauf put so much effort into it that he fell over, Mark Wood-style, then slapped the ground in frustration. Pakistan are in cornered tigers mode! Glenn Maxwell goes first ball, touching a seriously hot, back-of-a-length delivery from Haris Rauf through to Mohammad Rizwan. Only Pakistan can do this. Now then! Labuschagne gets in two minds and deflects a short ball from Rauf all the way down to third man, where Irfan Khan slides forward to take another good catch. It’s his third of the innings and his second in the last four balls! 20th over: Australia 139-4 (Labuschagne 16, Hardie 0) Australia still have plenty of batting to come, including Glenn Maxwell. Even so, another quick wicket would make things interesting. A fantastic catch from Irfan Khan at deep midwicket! Inglis has pulled the previous ball for six – Irfan palmed it back into play quite brilliantly but stood on the boundary sponge before jumping – and tried to reach his fifty with a similar stroke. Irfan charged round the boundary and reached forward to take a terrific two-handed catch. 19th over: Australia 130-3 (Inglis 41, Labuschagne 15) Labuschagne squirts Rauf for three to move to 15 from 11 balls. He’s often Australia’s shepherd at No5, guiding them to a target after a flying start from the top four, but today he’s playing with a breezy freedom. 18th over: Australia 123-3 (Inglis 40, Labuschagne 9) Pakistan’s body language suggests they believe they can still win this, which depending on your perspective is either admirable or denialistic. Is that a word? It is now! Labuschagne moves Pakistan closer to defeat by driving Afridi expertly to the long-off boundary. 17th over: Australia 117-3 (Inglis 38, Labuschagne 4) Labuschagne gets off the mark by uppercutting Rauf over slip for four. Rauf is frustrated but it was a safe shot once Labuschagne got under the ball. Australia need 87 from 198 balls. Steve Smith is furious with himself. He was playing superbly, almost flawlessly, until suddenly he slapped a short ball straight to backward point. Saim Ayub took a smart catch, his second of the innings. Smith knows he’s left a few runs out there; even so, the certainty of his strokeplay is a good sign for the summer ahead. 16th over: Australia 107-2 (Smith 40, Inglis 38) Shaheen Shah Afridi returns after the drinks break. He goes around the wicket to Inglis, who wallops a drive that is well stopped at extra cover. Two from the over; Shaheen has been the pick of the Pakistan bowlers. Drinks Australia need 99 from 35 overs, and they might just do it. 15th over: Australia 105-2 (Smith 39, Inglis 37) Inglis edges straight between the keeper and a widish slip for four. An affronted Haris Rauf spears the next ball down the leg side for five wides. This is getting away from Pakistan in a hurry; in the commentary box attention has turned to whether Josh Inglis will/should open the batting in the Test series against India. Nathan McSweeney is in pole position but you can understand the excitement around Inglis. I would probably keep him as the next middle-order cab off the rank; asking him to learn a new position against Jasprit Bumrah feels more than a little risky. 14th over: Australia 93-2 (Smith 37, Inglis 32) Smith pays tribute to that Inglis with an almost identical boundary off Hasnain, whose fourth over disappears for 15. Inglis hooks very fine for six before cuffing a short ball disdainfully over midwicket for four. After a slightly awkward start against Naseem Shah, Inglis is flying: 10 from the first 19 balls, 22 from the next 8. 13th over: Australia 78-2 (Smith 32, Inglis 22) Haris Rauf replaces Naseem Shah, who bowled more menacingly than figures of 5-0-35-1 might suggest. After Smith edges a good ball wide of slip for a single, Inglis threads a superb drive between extra cover and mid off for four. He attacks with such authority. 12th over: Australia 72-2 (Smith 31, Inglis 17) The box seat is never entirely comfortable against Pakistan, whose fast bowlers can run amok at a moment’s notice, but right now Australia look in control of this chase. Smith turns Hasnain behind square for a couple to move into the thirties. 11th over: Australia 68-2 (Smith 28, Inglis 16) Naseem continues hunting for wickets; there’s no point saving his overs because the game will be done if Pakistan don’t get a couple more very quickly. Inglis pushes at another sharp lifter and then thinks better of it; that probably still does down as a play and miss. Inglis, tired of being a bit of a punchbag, fetches a short ball from outside off stump and over midwicket for a big six. Shot! 10th over: Australia 61-2 (Smith 27, Inglis 10) When Steve Smith’s hands and eyes are perfectly in sync, bowling to him feels like the definition of futility. Saying which, he almost runs himself out with a very tight single to mid-on; it would have been Spandex-tight with a direct hit. “Shout out to my son Josh, who’s at the game,” says Rob Lewis. He’s been living Down Under for two years, and he still clings on to his support for England. I hope and pray it continues!” Next year’s Ashes just got even bigger! 9th over: Australia 59-2 (Smith 26, Inglis 9) Inglis is dropped off Naseem Shah, who has changed ends to replace Shaheen. He was startled by a brutish lifter and could only fence the ball towards gully, where Irfan Khan dived high to his right and tipped it over the bar. Batting looks pretty tricky out there – except for Steve Smith, who lashes another majestic boundary through point. He has 26 from 21 balls. 8th over: Australia 54-2 (Smith 22, Inglis 8) Steve Smith is the perfect man, and I say this with love, to suck the jeopardy out of the run-chase. He drives the new bowler Mohammad Hasnain beautifully down the ground for four, just to the right of the stumps at the non-striker’s end, and is starting to look a bit ominous for Pakistan. An emphatic pull for four more takes him to 22 from 18 balls. 7th over: Australia 45-2 (Smith 14, Inglis 7) Shaheen continues to swing the ball back into the right-handers; nothing lavish but enough to make the batters wary of anything straight. Just three runs from the over. 6th over: Australia 42-2 (Smith 12, Inglis 6) Josh Inglis was in great form in the Sheffield Shield, making centuries in both games last month. After missing one attempted cut off Naseem, he nails the stroke past cover point for four. It’s high-octane stuff out there. Australia are still strong favourites but Pakistan are aggressively protecting an under-par score as only they can. 5th over: Australia 36-2 (Smith 12, Inglis 1) Pakistan are on one. Smith is hit on the glove by a nasty lifter from Shaheen, who then has an LBW appeal turned down when Smith plays across a good delivery. It was too high and would have missed off, but it will enhance Pakistan’s belief that something is happening. Smith does not share that view and moves into double figures with a smooth pull round the corner for four. 4th over: Australia 28-2 (Smith 5, Inglis 0) That was the last ball of the over. Fraser-McGurk cloths Naseem Shah straight to mid-on. He’s been teasing the fielders, mistiming shots all over the place, but this time he picked out Irfan Khan. Fraser-McGurk goes for 16 from 14 balls; while he’s the definition of box office, you can argue that that was a pretty ugly innings, unbecoming of somebody with his talent. He basically tried to hit every ball for four or six. 3rd over: Australia 21-1 (Fraser-McGurk 13, Smith 2) Steve Smith gets off the mark with a confident hook for two. Pakistan are hunting wickets, knowing that’s the only way they can win this game. An early breakthrough for Pakistan. Short tries to pull Afridi, a shot that is usually so profitable, but the ball is angled across and he top-edges it towards third man. Three men converge and Saim Ayub, running back from inside the circle, takes a terrific catch over his shoulder. 2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Short 1, Fraser-McGurk 12) Strap in, folks, Jake Fraser-McGurk is batting. He drives Naseem Shah’s first ball high over mid-off, but doesn’t time it properly and almost gives a catch to Babar Azam. Babar charged desperately towards the boundary and couldn’t quite get there. An extravagant chip over mid-off teases the fielder before landing safely for a couple more runs, then Fraser-McGurk launches an emphatic first boundary over wide mid-on. Four leg-byes and a quick single complete a very profitable over, 14 from it. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Short 1, Fraser-McGurk 3) There’s some early inswing to the right-handers for Shaheen, but he’s a bit too straight and that allows both openers to get off the mark with clips to leg. A quiet start. The players are back on the field. Shaheen Shah Afridi is about to open the bowling to Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk, and I would suggest a maiden over is unlikely. Thanks Angus, afternoon everyone. We should probably have expected this. Pakistan have a wretched recent ODI record both against and in Australia: they’ve won only 8 of the last 40 games between the sides. And it’s likely to become 8 from 41 despite the infectious defiance of Naseem Shah, who smashed four sixes from No9 to take Pakistan past 200. Even so, the last time Australia failed to chase a target of 204 or less at home* was against New Zealand in January 2002, when Steve Waugh was starting his last month as white-ball captain, Mulholland Drive was scaring the bejesus out of cinemaphiles and a love was burning inside Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. It was a lifetime ago. * Barring a DLS game in 2007 when they were chasing 186 from 27 overs, which doesn’t count. The visitors did well to smash, grab and scamper their way to 200 in the end but this first ODI is still very much Australia’s game to lose. Their bowlers were relentless, with Mitchell Starc the pick, finishing with 3-33. Pat Cummins chimed in with 2-39 and Adam Zampa returned 2-69, including the key wicket of Babar Azam, a victory soured somewhat by the late stick he copped from No 8 Naseem Shah who whacked a valuable 40 from 39 balls. Pakistan’s top order crumpled like a cheap suit and it was left to their middle order and tail to salvage some pride. But will 203 runs be enough against an Australian wrecking crew featuring Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk? Join Rob Smyth after the dinner break to find out. Cummins finishes it! Pakistan had fought hard to get to 200 thanks to Naseem’s fireworks but they flopped over the line with nothing left. After all that masterful blasting it’s a slower ball that undoes Naseem. He misjudges the drive and pops a simple catch to Starc at midoff to finish the Pakistan innings. 46th over: Pakistan 203-9 (Naseem 40, Hasnain 1) Zampa comes back to deliver the coup de grace. Or does he? Naseem won’t go down with a whimper. He takes a single from the first and exposes No 11 Hasnain. But the bunny gets a runny and WHAM! Naseem plunders Zampa’ next ball, sending it over the long on fence. SIX! Fifth ball is wider and has more fizz on it but Naseem doesn’t care. He dances out of his crease again and and lofts it over cover for FOUR. Nice batting Naseem. And what a way to finish the over as Naseem swings through the line and sends it dead straight for another SIX! 45th over: Pakistan 184-9 (Naseem 23, Hasnain 0) Glenn Maxwell whirls through an over and Naseem picks off a single. Can Pakistan make 200? 44th over: Pakistan 183-9 (Naseem 23, Hasnain 0) Big appeal by Australia. Zampa shot it through quick on new batter, No 11 Mohammad Hasnain, who pushed forward and missed. It’s a good shout but umpire says no. Cummins disagrees and opts to review. Yes it’s inline but original decision will stand. RIP Mister Rauf! That was foolhardy stuff with six overs left to bat. Instead the youngster tried to whip a straight ball zooter through midwicket and missed. 43rd over: Pakistan 182-8 (Naseem 14, Rauf 0) Maxwell is taken downtown! That’s a lovely six from Naseem who skipped down and merrily plonked it a few rows into the grandstand down the ground. Haris Rauf is the new batter. He has 65 runs from his 15 ODIs for Pakistan but at least they’ve come at a strike-rate of 85.55. Terrible mix-up from the Pakistan batters and Irfan is gone. He played a smart reverse swat to Maxwell’s first delivery and it looked an easy single but the youngster hesitated for a second and slipped. The Matt Short throw to Maxwell was quick and flat – too quick for Irfan. Out! 42nd over: Pakistan 175-7 (Irfan 22, Naseem 14) Despite being off the pace all day, Pakistan have scrambled themselves within sight of 200. If they can get there, or beyond, who knows? They have a long tail for batting but that means it carries a sting when it comes to bowling. Will the absence of big hitters Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh – both of whom are on paternity leave – come back to haunt Australia in their run chase? Abbott puts the clamps on in his eighth over – just three singles from it 41st over: Pakistan 172-7 (Irfan 20, Naseem 13) As Pat Cummins rolls in for his ninth over and Paistan’s plucy tailenders hang in there with some stubborn resistance, Simon Chance gets in touch via email to mourn the dearth of coverage on free-to-air television for this series which runs solely on Foxtel and Kayo: Hi Angus, what a pity CA have gone behind the paywall with one day international cricket mens games played in Australia. There cannot be a swifter way to kill interest in the game – as the Rah Rah Rugby Union boys have found out. If they can’t be bothered making it available on free to air then I cannot be bothered with it at all. 40th over: Pakistan 169-7 (Irfan 18, Naseem 12) Sean Abbott’s first ball in his seventh over is a no-ball and it gifts Naseem a free hit. What can he do with it? Abbott angrily hurls it down short but it’s a slower ball and Naseem has the rhythm to meet it on the up. SIX! Lovely shot by the youngster – that’s gone 85-metres on the fly over midwicket. That’s his first six for Pakistan in one-day internationals and it’s a beauty. 39th over: Pakistan 159-7 (Irfan 17, Naseem 5) Pat Cummins is back into the attack for an eighth over. Irfan wafts at the second ball and almost edges. There’s more timber on the third and he gets a single square of the wicket. Naseem gets one as well, fending to gully. Cumminss tries to dig the final ball in short but Irfan picks the gauntlet up and return it with interest, slapping a stabbing pull over midwicket for a boundary. 38th over: Pakistan 153-7 (Irfan 11, Naseem 3) Naseem Shah is the new batter and he sees out the Starc over to leave the big quick with the excellent figures of 3-33 from 10 overs. Now Zampa has the new batter on strike but Naseem is equal to the task. he takes two and then a single to hang onto strike. Stumps akimbo! Having blasted 24 from 19 balls, Shaheen wanted another boundary and Starc was savvy to the threat. The Australian went full and straight, swung it slightly across the line and it went through Shaheen like a dose of salts, sending the timber flying. That’s three wickets for Mitchell Starc today. 37th over: Pakistan 148-6 (Shaheen 20, Irfan 11) Mitchell Starc enter his final over…. and Shaheen shows him the exit, lifting it over mid-off for another FOUR. Good batting by the Pakistan veteran. How will Starc repond? 36th over: Pakistan 144-6 (Shaheen 20, Irfan 11) That one is up… and OVER! Zampa tossed it up to Shaheen Shah Afridi skipped out and took him downtown for SIX! And the veteran No 8 does it again to the fifth delivery, moving his feet and giving it a big whack to the rope for FOUR. Good over for Pakistan – 10 runs from it. 35th over: Pakistan 130-6 (Shaheen 7, Irfan 10) Australia want a quick finish. They have brought back Starc for a final blast. Shaheen takes a quick single from the first but balls two and three are wide. Irfan connec ts handsomely with the fifth which was full and straight and right in the batter’s slot. He sweep it sweetly backward of square. 34th over: Pakistan 128-6 (Shaheen 6, Irfan 9) Zampa is back… and after four neat balls Zampa is GONE! as Irfan sweeps cleanly to the fine leg boundary. 33rd over: Pakistan 124-6 (Shaheen 6, Irfan 5) Ah, the ignominy of falling to Marnus. Rizwan had 44 and was within one shot of a half-century. But he blundered into Cummins’ trap and tried to double-dip on the mercurial part-time spinner. Normal service has resumed now as Hardie works through his fopurth over. And WHACK! goes new batter Shaheen Shah Afridi who bullets a lofted drive over Hardie’s head and over the fence! Marnus magic at the MCG! Having rolled the dice and bowled a couple of wildcards in Matt Short and Glenn Maxwell Cummins looked to have regained his senses by turning to Aaron Hardie. Instead he flipped out the ultimate Joker and it’s worked! Rizwa’s eyes lit up at Australia’s No 3 batter coming on to bowl and carted him for four. But Labuschagne had the last laugh one ball later. Rizwan leapt out to sweep it again and only succeeded in getting a top edge and Inglis took a great running catch. Pakistan’s captain is gone! 31st over: Pakistan 116-5 (Rizwan 40, Irfan 3) Aaron Hardie gets another over after his brief spell this morning. Rizwan slaps him over mid-on for four. That’s more like it! 30th over: Pakistan 108-5 (Rizwan 36, Irfan 3) Having bowled Matt Short for an over, Cummin has played another wildcard. It will be Glenn Maxwell into the attack. Heavily bearded and bristling with energy, the lithe allrounder flings down a mixed bag but makes the batters use their feet. The Big Show gets worked for a couple of Small Singles to long on but that’s it. 29th over: Pakistan 105-5 (Rizwan 34, Irfan 2) With the arrival of Khan, Pakistan are into their long tail. Abbott can smell bunnies on the breeze and tightens his line after a couple of hasty yet risky singles from each batter. There’s a half cry on the final delivery. Has he snicked it? Australia seemed confident but Cummins shot a review down fast. Good decision by Captain pat (and the umpire) as Snicko shows nothing but air. 28th over: Pakistan 103-5 (Rizwan 32, Irfan 1 ) As reward for his sharp catch in the last over Matt Short has been given a bowl. He whips through four fizzing deliveries before Rizwan works a single. New batter Irfan Khan gets off the mark from the last ball. Partnership broken! Pakistan were trying to turbo boost the innings and Abbott sensed the moment and threw in an effort ball. It fell short, exploded off the pitch and rushed at Salman’s salivating lips. He swiped at it but didn’t get much timber on it and it chipped up for Matt Short at midwicket. Australia strike for the fifth time. 27th over: Pakistan 101-4 (Rizwan 32, Salman 12) Abbott draws a massive top edge from Rizwan and it’s up, up, up… but safe! That was luck for Pakistan. Wicketkeeper Inglis and the boundary rider Starc hesitated just enough to let the ball drop between them. Pakistan are upping the ante now but it’s high risk cricket. 26th over: Pakistan 96-4 (Rizwan 29, Salman 11) That was an awesome shot by Rizwan off Starc, leaning back to a fast ball and smashing it over the fence. Rizwan has now got himself to 28 at a strike-rate a tick over 50. Not great but Pakistan will take it. He knows Pakistan are halfway through their overs and only a third of the way to a competitive score. Now Salman gets the signal, swatting Adam Zampa behind square for a boundary. Good batting Pakistan! 25th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Rizwan 28, Salman 6) The pickle has worked its magic! Mitchell Starc is back on the field and running in for his eighth over. The crowd are still coming in here at the MCG – tough to judge numbers in so cavernous a stadium but looks a healthy crowd with clumps of support for both sides. Rizwan takes a single through square leg but Rizwan does better – much better! – swiping the final ball for SIX! 24th over: Pakistan 81-4 (Rizwan 21, Salman 4) As Starc takes a slug of pickle pinot gris, Zampa looks fresh as a daisy, flipping and fizzing them at an increasingly befuddled Pakistan. Salman fends off the first three then panics, chipping it to mid-on and attempting a run. He gets halfway down the pitch before Rizwan declines his offer and sends him back. Finally Salman gets his single and Rizwan does too from the last. 23rd over: Pakistan 76-4 (Rizwan 19, Salman 1) Australia are going for the throat – or is that the soft belly of the middle order? They bring back Starc and he delivers a maiden. Although he’s pulled up sore and is now jogging off the field. Hopefully a cramp and not a more serious injury. Will they call for the pickle juice? It’s worked for him before… 22nd over: Pakistan 76-4 (Rizwan 19, Salman 1) Zampa’s threat is such that Rizwan knows he’s got to attack or perish. He slog sweeps two and gets away with it, then sneaks a single. Salman follows suit and Pakistan have four runs from the over. That’s better for the visitors nearing the halfway point of this innings. 21st over: Pakistan 72-4 (Rizwan 16, Salman 0) Cummins turns the screws on Pakistan. Rizwan scampers a single but Salman can’t find a run for the rest of the over. The Australian skipper has 28-1 from his seven overs so far, with one miserly maiden. 20th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Rizwan 15, Salman 0) Zampa bowls a masterly maiden to the new batter Salman Agha. 19th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Rizwan 11, Salman 0) That was superb bowling by Cummins and after lulling Pakistan into confidence by giving them three easy singles, he pulled out a grenade on the last and got his team a wicket with a perfectly-directed bouncer. Cummins strikes! This time it’s the new batter Kamran Ghulam who has 11 brothers and six sisters and came out batting like a man who fought for everything he’s got. But he was too boisterous, and Cummins pushed him onto the back foot with a bouncer and Ghulam flinched and fended, succeeding only in gloving it to Inglis. Pakistan in trouble! 18th over: Pakistan 67-3 (Rizwan 11, Kamran 4) The lethal leggie enters this game with 177 wickets from his 103 ODIs and he struck with his first over. Great bowling by Zampa and smart captaincy by Cummins to bring him in with the game in the balance. New batter is Kamran Ghulam and he dances down the wicket to his second delivery and spiflicates Zampa down the ground past mid-off for a sweet boundary. Come in spinner! Adam Zampa strikes with the fourth ball of his first over! Having puffed and primped his blonde mullet to perfection, Zampa deceives the dangerman Babar who thought he was getting a conventional leg spinner and instead got a flipper. It skidded straight through his defences and snuck under the bat to take his off-stump. 17th over: Pakistan 62-2 (Rizwan 11, Babar 37) Pat Cummins has had a drink and, feeling revived, returned himself to the attack. Rizwan drives the first ball unconvincingly down the ground and gets a single. Babar fends the second delivery into slips but can’t split them. He goes squarer to the fourth Cummins ball and does better, running an easy single. Cummins sprays a full toss at him and Rizwan is too shocked to punish it. Instead he works the final ball through a now-vacant cordon for a single to keep strike. 16th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Rizwan 9, Babar 36) Abbott enters his fourth over in his 25th ODI for Australia. Since debuting for New South Wales at the age of 18 and winning the Steve Waugh Medal as NSW player of the season with 27 wickets, Abbott has struggled a to reach his potential. Babar knows it too. Having watched Abbott fumble a couple of balls in the outfield, he applies even more pressure on the 32-year-old with a thumping square cut over backward point. That’s a much-needed boundary for Pakistan. 15th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Rizwan 7, Babar 31) Hardie has started well here, zeroing in on a nagging length and hitting it consistently. He leaks two singles but Australia remain on top at the MCG. 14th over: Pakistan 49-2 (Rizwan 6, Babar 30) Babar is leading the Pakistan comeback after the loss of those two early wickets. But the going is tough. Australia have bowled tight lines and Rizwan, normally a dasher, has only five from 20 and is still struggling to find his touch. They eke a single from the final ball of Abbott’s third over but the run rate is running at a trickle and stands at just over three-per-over. 13th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Rizwan 5, Babar 29) Starc is off and Aaron Hardie is on for Australia. Hardie is a big man, standing over 190cm and as broad as he is tall. Bowls a good wobble seam does Hardie. He beats Babar with it on his second delivery but Babar hits back with the next ball, flicking Hardie off the pads for a fast-run two. Hardie was born in the UK but grew up in Western Australia and has clearly adopted the diet preferred by Cameron Green and Mitchell Marsh. This is the big unit’s ninth ODI for his country and his first over today is a good one, just two from it. 12th over: Pakistan 45-2 (Rizwan 5, Babar 27) Sean Abbott is into his second over after leaking three runs from his first. Big appeal to the second delivery! Did it catch the edge? Abbott seems confident but Australia’s close fielders think not and there’s no review. Abbott is into the mid-130kph range but Babar works him through deep square for a single to retain strike. 11th over: Pakistan 43-2 (Rizwan 4, Babar 26) Starc is back for another and Rizwan then Babar takes him for singles. They do it again from the next two deliveries. Finally, having done it in singles from fopur hots, Babar achieves the same dividend with a single shot, pulling a short ball through midwicket. Beautiful shot! 10th over: Pakistan 35-2 (Rizwan 2, Babar 20) Here’s the bowling change we forecast: Sean Abbott replaces Pat Cummins and he’s bowling to Rizwan who is still on zero. And it’s almost a runout! The ball was full outside off, drives to cover and Babar took off despite the fielder being Marnus Labuschagne. He lunges and loops the ball at the stumps but misses as Rizwan dives. A direct hit would have had him there. Finally Rizwan gets off the mark with a weird slice that squeaks into covers for two. 9th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 19) Starc is into his fifth over now. His pace is rising and he has two wickets in his kitbag so the big man’s superb record against Pakistan is continuing today. He has new batter Rizwan on strike and thumps it into his gloves. Starc puts the next one wide. He knows Rizwan hasn’t scored from seven balls so far and is trying to tempt a wild slash. No dice this time but it’s another Starc maiden. 8th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 19) Babar cracks Cummins for four! Great shot by Pakistan’s 117-ODI veteran. Captain Pat might have to consider taking a breather here. He went for 10 off his last over and now he’s been spanked through midwicket with vim. Pat gets his radar right on the next few but goes short and straight on the final throw of the dice and Babar steps out to smack it down the ground. Another four! 7th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 11) Starc’s first ball is full but a tad wide of off stump and Abdullah meets it on the up, driving handsomely. Abbott manages to collar that one but Pakistan steal another two runs. Starc’s wicket with his fourth ball has brought Mohammad Rizwan to the crease and he sees off the final two deliveries. Short and sweet from Starc! He pitched it up at Shafique who had battled to 12 from 26 balls. The batter tried to get out of the ball’s path but dropped his hands too late and it clipped the top edge on the way through and Inglis pouched an easy chance. 6th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Abdullah 10, Babar 11) Another misfield from Abbott! Babar drove Cummins into the offside and Abbott slid to meet it on the bounce but lost sight of it somehow and Babar ran two when he should’ve been reduced to a single. Now Babar slides one to fine leg for a single. Now Cummin s drops short to Abdullah Shafique and BANG! He rocks back and bashes it down the ground for Pakistan’s first boundary of the day. Grteat counter attack from Pakistan. And now they show finesse, Abdullah clipping off his ankles to steal another two runs through midwicket. A single from the last gives Pakiustan a 10-run over and Pat Cummins plenty of food for thought. 5th over: Pakistan 12-1 (Abdullah 3, Babar 8) Babar lashes at that one! Great statement of intent from the Pakistani pulveriser. Only a finger flung to the right prevented a boundary on that occasion. He gets two runs from Starc. And now Abdullah runs a fast – and risky – single. For once, Cummins is imperfect, a wild throw negating any chance of a runout. Babar is back from a couple of weeks off. He’s been playing golf and, judging from that first shot of the over, has brought his long irons to the MCG today. He drives at Starc’s final delivery and draws a misfield from Sean Abbott. Three runs. 4th over: Pakistan 5-1 (Abdullah 2, Babar 2) Here is Cummins, bustling to the crease. Babar Azam came to the middle after the loss of Ayub and immediately spanked neat two from Starc to draw even with Abdullah. The Pakistan batters can’t do better in this over, with Cummins bang on target straight away. It’s a maiden. Starc strikes. That ball was fuller and faster and Ayub pushed forward and got a thick and ugly inside edge into the stumps.First blood to the home side! It was a tentative shot from the young opener, normally an attacking batter, but nerves got the better of him on that occasion and Australia have their first scalp of the match. 3rd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Ayub 1, Shafique 2) Starc returns. His first over tickled the speed gun at 136kph but there’s a deeper bend to the back this over. Ayub leaves the first few alone, keen to build a big innings and see off the Australian assassin… 2nd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Ayub 1, Shafique 2) Saim Ayub now has the strike to Australia’s captain Pat Cummins and he gets some bat on the first delivery, not much but enough to run a single. Pakistan are off the mark and so is Ayub. Now Shafique gets off his duck with a strong punch through point. Glenn Maxwell retrieves it in the outfield. Now Cummins the conjuror appears! His fourth ball is a beauty, just back of a length and it whizzes past the edge of Shafique’s flailing blade. Good comeback by the skipper. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Saim 0, Shafique 0) Abdullah Shafique has survives the first couple of deliveries and already Starc has extracted a slight hint of swing back into the right-handed batter. Third ball is a fat full-pitched yorker on the offside and Shafique has a swish at it but is beaten for pace. He can’t get near the fifth and dead bats the final delivery. A maiden to get us started Mitchell Starc has the new ball and we are about to get under way with the first ball of the Australian international summer… Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is delivering a gentle and generous Welcome to Country to the teams and a small but vibrant MCG crowd. Melbourne is smack bang in the middle of its Spring racing carnival and many locals have taken today off work for the Melbourne Cup, “the race that stops a nation”. Famously, American author Mark Twain, attended the Cup in 1895, and wrote: “The grandstands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, a delirium of colour, a vision of beauty. The champagne flows, everybody is vivacious, excited, happy.” • This post was amended on 13 November 2024. Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is a Wurundjeri elder, not a Wiradjuri elder as an earlier version said. That means we’ll have to wait for the fireworks from young master Fraser-McGurk and we’ll have to content ourselves with the greatest fast bowling cartel in the cricket world. Players are taking the field at the MCG and we’ll have the first ball soon. Pakistan have long been an unpredictable cricket team and few predicted their Test series win over England last month. Having run up a first innings total in excess of 500, they looked primed for victory yet spectacularly capitulated to lose the first Test by an innings. Yet, under the calm resolute leadership of Gillespie, they fought back to win the next two Tests. Here’s how James Wallace made sense of such madness… Regardless of who wins the toss, many cricket fans will be hoping to see Australia’s 22-year-old batting superstar Jake Fraser-McGurk unleashed. Despite being the new coach of Pakistan, Jason Gillespie is a beloved figure in Australian cricket. The great-grandson of a Kamilaroi warrior, “Dizzy” is recognised as our first male Indigenous Test cricketer. Sydney-born and Adelaide-raised, Gillespie’s celebrated 71-Test career produced 259 wickets plus another 142 scalps from his 97 ODIs. With his glorious mullet, magnificent moustache and a fast-bowler’s sneer that could curdle a batter’s bone marrow at 10 paces, he was a dream to watch and a nightmare to face. Curiously, Gillespie’s most famous moment came with the bat: his maiden Test century was a scarcely-believable unbeaten 201 in Bangladesh – the highest score in history by a nightwatchman and an innings compiled over 574 minutes and 425 balls. Mohammad Hasnain might be familiar to a few Australians. The beanpole quick with the lightning right-arm was first sighted on these shores in 2019 when he made his ODI debut as an 18-year-old. Back then he was regularly nudging the speed gun at 150kph but injuries have derailed his career and cut into that express speed. Five years later he makes a welcome return as a 24-year-old for a 10th white-ball match for Pakistan. Hasnain looked pretty good in MCG nets on Saturday as he rolled in under the watchful eye of Pakistan’s new Australian coach, Jason Gillespie… Greetings cricket fans! Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the first men’s one-day international between Australia and Pakistan. This is game one of a three-match series and today’s action is coming to you from the Melbourne Cricket Ground. I’m Angus Fontaine and I’ll be steering you through the first fusillades of action. Although these countries met in January for a Test series won by Australia 3-0, it’s been more than a year since they last crossed swords in the ODI format. That clash was at the 2023 World Cup clash in Bengaluru and Australia won by a 62-runs after a memorably mammoth opening stand of 259-runs between David Warner and Mitchell Marsh. Much to Pakistan’s relief, neither of those veterans will be in the Australian squad today. Warner has retired at last and Marsh is on ice (ie. paternity leave) for the upcoming Test series against India where he will have to shoulder the bowling load of the injured Cameron Green. With master blaster Travis Head also enjoying the flush of fatherhood, it will be Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk opening for the men in gold. Pat Cummins returns as captain for Australia for this series and leads a formidable XI of Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Steve Smith, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Aaron Hardie, Glenn Maxwell, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa. Pakistan are fresh from a stirring Test series victory over England in England and have a new white-ball captain in Mohammad Rizwan, the 32-year-old from Peshawar in his 73rd ODI for Pakistan. They also have some new blood in their matchday XI with batter Muhammad Irfan Khan to debut and Kamran Ghulam to play his second ODI. Their four-man pace attack shapes as Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and the two-metre tall Mohammad Hasnain, who has been clocked at 155.1 kph! Australia is experiencing a late-Spring heatwave so we have a warm, cloudy day in Melbourne and a clear forecast for this evening’s day-nighter. Play gets under way at 2.30pm AEST and you’re free to shoot me on email at any stage with interesting stats and stories, words of encouragement or clarifications for any errors as I clatter away. Until then batten ‘em down and buckle ‘em up because the action isn’t far away."

          "bodyText": "Verdi: Falstaff - Finale Apologies to Mozartians, who might claim that The Marriage of Figaro has the most uplifting finale in the operatic repertory, but the final fugue in Verdi’s last opera wins the prize. It’s not just the idea of ending a score already larded with parodies and allusions with the most academic of musical forms, or its astounding compositional virtuosity – 10 independent voices at one point – but its irresistible outpouring of joyous energy. “Tutto nel mondo è burla” (Life is a burst of laughter) indeed. Andrew Clements Stravinsky: Petrushka Stravinsky wrote three game-changing ballets early in his career and I could have chosen any of them, but the opening of Petrushka gets the heart racing like nothing else. It’s an almost cinematic follow-shot, as Stravinsky whirls us through the crowded fair where the story takes place in an exhilarating sequence of clashing tempos and keys and textures – music that picks you up without warning, whirls you round before you can catch your breath, and drops you back down again facing something new. Erica Jeal John Adams: Short Ride in a Fast Machine It’s the woodblock that does it: setting a pace that instantly raises your heart rate. Trumpets add their gleam to the pulse. Woodwind and synths bubble in maximalist splashes of colour. The strings launch a rhythmic lick that drives against the original beat. The texture becomes denser, its gears changing constantly. Every shift brings another injection of brash, joyous energy. John Adams’ 1986 orchestral fanfare is four minutes of classical thrill-seeking – a shot of adrenaline for tired ears. Flora Willson Bernstein: Candide Overture Explosive, restless, with brassy outbursts, taut rhythms and soaring tunes, the overture to Bernstein’s Voltaire-based operetta is a short, dazzling punch of energy. Save the story for another day and follow Bernstein’s assertion that music is about movement, always going somewhere, shifting and changing, flowing, from one note to another and that “movement can tell us more about the way we feel than a million words can”. Listen. Sit still if you can. You won’t. Fiona Maddocks Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit Quiet music is not synonymous with relaxing music. Maurice Ravel’s three movement 1908 piano suite exemplifies this. In Ravel’s hands, quiet is tense, expectant, even menacing. Each piece in Gaspard begins quietly but is packed with suspense. Ondine ripples like the water into which the nymph drags her victims. In Le Gibet, ghostly phrases circle a continuously tolling B flat, as a body sways on the gallows. And in Scarbo, quiet tremolos explode into terrifying darkness. There is not a bar in Ravel’s score that does not ask: what comes next? You don’t dare relax for a second. Martin Kettle Strauss: Elektra Opera’s ability to probe, often unflinchingly, human emotion at its most complex and profound has long made it the musical form I love the most. And nothing quite embodies the extremes to which it can take us like Strauss’s Elektra, which refashions Greek tragedy along psychodramatic lines in a score by turns terrifying, moving and exalting, which also explores the limits that singers and orchestra can achieve in performance. A tremendous, shattering work, to which I always return, again and again. Tim Ashley Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1, Op.15 As one who has a real aversion to the promotion of classical music as an unwinding fix, my recommendation is a work which is stimulating and endlessly engaging: Brahms’s First Piano Concerto. Stephen Hough has described its opening as “a clap of D minor thunder” and its stormy emotional charge is guaranteed to send the brain neurons into instant action potential signalling. The interplay of soloist and orchestra carries a vital force throughout, its logic simply exhilarating. Rian Evans Mendelssohn: Octet in E flat for Strings Can there be anyone who does not feel their heart lifted as they listen to the opening movement of this octet? Scored for a double string quartet, it’s a work of glorious verve and energy written by the prodigiously talented young composer when he was only 16. I too was 16 when I first encountered it – dragged along to a classical concert by my father – and I was transfixed by its sparkle and optimism and the sheer joy it brought to the musicians performing that evening. It’s probably no exaggeration to say it changed my life. Imogen Tilden"

          "bodyText": "Once fresh-faced new kids on the block, now more like a favourite uncle and aunt, Yo-Yo Ma and Kathryn Stott have been making sweet music together for 40 years. A cause for celebration, yes, but there was sadness in the air tonight too, as the British pianist has decided to hang up her hat as a performing musician. This handsomely curated programme was by way of her final hurrah. At the heart of the matter were two of the great cello sonatas: Shostakovich’s neurasthenic outpouring from 1934 and Franck’s fully sanctioned arrangement of his hyper-romantic A major violin sonata from 1888. Both works demonstrated the performers’ instinctual and intimate way of working together, each tilted slightly back, their heads almost touching. Ma’s burnished timbre brought an intense beauty to the Shostakovich, his effortless legato probing the Largo to bring out its feeling of infinite sorrow. Stott’s meaty tone and insistent rhythms drove the demonic Allegro, its sinister mood heightened by Ma’s skeletal glissandi. Urgent, and occasionally exuberant, this was classy playing of the highest order. The Franck, too, was a thing of wonder, the musicians’ flexible approach calm and expansive, with plenty of firepower held in reserve. Stott, in particular, took no prisoners, executing some ferociously demanding leaps and runs. From brooding dales to sunny uplands, synchronicity and balance were immaculate, as was the palpable sense of unanimity of purpose. There were bon bons to open, including Fauré’s Berceuse, tastefully understated. Ma’s phrasing was exquisite, Stott’s touch soft as a featherbed. A rapt account of Nadia Boulanger’s Cantique proved a fitting tribute to the great French pedagogue who was one of Stott’s first mentors as well as the teacher of Ma’s college professor (she also taught Aaron Copland, Philip Glass and Burt Bacharach). Most remarkable was their playing of Arvo Pärt’s Spiegel im Spiegel. Barely rising above a pianissimo, Ma’s ethereal phrasing and Stott’s measured cascade of notes created a meditative bubble so fragile that no one dared applaud at the end for fear it might burst. A fitting tribute to one of classical music’s most enduring and endearing partnerships."

          "bodyText": "There could be recriminations, protest marches and even social unrest on US city streets when Federal Reserve officials meet at their Washington HQ a day after the election of a new president on 5 November. The election of Kamala Harris could bring supporters of Donald Trump on to the streets, while a victory for Trump could provoke widespread anger and condemnation among Democrats. The Fed is supposed to behave as if it lives outside the political bubble, away from the daily jousting in Congress and the White House. An era-defining election will be more difficult to ignore. Nevertheless, the Fed is expected to please whoever wins by cutting interest rates and signalling several more reductions, after figures showed a two-year battle against inflation had been largely won in the summer. Markets currently expect Fed boss Jerome Powell to announce a 0.25-percentage-point reduction in interest rates, to a spread between 4.5% and 4.75%, at a press conference on 7 November. There are doubts among some Fed officials about whether the defeat of inflation has been permanent and lasting. They worry that businesses will jack up prices by more than the Fed’s 2% annual inflation target in response to a tight labour market that has kept wage increases steady even as inflation has fallen. However, the most recent jobs data showed the unemployment rate rising from 3.4% to 4.1% over the last 18 months, after hitting 4.3% in July. The closely watched non-farm payroll report on Friday showed the US economy had added just 12,000 jobs in October. That was well below expectations for 113,000. There were special factors at play – the impacts of hurricanes Helene and Milton both affected the month, and a strike at Boeing also had an effect. But even so, analysts were aware of these factors when making their forecasts. The weak data means that a larger 0.5-percentage-point reduction in the cost of borrowing is possible. A bigger cut would be welcomed by most US workers, whose wage increases have yet to reverse a noticeable slide in living standards. British workers are similarly hard-pressed and looking forward to a rate cut by the Bank of England to ease mortgage and rental costs. Policymakers at the Bank’s Threadneedle Street HQ also meet on 6 November and, like Fed officials, deliver their verdict on 7 November. There is a strong chance the Bank will cut interest rates after governor Andrew Bailey told the Guardian that it could become a “bit more aggressive” in doing so if inflation continued to cool. That was before the latest official figures showed UK inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September – below the Bank’s 2% target and the lowest level in three and a half years. The Bank will have a big advantage over the Fed, and that relates to the political backdrop for its decisions. While the Fed will be in the dark about the tax and spending policies of the incoming president, Labour’s budget last week gives the Bank a good view of the government’s finances five years ahead. By some measures, the budget restricts government spending, giving Bailey and his colleagues room to cut rates at a faster pace. The only cross-current comes from investment spending, which Rachel Reeves said would rise substantially after relaxing government borrowing rules. A dash for growth could put pressure on prices if it leads to a jump in demand for skilled workers, and those workers demand higher pay in a bidding war between employers. This scenario may mean the Bank judges that rates need to stay higher for longer. Yet investment is likely only to rise slowly, whatever ministers say about the urgency – allowing inflation to remain low, wages to increase only modestly and interest rates to continue on their downward path. It follows that, on both sides of the Atlantic, these two economies could be running neither too hot or too cold in a year’s time, having regained their sense of balance after a disorientating period of rocketing inflation. The only blot on the landscape is the US election, which could wreck this careful choreography. A disputed result, or a Trump victory, will probably send markets into a spin, upsetting the return to something like normality."

          "headline": "‘I’m done’: Joe Marler retires from international rugby to focus on family",
          "bodyText": "Joe Marler has called time on his England career and will play no part in the rest of their autumn internationals campaign, citing the need to prioritise his family. Marler, who whipped up a storm last week with his comments criticising the haka, announced his decision on Sunday, conceding: “I can’t do what I used to do as well as I once could.” The Sale loosehead prop Asher Opoku-Fordjour has been added to the England squad preparing for the match on Saturday against Australia. It is a first call-up for the highly rated Opoku-Fordjour, who can play on both sides of the scrum and was part of the England under‑20s side who won the World Cup over the summer. As revealed exclusively by the Guardian, Marler left the England camp at the start of last week, citing personal reasons, and made himself unavailable for the defeat against the All Blacks on Saturday. It is understood Marler arrived in camp last Sunday but told Steve Borthwick, the England head coach, and a group of senior players of his decision and returned to his family home. While he was keen to stress last week that he was taking a “day‑by‑day” approach, the writing was on the wall when Marler left camp and he brings the curtain down on his England career with 95 caps. Marler was at Twickenham on Saturday and was seen joking with the New Zealand head coach, Scott Robertson, after stoking the fire in the buildup with his claim that the haka should be “binned”. He later apologised, having clarified his view that opponents should be allowed to challenge the haka. “Playing for England always felt like I was living in a dream bubble,” Marler, who will continue to play for Harlequins, wrote on social media. “I kept waiting for it to pop and me to suddenly go back to being a gobby, overweight 16-year-old again. But you know when it’s time. “I can’t do what I used to do as well as I once could. I can’t keep talking about my family being my priority unless they actually are. I want to keep it untarnished, all these memories of my career, both good and bad. I don’t want to leave my house with my kids crying. I’m ready to make the change. “The first teammate I told was Dan Cole. We were sharing a room at the England hotel. I hugged him, he hugged me. The conversation went a bit like this: I love you mate. I love you too. What’s up? I’m done, mate. I know you are.” Marler has retired previously from international rugby, in 2018, only to reverse his decision in time for the 2019 World Cup, but at 34 another change of heart is unlikely. He has four children with his wife, Daisy, and has spoken candidly about his struggles with spending long periods in camp away from his family. In 2016 he withdrew from the summer tour of Australia and though he was talked into making himself available for the World Cup last year by Borthwick, having previously not appeared for England since the 2022 Six Nations, it was clear he took some convincing. While Marler accepted a place in Borthwick’s squad for the Autumn Nations Series and took part in the warm-weather training camp in Girona, a well-placed source has pointed to how Marler has had to battle back from a broken foot to regain fitness last month as well as how he has fallen down the England pecking order with Ellis Genge fit again after missing the summer tour and his Harlequins teammate Fin Baxter emerging on to the scene. As a result, Marler realised his heart was no longer in it. “I’m incredibly grateful that I got to play 95 times for my country,” Marler said. “I have to pinch myself. Did I really do that? I’m grateful to all those people who showed patience as I kept messing up. I’m grateful to the fans who made each match special. I’m grateful to the teammates who pushed alongside or behind me, and the ones who could do all the things with the ball that I can’t. But most of all I’m grateful to Daisy, Jasper, Maggie, Felix and Pixie for the unwavering support. “I’m sad to say goodbye to international rugby. But, I’m really proud, too. Time to exit one dream bubble; time to enter a new one. Big Love x.” Marler’s retirement is a setback for Borthwick. It is understood he was sympathetic to the decision last week but after the defeat by the All Blacks he sought to blame the inexperience of his current squad. Of the 2023 World Cup squad, Courtney Lawes, Owen Farrell, Ben Youngs, Jonny May, Manu Tuilagi, Billy Vunipola and now Marler have all either retired or made themselves unavailable for selection. “Joe has been an outstanding servant to English rugby – a tough, uncompromising competitor on the field, and a genuine, one-of-a-kind personality off it,” Borthwick said."

          "bodyText": "I’m totally off my face,” cries sound-healer Debbi Walker. It’s 11.45am and she’s just finished bathing me in a cacophony of twinkling sounds reminiscent of something Tinkerbell would appear to. (I had tried to focus on connecting with my “inner wisdom”, but my ears instead tune into a woman outside the tent talking about the amount of crystals hidden in her underwear drawer.) I’m part of a group experiencing the gentle tap of metal pipes and tuning forks around our heads, while we sway and rock to the vibrations. Debbi, who has curly silver hair flowing down to her waist, looks like an ethereal goddess as she dances between us in a floor-length grey corseted dress. I’m encouraged to hold hands with strangers as we hum in various pitches (mine mainly out of tune) and whisper blessings such as “love” and “gratitude” into a sound-healing bowl. I’m here for the annual 3 Wishes Fairy Festival, a gathering “nestling on a leyline” in Glastonbury full of folk music, folklore and those who believe in magic. Earlier in the day, while picking up my morning coffee, an elf beside me ordered “pancakes and strawberries with fairy dust on top, please.” Neon pink glitter blew past as he carried it away. More than 1,500 people attend this quirky event over three days. Karen Kay, the founder, claims to be “half fairy, half mermaid and half human” and has put fairies into the mainstream; she believes in them so much that she left her job as a BBC news editor to do this full-time. While the event is family-friendly, this is not to be mistaken as a children’s festival and mainly adults attend. The event describes itself as a “gathering of the Celtic faerie clans”. In 2018, they broke the world record for the most people wearing unicorn horns in a single location. There are no rules other than “be nice”. “It’s about spreading love, light and joy into the world,” explains Kay. Before Debbi Walker became a sound therapist, her background was in NHS nursing, “but the job made me very sick,” she explains, adding that she was housebound with chronic fatigue syndrome. But then, “I found sound at a festival in 2010 and it changed my life.” She acknowledges that it took a while for her science brain to come around but, after doing a clinical trial about how sound helps mental health, she left nursing to teach sound healing full-time. “We were in a beautiful sacred sound bubble just now, it is a bit hippy and airy-fairy, but I marry this with the world of science,” she says. Before we part ways, I offer to join her for a drink later. “I don’t drink,” she replies and it takes me a few seconds to realise she wasn’t “off her face” in the way I’d interpreted earlier. She was, instead, drunk on the healing energy and positive effects of the atmosphere around her. After pulling me and the Observer photographer into a group hug, Debbi disappears into a sea of bubbles and fairy wings, leaving me to move on to a spot of enchanted wand-making, where I am allowed to go feral with beads and ribbon. Afterwards, I make my way through the crowd with my new creation, past Alice in Wonderland-style picnic tables, wooden structures not dissimilar to what you’d find in an enchanted forest and picnic blankets full of teacups and crockery. There are stalls filled with crystals, windchimes, fairy houses and flower crowns. Fairy wings caress my face as I come upon a man covered in bark, mushrooms and animal skulls. He proudly introduces himself as “the King of the Pixies” and suddenly I am all too aware of how “human” I look. I ask him what it means to be King of the Pixies, excited to hear what being royalty in the magical realm entails. But he replies: “Erm, I don’t know really, I’ve not got anything to say on that.” Determined to find out more about what identifying as a magical being means, I make my way to the Mermaid Lagoon. The water (a paddling pool) has been blessed with a spell and Cornish sea salt. Mischief, a 44-year-old professional mermaid, is also an SSI Ocean Mermaid free-dive instructor. “If people are trying to work out whether mermaids are real or not, they are wasting their time,” she tells me. “Too much of our water is undiscovered to ever know, it’s safe from the infection of human impact. Mermaids are an example of the freedom of the ocean. Humans need to start respecting the ocean more… when a mermaid is born, it’s about empowerment and a need to put some mermagic into this world. This magic shows us the way to protect our seas and our mental health,” Mischief explains. “Everyone at this festival has a wish to believe in the energy and power of this amazing world and its creatures, everyone is acknowledging how lucky we are.” She hands me a shell with her email address written on it in Sharpie before continuing, “being a mermaid has helped me focus on what’s important, that living is a gift and we shouldn’t waste a moment, I share this because everyone deserves to know how magical they are.” Next I talk to River Jordan, who has been in the fairy community her whole life. “I’ve always been drawn to the elements and anything mystical,” she explains in a soft and playful voice. We are constantly interrupted by children running up to her, desperate for an embrace from a fairy queen. “I wanted to be a mermaid when I grew up, people always told me it wasn’t possible – but it is,” she insists, adding: “Don’t let anyone tell you that you have to grow up.” In 2021, River was diagnosed with stage 3 inflammatory breast cancer. Three months after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and one mastectomy, she discovered another lump and had to go through it again. “All in all, I’ve had 24 rounds of chemotherapy, 15 rounds of radiotherapy, three mastectomies – because one went wrong – and a partridge in a pear tree,” she bows. “What I love about fairy imagery, is that they are often breastless or nippleless and their faces can be gnarly and different. When I go into nature there is no judgment, in this world, people look different and fairies help me find love and self-acceptance.” Embracing differences is something that is instantly apparent throughout the entire festival. Not only is it fully plant-based, it is sure to make all feel welcome, with safe spaces and full access for disabled guests. After being attracted to a circus tent, I stick my head inside and glimpse a woman wrapped in silks hanging from the roof above someone dressed as a giant panda, and decide to make my way to what I hope will be the relatively uncomplicated market stalls. I inspect some elf ears and, before I know it, my own ears are soon replaced with pointed elf tips. “They suit you more than I’ve ever seen on anyone,” the stall-holder exclaims excitedly, thrusting a mirror into my hands. As I continue on my way an elderly lady drifts past and wisely smiles before saying, “You’ve acquired ears I see.” Other people greet me with smiles and compliments on my ears and encourage me to visit other stalls to build my elf character with more props and accessories. A cacao ceremony – based on ancient Aztec and Mayan traditions to promote healing and self-exploration – is scheduled for 6pm, so I make my way to the stand for a little tester drink. On my way I pass two people dressed as unicorns and someone on a penny farthing. A lot of the ceremony that I witness uses phrases like “the divine masculine” and the “divine feminine”, while instruments I can’t even begin to guess the name of are played. The cacao was delicious, but I wasn’t as moved by the ceremony as others seemed to be. While people vehemently sway with their eyes closed and hands in front of their faces, I creep out, too buzzed from the cacao to concentrate on listening and, instead, make my way to the face-paint tent. By 11pm, my face is painted with witch-like symbols, my elf ears are pointing out of a fully beaded cowboy hat and I have two long neon pink and orange wool dreadlocks plaited into my hair. I’ve bopped to the beats of Fatboy Tim (no that isn’t a typo) and danced with a green-horned troll. A German fairy has spun me round, giggling and flicking her hair before planting a labradorite ring on my finger and running away. When I find organiser Karen Kay again, she engulfs me with hugs, shouting: “You’ve been fairy-fied!” While I might not believe in fairies, I certainly believe in the power a wonderful community like this has to lift your spirits. Although adults dressing as fairies might be misunderstood to those who aren’t in the subculture, their warmth, easy welcome and acceptance of those who are different showcase what’s often missing from the world. For the first time in weeks, my cheeks hurt from smiling. In an overwhelming year full of darkness and stress, blowing bubbles with fairies might not be top of your list, but don’t be surprised if you find it’s exactly the kind of weekend you didn’t know you needed. • This article was amended on 4 November 2024. In an earlier version the caption accompanying the photo of River Jordan said, “I’ve bopped to the beats of Fatboy Tim and danced with a green-horned troll”. To clarify, these were the words of the article’s author, writing about the festival; they have been replaced to refer directly to River Jordan."

          "headline": "A ripping yarn: Olympian Tom Daley opens knitting exhibition in Japan",
          "bodyText": "Tom Daley’s legions of fans will for ever remember the Tokyo Olympics as the backdrop to his first gold medal, secured with Matty Lee with a flawless final dive in the men’s 10metre synchronised platform. But the Tokyo Games, delayed by a year owing to the coronavirus pandemic, also marked Daley’s debut as an equally accomplished knitter and crocheter – a hitherto semi-hidden side to his life that continued through to his valedictory, silver medal-winning appearance in Paris this summer, and now into retirement. No one was more surprised than the man himself by the reaction to the sight of Daley, seated on a blue plastic seat in the near-empty Tokyo Aquatics Centre, painstakingly creating what would become his personal tribute to the host city. In a way, that white cardigan, embellished with the union flag, the Team GB logo and the Olympic rings, the kanji characters for “Tokyo” embroidered on the front, was symbolic of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Games. Spectators were banned from all but a handful of venues, including the main stadium, while daily medal counts were accompanied by a running total of new Covid-19 infections in the Olympic village – the only neighbourhood in the city athletes were permitted to set foot in when they weren’t competing. Knitting, Daley explained after the images of him mid-purl went viral, had been a distraction from the intense pressure of competition, and from the tedium of life in the pandemic-hit Games bubble. Three years later, Daley is poised to revisit the city that cemented his association with yarn in the minds of the public, with his first knitted art exhibition, at Parco Museum Tokyo in the Japanese capital’s Shibuya district. The event, that runs for 18 days from 8-25 November and with Daley in attendance on the opening day to give a live knitting workshop, will include personally selected pieces under the theme Made With Love – also the name given to his range of yarns and an Instagram account that has traced his second career in wool since it began a year before the Tokyo Olympics. “I’d been knitting since March 2020, but no one really cared until they saw me do it at the Olympics,” Daley told the Guardian from his home in California, where he lives with his husband, the film-maker Dustin Lance Black, and their two young children. “I think some people thought I didn’t care about the Olympics, that I was just knitting. Some people thought it was brave to be knitting in public, and some thought: ‘What the hell is he doing?’” It’s reasonable to assume that the number of yarn threads in one of his medal pouches now vastly outnumbers the sceptics. While his famous cardigan was taking shape, Daley won a gold medal – only Britain’s second Olympic gold in the sport – in Tokyo, and three years later added to his haul of one gold and three bronzes with silver in Paris, again in the men’s 10m synchronised platform. “I’m so excited about the exhibition,” Daley said, seated in front of shelves of colourful yarn. “It’s been a long time in the works now – over a year. I’ve been working on designs and ideas I wanted to portray. It’s the first time I’ve done anything like this and I feel like it’s really fitting to do it in Japan and Tokyo, which is where the fascination with my knitting began.” The exhibition’s organisers have promised an immersive experience – a journey through a range of emotions, heightened by the use of light and music, and drawing on the now inseparable aesthetic and athletic components that make up Daley’s public persona. It will include his knitted works, photographs, interactive art installations, as well as personal videos featuring knitting tutorials. “In our first meeting, what came through is that he’s doing this for all the right reasons,” Shai Ohayon, a Tokyo-based British curator who organised the exhibition, said. “He’s humble and thoughtful about what he’s doing.” Ohayon added that the exhibition would revolve around community and the calming effect imparted by a pair of knitting needles and a ball of wool. Daley used knitting “as my way of being able to switch off from everything that was going on, being able to just focus on something that was right in front of me at that moment. That was quite powerful, so when I was photographed [making his cardigan] I didn’t really think about it because there was no one in the stands in Tokyo. “The next day I woke up and had another million followers on Instagram, and I thought: ‘What on earth has happened?’ It was really nice to be able to break the stereotypes of who knitting is for and who should be able to knit … and also knitting in public wasn’t really a thing. It’s a great way to pass the time. You see people reading a book, so why not get out your needles and have something on the go?” Visitors will be invited to knit their own simple pieces, guided by Daley in on-screen tutorials, and either take them home or stick them on a community board at the venue. “I want people to feel really immersed in my knitting brain, so that’s the journey I hope to take people on when they come to the exhibition.” While he ponders a post-diving future that could include media work – as well as expanding his knitting and crocheting business – Daley says preparing for the exhibition has helped ease the transition from the pool to his new life as a knitter, a passion he shares with Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter, the fashion designer Ella Emhoff. Since announcing his retirement at 30, days after the Paris Games, Daley revealed he hasn’t had time to climb on to a diving board. “I’m busy, but in a different way. It’s been great to be able to spend more time with the kids, but then I’ve also been travelling a lot. “It feels very surreal to be done with diving, but I’ll stay involved. I’ll always watch it and hopefully I’ll be able to travel to watch competitions. It’s difficult to get access to a diving pool here, so I haven’t been in one since the Olympics. But I’d like to be able to get to the point where I dive for fun again.” The Tokyo event will also be an opportunity for Daley to continue his campaign for the rights of LGBTQ+ people. Having once said the Olympics should never be awarded to countries that criminalise homosexuality, he had a rethink while filming the 2022 BBC programme Illegal to Be Me. “The most important thing is that LGBTQ+ people can be visible in countries where the laws are against them,” he said. “The more powerful thing is to be able to go to a country that’s hosting a sporting event and just being you and succeeding and doing well. “It’s such a powerful and strong message and sends a message of hope. I think all we can do as LGBTQ+ people is to be visible, to be out there and be ourselves. That in itself is a form of activism. And everyone can get involved in that.” While Japan is home to a thriving LGBTQ+ community, its conservative government has resisted pressure to legalise same-sex marriage, despite polls showing a majority of Japanese support the change. The equality theme will run throughout the Tokyo exhibition, with the proceeds from sales of merchandise and a silent auction of Daley designs going to Marriage for All Japan, an organisation campaigning for same-sex marriage. Daley, who is now taking sewing classes – he had just started on a pair of trousers when he spoke to the Guardian – hopes visitors will leave the Tokyo exhibition “inspired to pick up knitting needles, to try a craft like crocheting, and to just think about the process of slowing down and being mindful about situations. And maybe they’ll be inspired to try diving or another sport … something new and out of your comfort zone. “You never know what it might turn into.”"

Heretic Out now Paddington 2 showcased a PG version of Hugh Grant’s delicious ability to vamp it up as a villain, and here’s the 15 certificate horror version. Grant plays Mr Reed, a sinister man who initially seems welcoming when two young Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) show up on his doorstep. Juror #2 Out now Clint Eastwood is no slouch – at 94 years old, he’s still acting and directing, with this legal thriller being his latest. Nicholas Hoult plays a family man who finds himself confronted by a moral dilemma while serving as juror in a high-profile murder case. Toni Collette also stars (making this her big-screen reunion with Hoult; they played mother and son in About a Boy). Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story Out now This documentary tells the story of how Christopher Reeve donned the Man of Steel’s blue tights and flew into the spotlight, before the accident that saw him evolve into a campaigner and activist in the pursuit of a cure for spinal cord injuries. Catherine Bray * * * Going out: Gigs Pitchfork music festival London Various venues, 5 to 10 November Kae Tempest, Empress Of, Tierra Whack and Sega Bodega are some of the highlights of Pitchfork’s annual trip to London. Spread across numerous venues, the lineup also includes a night curated by mercurial Brit award winner Casisdead. Michael Cragg Ezra Collective 5 to 15 November; tour starts Nottingham In 2023, a joyous mix of jazz, Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime and Latin grooves made Ezra Collective the first band to win the Mercury prize for a jazz album. They launch their new release, Dance, No One’s Watching, with this UK tour, winding up at Wembley Arena. John Fordham Mother Tongue Royal Festival Hall, London, 6 November No doubt it will be the prospect of Vikingur Ólafsson playing Brahms’s First Piano Concerto that will make this concert by Edward Gardner and the London Philharmonic into a hot ticket. But it’s the new work at the centre of the programme, an LPO commission, that’s more intriguing, for recent works by Freya Waley-Cohen have marked her out as a composer with something to say. Expect a world premiere of her latest work, Mother Tongue. Andrew Clements Interpol 2 to 10 November; tour starts Manchester Released in 2004, Interpol’s second album, Antics, afforded the New York miserabilists a seat at rock’s main table, with support slots with U2 and the Cure quickly following. Twenty years later and they’re showcasing its highlights, including the excellent Slow Hands, on this special anniversary tour. MC * * * Going out: Art Julia Margaret Cameron to Eileen Agar: The Hewat Collection Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, to 12 January The powerful photography of Julia Margaret Cameron shines brightly out of the torpor of British Victorian art. Her portrait of the astronomer Sir John Herschel, included in this exhibition, is surely her masterpiece, with Herschel’s Rembrandtesque face surrounded by what seems like a supernova. This show also includes Agar’s surrealism, and works by Cyril Edward Power. Vivienne Westwood The Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, to 2 March From her early splash as an inventor of punk style to her fame as a flamboyant couture designer and posing nude for Juergen Teller, Vivienne Westwood was a truly brilliant cultural star. This show from a private collection also reveals her fascination with the 18th-century rococo. Medieval Women British Library, London, to 2 March Authors, composers, feminists – the women of medieval Europe included famed individuals who broke through the inequalities of a feudal world. Christine de Pizan, author of The City of Women, and Sybille of Flanders, who went on the Crusades, feature here along with evidence of ordinary lives from nunneries to childbirth. Discover Constable and the Hay Wain National Gallery, London, to 2 February The Hay Wain is often dismissed as a patriotic icon but that cliche won’t survive a proper look at the painting. Constable’s knotty colour and texture make this scene as alive as when it was painted. He takes you into the mystery of a moment in memory, under fickle clouds. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage Tatty Macleod 3 to 29 November; tour starts London Britons have an almost masochistic need to laugh at themselves, an impulse Macleod – born in France to British parents – exploits expertly with her Anglo/Franco culture-clash comedy. But she also underpins it with weightier themes, such as the lack of belonging engendered by her cross-Channel background. Rachel Aroesti Guards at the Taj Orange Tree theatre, London, to 16 November Every year the Orange Tree hosts a production by the winner of the JMK award, a prestigious prize for directors. This year’s winner is Adam Karim, directing Rajiv Joseph’s thrilling new tale of beauty and betrayal, as two imperial guards oversee the final day of construction on the Taj Mahal. Kate Wyver Birdsong Chichester festival theatre, 5 to 9 November Rachel Wagstaff’s adaptation brings the heart of Sebastian Faulks’s tale of love and loss to the stage. Trevor Nunn directed it 14 years ago; now Alastair Whatley leads the way. Taking us through the Battle of the Somme as men cling to the memories of their loved ones, this new production marks the extraordinary novel’s 30th anniversary. KW A Christmas Carol Lyceum, Sheffield, 7 to 9 November, then touring Northern Ballet revives one of its hits from the 1990s, created by director Christopher Gable and choreographer Massimo Moricone – the same team behind its Romeo &amp; Juliet, another recent successful revival. A family show with an atmospheric Victorian setting (designed by the brilliant Lez Brotherston) and everyone’s favourite Christmas misery guts. Humbug! Lyndsey Winship * * * Staying in: Streaming The Day of the Jackal Sky Atlantic/Now, 7 November, 9pm After the cutting-edge thrills of Top Boy, writer Ronan Bennett returns with a slightly more old-school crime drama. Based on Frederick Forsyth’s 1971 novel, this nail-biting series stars Eddie Redmayne as a prolific and consummate lone-wolf hitman who is pursued across Europe by Lashana Lynch’s obsessed intelligence officer. Lucan BBC Two/iPlayer, 6 to 8 November, 9pm In 1974, Lord Lucan was accused of murdering his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett. Then he disappeared. Even now, the mystery of his whereabouts looms large in the public imagination, but nobody remains more fixated on the case than builder Nick Berriman; Rivett was his mother. This documentary charts his efforts to find Lucan. Junior Taskmaster Channel 4, 8 November, 8pm The Taskmaster universe just keeps expanding: hot on the heels of the launch of the quirky gameshow’s “live experience” in London comes a kids’ spin-off with a refreshed hosting duo: ex-contestants Rose Matafeo and Mike Wozniak play the merciless taskmaster and her mild-mannered assistant. Citadel: Honey Bunny Prime Video, 7 November The Russo Brothers are best known for their contributions to the Marvel cinematic universe; now they’re bringing that franchise mindset to TV. October brought an Italian spin-off of their spy thriller Citadel; now there’s an Indian version, starring Varun Dhawan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu as a couple whose secret agent past catches up with them. RA * * * Staying in: Games Dragon Age: The Veilguard Out now; PC, PS5, Xbox The former princes/princesses of role-playing games at BioWare have had a rough decade – we are all hoping that this long-anticipated fantasy sequel will be a return to form. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Out 7 November; Nintendo Switch Join the plumber brothers on a ship in this island-hopping comic, book-styled comedy adventure. It looks cute but it’s also got some story and turn-based combat chops. Keza MacDonald * * * Staying in: Albums Mxmtoon – Liminal Space Out now Mxmtoon, AKA 24-year-old Californian Maia, first released songs anonymously in 2017, but her fanbase grew too big to keep things secret. Seven years later and the streamer, podcaster and graphic novelist is on her third album, which features the country-ish strut of single I Hate Texas. The Cure – Songs of a Lost World Out now The enduring goth legends, led by Robert Smith, first confirmed the existence of this 14th album, their first since 2008, via a series of postcards sent to fans back in September. These followed the premiere of five typically bleak but melodic new songs while on tour in 2022. All that teasing finally comes to an end now. Mount Eerie – Night Palace Out now Phil Elverum, purveyor of heart-aching lo-fi folk experiments, returns to his Mount Eerie moniker for this follow-up to 2019’s Lost Wisdom Pt 2. The storm-lashed I Walk features a swirl of distorted guitars, but it’s the short Broom of Wind that unnerves, pairing a jaunty melody with unsettling reverb. Willie Nelson – Last Leaf on the Tree Out now Produced and curated by his son Micah, 91-year-old Willie Nelson’s 76th album, featuring covers and one original, is about “facing death with grace”. Opener Last Leaf, written by Tom Waits, sets the tone, while the country legend also interprets songs by Beck, Nina Simone and the Flaming Lips among others. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food Better Offline Podcast Tech writer Ed Zitron’s analytical series takes a fascinating look at how developments in the tech world affect our everyday lives. Along with expert guests, Zitron discusses everything from the AI bubble to Silicon Valley fashion. Lillian.com Online The late digital artist Lillian Schwartz was a pioneer of animation, using early computing technology to create strangely beautiful abstract visuals. Her website features a range of distinct work, including 1975’s Escher-inspired jazz odyssey, Kinesis. Documentary: The Boy Who Can Fly BBC One, 8 November, 7.30pm Filmed over the course of a year, this vertigo-fuelled documentary follows 23-year-old Scottish Base jumper Liam as he prepares to launch himself off Männlichen mountain in Switzerland in nothing but a wingsuit.

          "headline": "Beer, biscuits and … tools: 2024 Advent calendars – tried and tested",
          "bodyText": "Advent calendars filled with everything from beauty products to chocolate, Lego to tea, are as much a staple in the run-up to Christmas as drinking too much and listening to Last Christmas for the 1,237th time. So, we’ve sniffed, tasted and drunk our way through 12 of them, rating them by their contents, value for money, sustainability and festive factor. And for those who want to swerve products altogether, we’ve rounded up the most beautiful, feelgood paper Advent calendars we could find. Product Advent calendars 2024: the verdict *** Lebkuchen Lebkuchen-Schmidt Advent calendar, £55 souschef.co.uk First impression A cheerful cardboard calendar that folds open like a book and measures a sizeable 58 x 40cm. The brightly coloured, graphic cartoons of a snowy Christmas market scene and, inside, a Christmas tree are cute, but suggest this is aimed at under-fives. What’s in it? Inside are 24 individually wrapped Lebkuchen of different varieties and sizes – from cinnamon stars (tasty and moist) to classic gingerbread to, err, more cinnamon stars – with plain cardboard behind each door. How useful are the products? Not at all, but they’re absolutely delicious, made in – where else? – Nürnberg in Germany, home of the Lebkuchen. It gave me a Christmassy hit every morning: like mince pies, Lebkuchen are almost entirely associated with Christmas for me. 5/10 Good value for money? You can buy two packs of six large Lebkuchen for £6.99 on Amazon, so that suggests not (my favourite Lebkuchen are from Aldi, though). So, even with the extra thrills of the Advent calendar itself, it feels a little overpriced. How sustainable is the packaging? The cardboard box is entirely recyclable, but each biscuit is wrapped in a small, plastic, albeit recyclable at a supermarket, sleeve. Festive factor Extremely – if you’re at primary school. Yet, my 10-year-old turned up her nose at the Lebkuchen, finding them a bit too rich and spiced, so the contents are at odds with the design. Perhaps German children just love Lebkuchen more. 9/10 Hannah Booth *** Tools Halfords Advent calendar, £29.99 halfords.com First impression It’s a box – like a chocolate box, but deeper – featuring an illustration of Santa handling some spare parts. What’s in it? The box says “includes 40-piece socket set”. In fact, that’s all it includes – one 40-piece 1/4in metric socket wrench set. On 1 December you open an enormous door to find a blow-moulded plastic case in which to keep your new socket set. Day 2 brings a rather smart socket ratchet handle. Thereafter, it’s mostly wrench sockets of varying sizes – 9mm, 4mm, 13mm, 5.5mm. By mid-month the sense of anticipation will have pretty much worn off. How useful are the products? There is nothing in this world more useful than a 40-piece socket wrench set, excepting perhaps a 50-piece socket wrench set. I have often wondered if a decent socket collection would change my life immeasurably for the better. It looks as if this is the year I find out. 10/10 What’s the quality like? It’s a pretty solid piece of kit – heavy duty, with a lifetime guarantee – and nothing like the cheap tools you tend to get in Christmas crackers. I’m hoping this socket set will last me the rest of my days. 10/10 Good value for money? At £29.99, it’s £5 cheaper than Halfords’ regular, non-festive 40-piece 1/4in socket set, so it would appear to be a bit of a bargain. How sustainable is the packaging? The box has a plastic inside and a cardboard outside, and is “from responsible sources”. Festive factor It looks like someone typed “Santa tinkering at his workbench” into ChatGPT. The spare parts on the table are unidentifiable. It’s not terribly festive, but if you had a DIY emergency on Christmas Day, you would certainly find its presence reassuring, not to say provident. 7/10 Tim Dowling *** Coffee Pact coffee Advent calendar, £34.95 pactcoffee.com First impression A smart, neat box with a bauble print and nicely packaged sachets of coffee stacked inside. No glitter, sparkles or sign of Santa, so this is more suitable for grownups who like the idea of a caffeinated take on Advent but don’t need it to feel overtly Christmassy. What’s in it? The box contains 25 single-serving sachets of “better than Fair Trade” speciality ground coffee from Pact’s network of small-scale, independent farmers. Each bag is tucked inside a numbered and nicely written information card that tells you about that particular coffee, from the country of origin to the roast, acidity, mouthfeel and tasting notes. Each card also features five blank stars for you to fill in to rate each days brew, which is a nice touch. How useful are the products? The coffees are delicious, interesting and varied. The 18g portions make sense for an Advent calendar, but it does mean you need the ability to brew a single portion. I used my Aeropress, which worked well; single portions don’t suit a large French press or a filter machine. And if you usually make coffee for two or more people in the morning, you can’t share this Advent calendar. But really, who doesn’t want a high-quality coffee every winter morning? 8/10 What’s the quality like? The coffees are excellent, though best drunk black – once you add milk, you tend to lose the subtleties in flavour and aroma and they start to taste the same. Some of the brews are award-winning, and others are made in such small batches, or exclusively for Pact, that this is the only way you’ll get to try this coffee. 10/10 Good value for money? Very – £30 for 25 different, speciality brews? That would be impossible to replicate elsewhere. How sustainable is the packaging? The packaging (cardboard with paper tape), the box and the tasting notes are all recyclable paper or cardboard. But the sachets of coffee themselves are made from a soft plastic that you need to take to a supermarket for recycling (code 5). That’s a bit of a pain. Festive factor More functional than fabulous – the bold red and green design is grownup, with a nod to the season. It looks smart enough on the kitchen counter, but it won’t scratch the Christmassy itch if you’re after twinkly lights, Santa or snowy scenes. 4/10 Ruth Lewy *** Fragrances and candles Sentier fragrance Advent calendar, £99 sentierfragrance.com First impression I love the crisp snow-white cardboard packaging and the beautifully embossed sleeve. It doesn’t feel particularly Christmassy, though, more of a luxe-lifestyle product – but I’m not mad about that. What’s in it? The box opens like a book to reveal 12 numbered drawers, each containing either a 60mg scented candle or a 10ml alcohol-free fragrance. I think 12 items is fair because it would be an enormous box if it were to contain 24 gifts. My favourite fragrance was Méribel because I love patchouli and sandalwood – I was even asked what perfume I was wearing by friends. The Golden River candle had a lovely musk scent. How useful are the products? My teenage daughter and I almost always have a candle lit in the house, and we wear perfume daily, so we’ve got a lot of use out of the products. We also found the compact fragrance bottles perfect for stashing in our bags. 10/10 What’s the quality like? There wasn’t a scent I didn’t like. The candles fill a room with a pleasant smell while burning, and the fragrances lasted well throughout the day. 9/10 Good value for money? Sentier says the calendar is worth £516: it’s difficult to work out if this is accurate because the brand sells its candles only in 150mg for £59 and not the 60mg that comes in the calendar. But I did calculate that six of its 10ml fragrances would cost £192, so you’re already getting more than your money’s worth. How sustainable is the packaging? The box, sleeve and numbered boxes are all cardboard, so easily recycled or, better yet, reused. Each box is filled with a product and shredded paper, which can also be recycled. The candles are in glass jars with plastic lids, so they can be recycled or reused. And the fragrance bottles are glass with plastic and metal lids and a plastic atomiser spray, which may be harder to recycle with doorstep collection services but can be easily refilled and reused. Festive factor The minimalist packaging is aesthetically pleasing but, save for the snow-white colour and a snow-capped mountain range, it’s not especially festive. That said, it would make an excellent gift for someone whose birthday falls in November. 7/10 Emily Goddard *** Wine Virgin Wines Advent calendar, £89.99 virginwines.co.uk First impression Wow, this is heavy! And too big to carry long distances without the use of a sleigh. But it covers all the basics of what an Advent calendar should be: a reindeer drawing provides festive cheer, and there’s 25 windows, including a bonus big one for Christmas Day. Does anyone feel more festive seeing a Virgin Wines logo slapped in the middle of it? I’m guessing not. What’s in it? Behind each window is a 187ml bottle of wine. We’re not talking Château Lafite Rothschild here, but neither has Santa stuffed it with undrinkable plonk. Beginner wine drinkers should enjoy trying a different style each day. A QR code on the back of the box directs you to more information on each wine. How useful are the products? The Advent calendar covers red, white, rosé and one mini fizz. Beyond a surprise (and slightly tart) Italian famoso, it’s not very adventurous, sticking to mainstream grapes such as merlot, sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio. It does the job, if wine can ever be deemed “useful”? 6/10 Good value for money? £89.99 is a fair whack to spend on an Advent calendar, but it’s not a bad price to sample a range of wines. The wines are all drinkable enough without setting the world alight – a Macon-like Aussie chardonnay and French cabernet sauvignon stood out for me in a rather so-so crowd. But the big bottle of Black Pig reserve Australian shiraz on Christmas Day is a stunner, combining fruity accessibility with a backbone of smoke, tobacco and eucalyptus. It’s a great alternative to Chateauneuf-du-Pape. How sustainable is the packaging? The box is made of cardboard, so recyclable. 25 (mainly glass) bottles may seem wasteful but I reuse them to store leftover wine in the freezer for stews and risottos. Festive factor Providing a big bottle for the Christmas dinner table is a neat idea, but this is essentially a glorified box of miniature wines. 6/10 Tim Jonze *** Seeds She Grows Veg heirloom seed calendar, £65 shegrowsveg.com First impression The seeds come in a small, beige sack with a green Santa boot printed on the side. It’s not a calendar by any traditional use of the word, and it doesn’t offer much in the way of festive decoration. It could nestle nicely underneath a Christmas tree, though, or hang from a mantelpiece. What’s in it? Open the sack, and you’ll find 25 individually wrapped packages, in different kinds of tissue paper. Each contains vegetable seeds, across wild and wonderful varieties, from Himalayan pink bananas to Indian purple daikon, plus some good-quality staples, such as oxheart carrots and Rudolph purple sprouting broccoli. How useful are the products? Every seed in the calendar can be planted, and most of the plants eaten, so they are, by their very nature, useful. Each seed packet has a QR code that takes you to a YouTube playlist of tips curated for the specific plant, and I found that genuinely helpful. You’d need a large garden or allotment to plant them all, though, and most of the seed packets will feel a little redundant until their planting season arrives later in 2025. 9/10 Good value for money? At £65, it’s an awful lot of money, although looking at the price of each seed packet individually, it seems a good deal. The variety appears nicely curated rather than thrown together from the cheapest seeds on the shelf. One advantage of the sowing seasons coming later in the year is that this does seem like a present that will last throughout the seasons. How sustainable is the packaging? The fabric sack could, in theory, be reused, and most of the packaging is recyclable, aside from a few ribbons. Festive factor The Advent calendar has a lovely handmade feel to it, almost as though someone has taken the time to wrap 25 presents for you, and the quality of the wrapping is excellent. But is it festive? That depends on how you’d feel to open a Christmas present of seeds. If the idea excites you, this is the calendar for you. 7/10 Monica Horridge *** Tea Whittard tea calendar, £25 whittard.co.uk First impression It’s reminiscent of a classic chocolate Advent calendar, except three times as thick to account for the teabags behind each door. The design is tasteful and fairly festive – not tacky, but not particularly exciting either. What’s in it? The front of the calendar opens to uncover 24 doors, behind each are two individually wrapped teabags of the same flavour: good for couples. How useful are the products? I have a cup of tea every day and enjoy discovering new flavours, so I definitely got a lot out of it. 9/10 What’s the quality like? They’re pretty much all black teas in various flavours. Some were weaker than others – for instance, the vanilla chai wasn’t strong enough for me. 7/10 Good value for money? The calendar’s RRP is £25, which is fairly affordable for a product Advent calendar. It’s a good way to try new flavours, without splashing out on a packet of teabags that you may not like and ultimately shove to the back of the cupboard. That said, many product calendars boast that their contents are worth more than the RRP, but in this case the cost per teabag (52p) is more than if you just bought a pack of them. How sustainable is the packaging? The calendar is made of recyclable cardboard, the teabags are wrapped in a paper envelope (also recyclable), and the bags themselves are compostable. Festive factor The packaging is Christmassy in a grownup way, which some may see as tasteful and others might find slightly boring. 5/10 Lily Smith *** Beer Woodforde’s beer calendar, £65 woodfordes.com First impression It’s chunky, as you’d expect, given the contents. But it’s not the most enticing object and aesthetics seem a low priority here: it’s a box of beers after all. What’s in it? A selection of ales, lagers, ciders and stouts from Norfolk’s Woodforde’s brewery. Each day offers up a 500ml bottle or 440ml can, accessed from above via circular flaps. Accessing them is a challenge: the holes are barely bigger than the cans and bottles inside, and they are quite sharp! How useful are the products? It depends on how happy you are to drink a beer every day for 24 consecutive days: mine started piling up after a while. Still, it may be a useful calendar for anyone looking to stockpile for Christmas or New Year parties. Woodforde’s is a respected Camra-friendly brewery, with an emphasis on hoppy old-school IPAs and bitters, and it’s clearly very good at what it does. There’s only occasional repetition – and the presence of ciders alongside the beers certainly adds to the sense of variety, as do the limited-edition seasonal beers like the Tinsel Toes Christmas ale. 6/10 Good value for money? At £2.70 a can/bottle, it seems reasonable, if not spectacular, value. Pleasingly, you get a decent amount of liquid for your buck: there are none of the stubby cans favoured by many craft breweries. How sustainable is the packaging? Very: the calendar itself is cardboard, with no extra packaging beyond the outer shell, and the products are either cans or glass bottles. No plastic in sight. Festive factor A half-hearted attempt, with illustrations of fairy lights, candy canes and the like – but not the sort of thing you’d want to show off to the neighbours. I found the beers a little too on the hoppy side for my tastes, but I’d happily buy the calendarfor a real ale-enjoying family member. 7/10 Gwilym Mumford *** Cat treats Lily’s Kitchen cat treat calendar, £9.99 lilyskitchen.co.uk First impression It’s a fairly standard Advent calendar, but with cartoon pictures of cats bedecked in tinsel where a baby Jesus or Rudolph might usually be. Deep, but disappointingly light; cat treats don’t have the heft of Lindor. What’s in it? Behind the cardboard windows is a layer of what appears to be plastic that’s scored to make it easier to retrieve the treats behind. Once inside, you scoop a finger, somewhat awkwardly, into a cavernous hole containing a few – five-ish – cat treats rattling around inside. How useful are the products? If you’re a cat, very. But as much as this is my cat’s type on paper, I think these treats have been deployed as bribery to bundle him into carriers to take him to the vets on too many occasions, meaning he is deeply suspicious every time I go to open the day’s window. 6/10 What’s the quality like? There’s no doubt that these treats are of a superior quality to most cat treats. The ingredients are tempting, almost: salmon, chicken and turkey with sweet potato and cranberries (that is until you dig deeper into their composition and read phrases like “hydrolysed chicken protein”). But there’s no getting away from that pong or the dusty texture that seems to be a feature of all cat treats. 8/10 Good value for money? A 60g packet of Lily’s Kitchen treats is £2.50 and this 42g of treat is nearly a tenner. Call me Scrooge, but that feels like quite a high mark-up for some festive messaging that is lost on my cat, if not all cats. How sustainable is the packaging? The outer layer is cardboard, the film layer strikes me as a thin kind of plastic, and the inside structure holding the treats in their slots is certainly plastic. I’d struggle to know whether that can go in the recycling along with the cardboard, but I’ll probably err on the side of caution and put that in my regular rubbish bin for fear of voiding a whole bag of recycling. Sadly, none of it has a use I can think of beyond 25 December, although crafty types may beg to differ. Festive factor There are baubles, a robin, holly, a drum, a tree, a crown, a cracker and something of an in-joke for felines: a fish wrapped up as a gift. Plus, lots of red, green and gold – it looks festive enough to me. My cat, however, seems unmoved. I feel pretty confident he’d be just as happy with the treats without the countdown. 5/10 Ellie Bramley *** Spicy snacks Chili Klaus Spicy Xmas Advent calendar, £60 souschef.co.uk First impression The calendar is adorned with the face of its eponymous Chili Klaus, AKA Claus Pilgaard, a Danish musician turned chilli influencer with a long-running and popular YouTube channel in which Danish celebrities eat chillies. What’s in it? I assumed there’d be at least a couple of mini hot sauce bottles contained herein – but it’s actually variations of a few sweet snacks: spicy chocolate, spicy liquorice, spicy sweets and even more spicy liquorice. Most windows have a little “wind force” heat rating, so you can share them with those with a low tolerance – but there are a few, well-labelled, heat surprises to wake you up on a cold December morning. There’s also the “burning Santa” liquorice ball, which – and I’m really not a spico-masochist – was still on the pleasant side of heat. Proper Scoville-busters may be disappointed. How useful are the products? I’d assumed this would – for £60! – at least give me a few fun new spicy condiments to keep in the cupboard for the next few months, but instead it was all eat-on-the-day sweets treats. Which is fine, but £60! 2/10 What’s the quality like? All the sweets are excellent – especially the liquorice balls, a beautifully Scandi mix of sweet chocolate and salty liquorice, with differing degrees of chilli tang on the back of your tongue. However, half the fun of eating pricey Scandi sweet treats is the fancy glass jars they come in – it’s not quite the same with one or two in little individual plastic bags. 9/10 Good value for money? No. Give me a couple of hot sauces and maybe a little chipotle ketchup or two, and then we’ll talk. How sustainable is the packaging? The box is all cardboard, but each day’s treat is individually wrapped in soft plastic which is, in theory, recyclable but often burned in the UK. Festive factor It looks slightly more upmarket than a standard supermarket chocolate calendar and features a picture of a nice man in a Santa hat. It’s festive enough, but it’s not exactly Bjarke Ingels in terms of Danish design cool. Sorry, Klaus! 3/10 Will Dean *** Smellies Lush Advent calendar, £190 lush.com First impression This is a big beautiful box, designed to be repurposed when the festive season is behind you. The first friend to catch sight of it immediately asked if she could have it when we were finished – although my daughter complained the packaging wasn’t Christmassy enough for her taste. It’s also pretty big (about 35 x 35cm) and, like a Lush shop, gives off quite a strong sweet smell, but if you’re into Lush, you’ll be into it. What’s in it? A total of 24 Lush goodies, festively themed: Father Christmas bath bombs, candy cane bubble bars, “Yog Nog” body lotion, Merry Kissmas lip scrub, a Christmas lights soap, shower gels, a perfume. You get the idea … How useful are the products? You can have a festive wash every day in the run-up to Christmas, and the contents will probably keep you going into January. 9/10. What’s the quality like? There’s lots of fizzy fun inside with berry, spicy, cinnamon smells. And, of course, Lush opts for sustainable ingredients and has an environmental policy, which is reassuring. 8/10 Good value for money? Let’s face it, this is not cheap. I tried to work out whether the individual cost of the contents added up to the hefty price tag, but some of the items seem exclusive to the Advent calendar, so it’s not easy to do like for like. My back-of-the-envelope sums suggest the whole package is slightly more than you’d pay for the contents individually – but then again, you get the lovely reusable box. Lush is also trialling an Advent calendar refill this year, so those who bought last year’s calendar can refill the box with this year’s products. Presuming they’ll offer the same next year, this may help justify the cost. How sustainable is the packaging? It’s all cardboard and reusable. Festive factor It’s very pretty even though it doesn’t feel Christmassy on the outside (and the contents make up for that). 5/10 *** Spices Terre Exotique spice discovery calendar, £34.99 souschef.co.uk First impression Tasteful. Grownup. Niche. French. What’s in it? It’s essentially a sampler of the global flavourings sourced by spice merchant Terre Exotique over 25 years, filled with tiny plastic sachets of salts and spices. If you’re wondering what timur berry from Nepal, Breton curry or white Penja pepper from Cameroon are like, this is your fantasy tasting tray. There are QR codes for recipes behind each flap. And no chocolate. How useful are the products? The packets contain, at most, a scant teaspoon, so they’re not keepers, but they allow adventurous cooks to test two dozen flavours. I wanted to perk up some chicken breasts and liked the Viking salt (onion, “smoke flavour” and turmeric) and sea salt with grilled spice. The speculoos spice blend warmed up my cherry compote, but I had no use for the foie gras mix. Incredibly – by which I mean mercifully – only one sample featured the overhyped luxury seasonal treat of truffle (21 December, the shortest, darkest day of the northern year, so it was probably meant well). Christmas Eve was a chai blend, which you may consider charmingly calming or a total buzzkill. Enjoy deciding how to store 24 miniature bags of spices with a hangover on Boxing Day. 6/10 What’s the quality like? Impossible to judge but full marks for exoticism and inspiration. It’s like a pro-level version of those quick and easy midweek meal kits. 7/10 Good value for money? It gives you 24 samples for the cost of buying about four whole products. How sustainable is the packaging? The cardboard box and plastic tray can be recycled, but it feels like a lot of packaging. Festive factor Not festive at all. The folding, ribbon-tied box is illustrated with a red-and-white design like toile de Jouy, but the image is of a woman picking leaves rather than bucolic flirting. There is no spicy Santa. Quelle tentation! Quelle déception! 0/10 Tim Lusher *** The best picture Advent calendars in 2024 *** Best for book lovers Oxfam bookshelf Advent calendar, £3.99 onlineshop.oxfam.org.uk This adorable picture calendar has a brain teaser behind each door, and all profits go to Oxfam. *** Best for gardeners Kew Gardens Advent calendar, £4 shop.kew.org Kew’s offering features a festive image of the gardens with a traditional Christmas image behind each door.

          "bodyText": "Seeing a room full of teenagers, some as young as 14, screaming their lungs out to a version of Aqua’s 1997 track Barbie Girl in 2024 is a surreal experience no one could have predicted a few years ago. But not many artists embody the unpredictable world of contemporary music more than Ice Spice. After appearing from seemingly nowhere and going viral with her track Munch (Feelin’ U) in 2022, the Bronx rapper went stratospheric and was quickly being declared “rap’s new princess” before collaborating with Nicki Minaj on the Barbie soundtrack. Merging drill, hip-hop, and Jersey club music with a pop sheen – a “rap bitch on a pop chart” in her own words – Spice’s tracks never break the three-minute mark and so within 10 minutes she’s rattled through a bunch: from the bass heavy gurgles of Princess Diana to the melodic synth loops of Phatt Butt, the rapper letting rip some of her most animated and tight flows on the latter. Spice’s near-constant twerking gets audience squeals, as a cohort of dancers move gracefully and powerfully around her, while the DJ fires off air horn and broken glass sound effects with almost comical regularity. The venue isn’t full at all but it pops off regardless, with giddily high octane pace and energy from artist and audience. In the end she performs 21 tracks in just 45 minutes. This rapid-fire approach is impressively succinct, allowing pop hooks and booming beats to fizz and bubble before quickly settling down and disappearing – but it can also feel slightly bitty and restless. However, the final run offers up some pleasing variety and range: there’s a thunderous Did It First, the slowed down yet slick Fisherrr, and the squelchy bounce of closer Think U the Shit (Fart). The visual backdrop for the evening is all Internet Explorer pages, Nokia phones and Tamagotchis in line with her album title Y2K, but Spice’s musical approach feels distinctly more modern. It’s less like a prolonged game of Snake on a black and white screen, and more like a frantic scroll through endless Technicolor content until you have 90s Eurodance hits and flatulent rap anthems blurring into one. • Ice Spice plays Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow, 31 October, then touring"

          "bodyText": "When I got the call-up from the Guardian to do this particular article as a rising star (I’ve been rising for about 10 years now), I thought: perhaps I need to outdo all my cool girl counterparts. I need to pick all the niche, arthouse Tina Fey/Amy Poehler vintage SNL sketches. I’ve got to show all the comedy misogynists that I’m surprisingly cultured for a bleach blonde. After all, I did pretend to like all their favourite indie films in high school (by indie I mean Donnie Darko and The Godfather II.) Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The internet is the only way I got a start in this business. What would I have done in 2005? Sent my Blu-ray disc into the ABC with all the different human and animal impressions I could fit into three minutes? Edited in iMovie, of course, with bubble text in the corner: “Fruit Bat – by Ruby Teys”. I still may have to do that, actually. I’d love to show you the internet that raised me. After all, I owe my whole career and adult life to the beautiful sweet sexy gorgeous internet! 1. Vine, Dubsmash and Triller: Jay Versace Like Chippendale and Redfern, the internet has been gentrified. Before TikTok there was Vine, Dubmash and Triller. Vine: a six-second looping video platform that trained our brains to see the best of humanity in the shortest time possible while making superstars of young middle Americans! Superstars discovered in their bedrooms – Jay Versace being the best example. Triller and Dubmash were the first apps to allow us to mime our favourite songs and movie scenes into our phone cameras. Who knew that, in a few years, a combination of the two would still have us gripped – the reason our attention spans have a limit of approximately 21 seconds. Jay Versace went on to become a record producer, producing hits for Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry and Tyler, the Creator. He has successful endorsement deals with Sprite and MTV. This is one of the videos that started it all. 2. Cameradancer100 YouTube bloggers owe a lot to the original influencer, a young Cameradancer100, who would do countless song requests after school. This rendition of “oh baby baby” shaped my life on “the YouuuTuuubeeee and Facebooook”. 3. Bec Shaw I once walked down the street in Salt Lake City and was handed a Mormon pamphlet about God actually creating the sawn-off shotgun on the eighth day. If Johnny Howard bought back all the sawn-off shotguns here in Australia on the 128th day of 1996, then call the cops because Bec Shaw kept her bullets in the form of tweets. And she shoots me in the face with them 360 days a year. Bec is a comedy powerhouse of genius tweets, scripts and everything else really smart. Like really, really smart. See for yourself. Today’s Shakespeare. Rebecca Shaw tweets kill. 4. Christmas Bitch Josh Quinton, one of the best digital artists and animators to come out of the UK. Every detail oozes camp excellence and style. What a genius. Once you pop you can’t stop. I dare you to go down the Josh Quinton rabbit hole. You’ll feel cooler. 5. Someone Gay Presents The golden year for iconic reality TV moments that would circulate the internet for decades to come was 2012. Big Brother UK’s David is Dead is a prime example, where internet sensation Tiffany Pollard and Angie Bowie had a monumental misunderstanding that would change the course of history. Here is Sydney production company Someone Gay Presents turning the infamous scene into a piece of electric, immersive theatre at the Ace hotel. Yes, it’s verbatim. 6. Me It’s me. 7. Heartthrob Anderson I’m glued to this Instagram account. Rob Anderson is an NYT-bestselling author and joke writer. He is currently rewatching all the 90s movies and shows where we couldn’t quite grasp the plot holes and twists. I screamed when he did Indian in the Closet. Obviously. Absolutely Jatz crackers. 8. Serge Gainsbourg’s retirement tribute Moving stuff. If I ever go out, I need to go out like this. Also, pure evidence that some people just cannot die … even after smoking 83 cigarettes a day for 67 years straight. Slay! 9. British people literally doing anything on the internet in 2011 From “Which one of youse did a sheit?” to “I’m claustrophobic Darren!?!” … it doesn’t get much better than this. 10. The Green Carnation Big week? Pour a vino, run a bath and pop this on. Ruby Teys is an actor, comedian and performance artist from Sydney who walks the fine line between nostalgic bogan subculture and highbrow, nudie-rudie shows. She is hosting Alt Stars Xmas Chaos, a holiday extravaganza, at Sydney’s Factory theatre on 6 December"

          "headline": "Amy Poon’s recipes for Chinese home favourites: spring onion and ginger noodles, and braised pumpkin with pork",
          "bodyText": "It’s good to keep things simple, and I am on a mission to demonstrate just how simple Chinese cooking can be, particularly the kind of food that Chinese families eat at home. We don’t, typically, gather around the kitchen table to pleat dumplings together – Crazy Rich Asians is no more a representation of how we cook than Notting Hill is of Notting Hill! The secret to much of our cooking is in the prep. Thereafter, most dishes come together very quickly and are surprisingly easy – at least the ones I cook are – so I invite you to surprise yourselves with these warming, comforting dishes. Ginger and spring onion oil noodles (pictured above) This is a kitchen staple, a Chinese version of aglio e olio that requires only eight easy-to-find ingredients, most of which you may already have in your cupboard. Spring onion oil doesn’t traditionally include ginger, but here I have merged two classics to combine some of my favourite flavours. Prep 5 min Cook 10 min Serves 2 3-4 spring onions 3-4 slices fresh ginger, peeled 2 tbsp neutral cooking oil – I use sunflower 1 tbsp light soy sauce 1 tbsp dark soy sauce ½-1 tsp sugar, to taste 160g noodles – egg, wheat or even tagliolini! ½ tsp toasted sesame oil Wash and dry the spring onions, trim off the roots, then cut into even lengths – I usually cut each onion into three or four pieces. Cut each piece lengthways into quarters, so you now have strips of spring onion. Cut the sliced ginger into thin strips. Put a wok or large frying pan on a low-medium heat. Add the oil, spring onions and ginger, and fry gently, stirring, for about seven minutes, until the onions turn golden brown. Lift out the onions and ginger with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the now fragrant oil in the pan. Lower the heat, then add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and sugar, to taste, to the hot oil in the pan – note that it will bubble a bit. Cook the noodles in a large pan of boiling water, according to the packet instructions, then drain and transfer them immediately to the soy sauce pan. Pour in the sesame oil, then toss to coat the noodles evenly. Serve either as a sharing plate or in two bowls, garnished with the fried spring onions and ginger. Braised pumpkin with minced pork Pork and pumpkin are quite a common Chinese combination. That must have something to do with the wonderful pork fat, which makes just about everything taste better. You can make this with larger cuts, such as shoulder or ribs, but mince means this is the quickest of braises and perfect for a speedy weeknight supper. It has all the warmth and comfort of a stew without the associated consumption of time and power. You’ll need a wok (or large frying pan) with a lid. Prep 15 min Cook 30 min Serves 4 as part of a family-style dinner 200g pork mince – the fattier, the better For the pork marinade ½ tsp sugar A pinch of salt 1 tsp neutral oil – I use sunflower ¼ tsp white pepper ½ tbsp potato starch, or corn starch ½ tbsp light soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil For the pumpkin 2 tbsp neutral cooking oil 2-3 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed and minced 2-3 slices fresh ginger, peeled 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine, or dry sherry 2 tbsp light soy sauce 1 tbsp oyster sauce Sugar, to taste 600-700g peeled and deseeded pumpkin, cut into largeish chunks 2⅓ tbsp potato starch slurry, or corn starch slurry – that is, 1 tsp starch mixed with 2 tbsp water Chopped spring onions, to garnish Put the pork mince in a bowl with all the marinade ingredients and a tablespoon of water, then mix well to combine and make sure all the flour gets fully absorbed. Put the oil in a wok or large frying pan on a medium-high heat, add the garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for about a minute, just until they’re fragrant. Add the pork mince and stir-fry, breaking up any lumps with a spoon or spatula, for about five minutes, until cooked and golden all over. Stir in the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce and oyster sauce, then add sugar to taste and to balance the flavours. Add the pumpkin to the mix, then pour over 500ml just-boiled water and bring to a vigorous bubble. Cover the wok, turn down the heat to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the pumpkin is softened to your liking. Stir in the potato starch slurry, to thicken the cooking juices, then plate and garnish with the chopped spring onions. Serve with steamed rice.

          "bodyText": "Colour equals flavour, thanks to a process known as the Maillard reaction, which occurs when proteins and sugars are transformed by the application of heat. For this reason, “you always want to sear meat before putting it in a pan or into the oven”, says Charlie Crote, head chef of the Midland Grand Dining Room in London. “This builds a crust on the outside, and firms up the meat [in a good way].” It’s worth noting, though, that this simple technique is all about flavour; it’s sometimes said that browning meat also seals in the juices, but that’s simply not true. First up, you need a really hot pan. “Leave it on a high flame for a couple of minutes,” says Skye Gyngell, chef-patron of Spring in London, and culinary director of Heckfield Place in Hampshire, “until you see a gentle smoke rise from the centre of the pan.” Then add oil – extra-virgin olive oil in Gyngell’s case, vegetable or sunflower for Crote – and swirl it around so the pan is evenly coated. Next, generously season the meat, which should be at room temperature and as dry as possible (moisture is your enemy here), with sea salt and black pepper: “If you do this any earlier,” Crote says, “it will draw out the moisture, which means, when you put the meat in the pan, it will just have a layer of moisture on the outside and will boil rather than sear.” It’s only once any excess moisture has evaporated that the meat can start to brown. On hitting the pan, the meat should sizzle immediately, and make sure there’s plenty of space between each piece. “It’s really important not to overcrowd the pan, otherwise the meat will stew rather than brown and get that lovely crust,” Gyngell adds. “Don’t fuss with it, either, by which I mean don’t prod and constantly turn it.” Rather, you want to leave the meat to do its thing – even if it looks as if it’s sticking to the bottom, “once the crust forms, it will eventually release itself”. When you’ve got that deep colour and good crust, take the meat out of the pan, leave to cool for a minute, then transfer to, say, a roasting tray (along with anything else you might want to have with it in, for example, a traybake dinner). “This rest will help to keep in the flavour and make the meat more pleasing in colour,” Gyngell says. But don’t do anything daft such as cover it with foil, Crote adds, otherwise “it will sweat rather than roast, so leave it open and exposed to get that drier roasting”. Always remember to deglaze the browning pan, too – there are a lot of crisp, tasty bits to be had there. Gyngell pours off any excess fat, wipes the pan lightly with kitchen towel, then returns it to the heat. “Add some wine, leave it to bubble and reduce, then add any other flavourings and tip into the meat tray.” If a stew or braise is your jam, meanwhile, remember that low and slow will win the day: “It will also taste so much better if it’s made ahead of time, left to cool, and reheated,” Gyngell says. Happily, that makes such dishes ideal for autumn entertaining, too. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "Even seasoned aficionados of avant-garde music are unlikely to have witnessed a musician playing a mini concerto for bubble wrap. But that’s what the composer Tonia Ko is playing tonight. She’s at the front of the stage, miked up, rhythmically rubbing and rustling various sizes of plastic packaging while the string section of the London Symphony Orchestra play a suitably squeaky and discordant accompaniment. During a rubato-heavy “solo”, where she crunches some small-gauge bubble wrap and then “pops” a particularly large variety of industrial packaging, she even elicits applause. This kind of thing is par for the course with Nonclassical, a series of sporadic club nights launched in 2004 by Gabriel Prokofiev. The grandson of the Russian composer Sergei and a fascinating orchestral composer in his own right, Gabriel also played punk-funk with the band Spektrum, made electronica under the pseudonym Medasyn and provided grimy production for the rapper Lady Sovereign, and he wanted to bring some of that demotic energy to the “contemporary classical” world, taking it out of the conservatoire and the concert hall. His Nonclassical sessions took place in unprepossessing pubs such as the Shacklewell Arms in Dalston or the Macbeth in Hoxton, where you’d nurse a pint of Guinness while string quartets played computer game music or Guildhall students made space-age sonatas on theremins. Tonight Nonclassical celebrates its 20th birthday with an uncharacteristically huge showcase in front of around 1,500, playing small-scale pieces that have been performed at its club nights over the years, but arranging them for the LSO, under conductor Darren Bloom (who expands his own small-scale 2015 composition Xativa Street). Sasha Scott plays her synth-drum-driven piece Inertia, this time with a full orchestra mirroring her woozy, pitch-bending synth manipulation. Emily Abdy screams out the lyrics to Not Getting Any while her minimal backing takes on an epic, stompy, symphonic arrangement. A Christian Mason piece, based on a Tuvan folk song, sounds like Aaron Copland meets New Order. The centrepiece is the premiere of Sift, the first piece for orchestra by the electronic musician Beatrice Dillon; it’s a wondrously fractured, spiky, space-filled piece made up of interlocking fragments of atonality shared among different parts of the orchestra. The highlight of the evening, however, is the Concerto for Drum Machine and Orchestra, first performed at the Village Underground in 2018, where various composers created ways of using the distinctive R&amp;B sounds from a Roland TR-808 alongside an orchestra: best of all might be Josephine Stephenson’s final section, where the drumbox’s rolling tom-tom riffs and bleepy claves are set against drowsy, legato strings. Part of Nonclassical’s ethos has been to remove the distinctions between high and low art, but there’s an irony that this big-budget celebration only emphasises notions of privilege, as orchestras are incredibly expensive, hierarchical institutions. Sometimes, small-scale laptop experiments really are dignified by being performed by 40-piece ensembles, and it’s wonderful that the eccentrics at Nonclassical are able to make that happen."

          "bodyText": "‘What is it about Richard Gere?’ the Observer asked in 1998, when a slightly prickly encounter between Hollywood’s ‘most famous Buddhist’ and journalist William Leith seemed to rattle Gere’s zen composure. Gere was unnerved when Leith attended two group interviews promoting Red Corner, his latest film. ‘“You again,” he said, looking definitely put out. I sat down. He eyed me cagily.’ When it came to their one-to-one, ‘there was a flash of intense discomfort in his eyes. He made a comment accusing me of following him around, which I was.’ Leith was nervous, too, recalling that in one previous interview with Ladies’ Home Journal, when asked about being a ‘sex object’, Gere reportedly ‘took out his johnson’. There seemed little risk of that; though Gere’s sexual charisma was undeniable, on and off-screen. In his films, he both wore and removed clothes beautifully (‘no awkward moments’), his physicality a crucial part of his acting. ‘Posturing, vulnerable, helplessly aggressive, he looks good having sex.’ At the press junkets Leith attended, Gere seemed to be sealed in a ‘bubble of feline grace’, exuding poise and, above all, control, discussing his work and his faith. But for all that emollient elegance, Leith felt ‘something is eating him up’. He could not work out what it might be: Gere offered no great – or even small – revelations. Acting was ‘a mysterious process’; he ran to keep fit and hadn’t eaten meat for 25 years. He didn’t want to talk about his youthful drug use (‘this was a long time ago’) and refused to expand on his claim of shyness (‘shy is shy’). He wouldn’t even say if he rented furniture in LA (‘It’s not interesting’). Leith didn’t push it (‘Ask too much and he might go for the johnson’), concluding Gere was a vulnerable man ‘who is uneasy with himself’. Their nil-nil draw concluded, Gere smiled and shook Leith’s hand ‘as if I were a great friend’. Elegant to the end, ‘the johnson never came out’."

          "bodyText": "Brown bananas are a gooey, sweet gift from the gods that just keeps giving. If you don’t have brown bananas to hand, it’s just a waiting game, though some supermarkets sell them on discount, to prevent them from going to waste; all you need do is ask. Salted brown banana caramel ice-cream The combination of salted caramelised brown bananas, sharp lemon juice and full-fat cream is quite magical, and creates a moreish dessert that probably won’t last even a day. We ate this topped with a tart mulberry jam, which was great, but this ice-cream is pretty much perfect on its own. Next time, though, I think I’ll try it with blackberry jam, chopped pineapple and melted dark chocolate. If possible, make the custard the day before and chill it properly before churning, because that way you’re more likely to end up with a smooth and more stable end result. This is best eaten on the day it’s made, but if you do have any left over, it will happily keep in the freezer for at least three months, and probably longer. Take the frozen ice-cream out of the freezer at least 15 minutes before you want to eat it, so it thaws and is soft and creamy enough to scoop easily. Makes 6 large scoops 20g salted butter 350g peeled and chopped brown banana flesh (from 3-4 over-ripe bananas) 100g unrefined cane sugar Juice and finely grated zest of ¼ lemon 25g honey 1 tsp sea salt 2 medium eggs 250ml whole milk 220ml double cream 5ml vanilla extract Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, then stir in the chopped brown bananas, 30g of the sugar and the lemon juice and zest. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until the mixture starts to bubble and caramelise, and turn a dark golden brown, then take off the heat and put to one side. In a heavy-based saucepan, whisk the rest of the sugar with the honey, sea salt, eggs, milk and cream. Set the pan on a medium heat and cook, stirring regularly so the mix doesn’t stick to the pan and catch. When the milk mixture starts to steam and you see a bubble or two appearing on the surface, take off the heat, whisk in the vanilla extract and beat until any lumps dissipate. Stir in the caramelised brown bananas – if you prefer a less chunky ice-cream, blitz them first before adding to the custard – leave to cool, then refrigerate until cold, and ideally overnight. The next day, churn the mix in an ice-cream machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions; if you don’t have a machine, pour the chilled custard into a suitable container, seal and freeze for 30-45 minutes. Remove, stir well, then freeze again and repeat five or six times, until your ice-cream is thick enough to scoop."

          "bodyText": "That’s all from us today, thanks for your company and correspondence. I’ll be back in the early morning to bring you day three from Rawalpindi, it’ll more than likely be the last day of the series no matter what happens. Don’t miss it. Bye! What a day. England edged in front in the morning before Pakistan ground them down in the afternoon, recovering from 177 for 7 to end up with 344. A three wicket trick at the close puts the home side in a commanding position to take the series. Oh, and it’s only the end of day two! This match has rattled along. Root and Brook will start in the morning with a deficit of 53 to chip off before Pakistan have to even think about chasing. Michael Atherton still has hope for England, do you? Andrew Hill poses the question… I don’t have the brain capacity to crunch the numbers. You have to know your strengths and weaknesses in this life. “At 19/2, England need to score 102 more runs for their total runs in the second and third tests to equal their monster 823 declared from the first test. Have a test team ever scored more in one innings of a three+ match series than they have in the rest of their innings in that series?” “Runs after the fall of the sixth wicket so often determines the result of a Test match” emails Gary Naylor. “They’re usually the product of nous, belief and team spirit. England’s tally of 149 yesterday looked good, but it’s been eclipsed by Pakistan’s 189 today, not something many saw coming I suspect. Credit, then, to the much-maligned Shan Masood and Jason Gillespie, who have put their side in the box seats for a memorable win and given fans of the format yet another example of its unpredictability and charm.” Men all round the bat. Slip, leg slip and short leg breathing down Brook’s neck after Root sweeps a single. Brook gets forward and smothers the spin, something Pope failed to do to Noman last over. Brook collects two runs through the leg side and steers a single past point. The Umpires are twitchy about the light, gloaming in Rawalpindi. In fact, they knock off the bails and lead the players off. England can’t get out of there quick enough but the damage could already be done. 9th over: England 24-3 (Root 5, Brook 3) 8th over: England 20-2 (Root 3, Brook) That was the last ball of the over, here comes Harry Brook. England are clinging on here. They are probably done for already but they definitely can’t afford to lose another this evening. Pope is out! Noman gets one to loop, drift and spin, the ball taking Pope’s outside edge as he pokes out in front of his front pad, that’s what does for him, the ball hitting the glove and plopping up to slip. The side on angle shows Pope was nowhere near the pitch of the ball, Noman’ completely outwitting him with a change of pace. 7th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Pope survives a probing examination from Sajid Khan. Maiden. Six dots. Deep breaths. 6th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Joe Root joins Pope out in the middle, he’ll feel like he owes his side some runs here after that misjudgement in the first innings. Crikey! Root nearly goes in exactly the same way again, playing back and asking to be pinned lbw but juuuust managing to jam the bat down in time! Be still my weary ticker. Pope pushes for one into the cover. Root is shuffling back and across again, clipping for two. Can’t take your eyes of it, more importantly, neither can you, Joe. Crawley on toast! A skidder from Noman Ali thuds into Crawley’s pad bang in front. There’s no inside edge to save him and a review is burned trying to find one. England in trouble. Trouble Trouble Trouble. 5th over: England 15-1 (Crawley 2, Pope 0) The beleaguered Ollie Pope joins Crawley in the middle. You could cut the atmosphere with a rusty spoon. Pope survives the four remaining balls. Wicket maiden from Sajid. Brilliant bowling from Sajid who spears the first ball in and then follows up with a slower ball that loops and drops, beating Duckett on the inside edge and slamming into his pads. The umpire says not out but Pakistan are convinced! Rightly so – the DRS shows the ball was smacking into middle stump. Duckett has to go! 4th over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) A probing maiden from Noman Ali. Flight and guile. Feel the tension. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) Sweep x 2! Sajid Khan back into the attack after one over from Saim Ayub. Ben Duckett drops to his knees and plays back to sweeps to get back to back fours! 2nd over: England 5-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 3) Crawley stands tall and drives off the back foot for a single through cover. Duckett then gets out the sweep and picks up two runs to deep square leg. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 0) Saim Ayub is opening the bowling, Shan Masood getting funky! Noman Ali and Sajid Khan absolutely livid no doubt. England’s third innings gets underway with a Zak Crawley leg bye. Noman is going to bowl the second over, spindly shadows stretching over the outfield. This will be a real test for England. Here come Crawley and Duckett… buckle up. Bowled him with the googly! Rehan finishes with 4-66 and England drag their weary weary limbs from the field. The last few hours have been punishing for Stokes and his men, they now have a tricky hour to face with the bat before the close. They need to wipe off 77 runs before they can start to make their opponents sweat. 96th over: Pakistan 337-9 (Sajid Khan 41, Zahid Mahmood 0) Atkinson takes his metaphorical sweater after getting the breakthrough. Zahid Mahmood is the last man in, I dare say Sajid is going to open his shoulders here… The end of an epic innings! Atkinson gets the breakthrough with a short ball, Saud in two minds whether to pull or not and ends up plinking a simple catch to midwicket. What a knock, entered the fray at 46-3 and departs nearly a day later with a century to his name and having hauled his side to a lead of 70 runs on a tricky pitch. Well batted Saud Shakeel. Advantage Pakistan! 95th over: Pakistan 333-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Pakistan lead by 66 as three runs are pilfered off Jack Leach. Gus Atkinson is coming on to try and bust out a wicket for England. 94th over: Pakistan 330-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Things have calmed down after the pongoing of a few overs ago. Rehan gets through another over with two singles worked off it. 93rd over: Pakistan 328-8 (Saud 130, Sajid Khan 38) Leach continues, Saud and Sajid work the gaps and scamper runs, the lead stretches to 61. This partnership have added 63 runs in ten overs. Ben Stokes has his field spread, not a catcher in sight. It’s not often you see that, England firmly on the defensive, trying to limit the damage. 92nd over: Pakistan 324-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) Well bowled Rehan Ahmed, just a single off his latest over. England licking their wounds in Rawalpindi. Meanwhile… 91st over: Pakistan 323-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) What.A.Shot! Sajid plays an in-to-out lofted drive to a Jack Leach length ball and blasts over cover for a flat four. Bugle sounds. Stand and Deliver! Crank up Adam Ant. Pakistan lead by 56 runs 90th over: Pakistan 317-8 (Saud 126, Sajid Khan 31) Bashir is spared another by Stokes but England’s captain chooses to thrust young Rehan Ahmed’s feet to the fire instead. The leggie does well to get out of the over for just a couple. I’m worn out, Pakistan’s lead stretches past fifty, it’s been high octane stuff post tea. 89th over: Pakistan 315-8 (Saud 125, Sajid Khan 30) Leach does well to keep a lid on things, just two runs off the over as Saud tells Sajid to take a breath and not try to hit every single ball. Twenty more minutes of this and England will be dead and buried. 88th over: Pakistan 313-8 (Saud 124, Sajid Khan 29) Sajid Khan is destroying his fellow off-spinner in Rawalpindi! Six runs clattered over Ben Duckett at mid on… and again SIX MORE. Bashir is wide eyed, the game and series on the line and he’s being well and truly targeted. Four more! Sajid cuts a short ball away to the fence. Fantastic hitting, England are hurting here, NINETEEN runs off the over. The entire complexion of this match has shifted – Pakistan lead by 47 runs. 87th over: Pakistan 294-8 (Saud 123, Sajid Khan 11) More pain for England as Leach leaks thirteen runs off his over! Saud Shakeel gets in on the act and swipes through midwicket for four, that’s his first boundary in 108 deliveries! 86th over: Pakistan 281-8 (Saud 113, Sajid Khan 9) Pakistan still have to bat last on this surface so runs in front will be crucial. That’ll help! Sajid Khan smears Bashir down the ground for SIX. He can be dangerous with the bat and every run hurts England. More runs are scampered and eleven runs are collected off the over. 85th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Saud 110, Sajid Khan 1) Saud knocks Jack Leach’s first ball post tea into the leg side for a couple to give Pakistan a lead on first innings. A single brings Sajid Khan on strike and he’s content to pat back the rest of the over. Here come the players post tea. Scores level. Series on the line. What more could you possibly ask for this Autumnal Friday morning? Jeremy Boyce seems to be clamouring for Harry Brook to turn his arm over: “It seems to me this is a situation crying out for someone who can send down a few sets of head-scrambling concentration-testing Dermot Reeve-styled Dibbly-Dobblers, harnessing the unpredictability of the bowling to that of the pitch.” “I don’t like to see Geoffrey traduced.” Writes Peter Metcalfe. “At Headingley in the 1960s/70s it was quite a sight to see the great man shepherd the scores of autograph hunters into an orderly queue along the boundary before he stood there and started signing. Some signed twice over. And he signed all his books on the sales stand before they were even sold. I also treasure two appreciative letters from him, in blue Quink ink, from when he was outrageously dropped in 1967 for alleged slow scoring.” The players head off for the tea interval without a single run to split them. 84th over: Pakistan 267-8 (Saud 107, Sajid Khan 1) Gone this time! England have toiled for the breakthrough and they get it right at the end of the session. Bashir gets the new ball to skid on and Noman plays across the line on the back foot, he knows he’s done for as soon as he misses it. Brilliant knock though, helped haul his side up to parity. 83rd over: Pakistan 265-7 (Saud 106, Noman 45) Another big lbw appeal! From Leach this time but there was another big edge on it and umpire Sharfuddoula spotted it. So did England as they choose not to review. 82nd over: Pakistan 262-7 (Saud 105, Noman 44) Bashir back into the attack and goes up for a vociferous appeal to Noman Ali who misses with a sweep. Umpire Gaffaney not interested though and England opt not to review. DRS shows that it was clipping leg but would have stayed with Umpire’s call. Another appeal next ball but a big inside edge saves Noman and they scamper a couple with the ball trickling off fine. 81st over: Pakistan 257-7 (Saud 105, Noman 41) New ball but same old. Leach is worked around for six runs off his returning over. England looking flatter than Michael Flatley driving across a fjord with four flat tyres and a broken stereo. Pakistan only trail by ten runs now. Will emails in with another amusing Boycott encounter: “At Trent Bridge in the early 1990s, my friend Ed and I joined a small group of autograph hunters approaching Boycott only to be loudly berated, “Not now, I’m having me loonch!”. Still, I remember this much more vividly than the autographs we did get that day (sorry, RK Illingworth).” 80th over: Pakistan 251-7 (Saud 104, Noman 38) Root rattles through his over, Saud flicks a couple then drives his 72nd single to keep the strike. The new ball is due and has been taken. Aptly, Jack ‘The Nut’ Leach is going to have first use of it. A clip into the leg side off Rehan Ahmed brings Saud a brilliant century. He raises his bat nonchalantly whilst Noman goes gangbusters with his celebration. Arms everywhere, lovely to see. Saud has kept his side in this match and could well tilt the scales in Pakistan’s favour if he stays out there for another half an hour or so. England’s lead is down to just 19 runs. 79th over: Pakistan 248-7 (Saud 101, Noman 38) 78th over: Pakistan 243-7 (Saud 98, Noman 36) Joe Root replaces Bashir and nearly gets a wicket first ball! Root gets one to spit off the wicket and take the shoulder of Noman’s bat, the edge looping just out of reach of Stokes at slip. Noman works Root for a single but gets a ticking off for running down the middle of the wicket, that’s his second warning. Naughty boy. 77th over: Pakistan 241-7 (Saud 97, Noman 35) Noman Ali sweeps Rehan hard to the square leg fence for four! Eeeesht! Nearly a run out next ball as Noman jabs to point and calls Saud for a run, Stokes swoops and peels off a fast and hard throw at the stumps, missing by a few inches. Noman would have been gone too. Stokes wipes his brow with his cap and allows himself a rueful grin. 76th over: Pakistan 235-7 (Saud 96, Noman 30) Saud cuts Bashir for two and then picks up a couple more with a clip off his legs. He goes to within one blow of a Test ton, he’s only hit four boundaries all innings mind. This is Pakistan’s highest partnership of the innings. 75th over: Pakistan 230-7 (Saud 91, Noman 30) Rehan flights a few, Saud and Noman nudge and nurdle, taking the runs on offer. 74th over: Pakistan 227-7 (Saud 89, Noman 29) The fifty partnership is up for Saud and Noman Ali. Pakistan very much in this game. England’s lead down to 40 runs. Bubbling up in Rawalpindi as the incongruous tubthumps of Chumbawumba burst out of the stadium PA system (Tannoy is a brand name, you knew that though). “Hi Jim, given what’s happening in Pune, have New Zealand fired up the patio heaters in Wellington? Has cricket changed forever?\" Jake – emailing from the classroom - this tour fits well with the teaching day” Are you hiding in a store cupboard or brazenly emailing in in front of a classroom of kids? New Zealand going well in Pune, a first Test win on Indian soil on the cards… 73rd over: Pakistan 225-7 (Saud 88, Noman 28) Noman Ali smears Rehan over mid on for SIX! Confident shot and more frustration for England. Well bowled – a good response from the young leggie who rips one on a length, he’s been a bit too short in this brief spell. Time for a drink. 72nd over: Pakistan 215-7 (Saud 87, Noman 19) England burn a review as Bashir replaces Atkinson and Noman Ali tries to sweep a straight ball but connects only with fresh air. It looked outside the line on first glance and so it proved on DRS. England looking slightly frustrated by this partnership, wounding memories of Pakistan’s wagging tail in the second Test at Multan creeping back into the noodle no doubt. The partnership between this pair is up to 39 runs in 14 overs. 71st over: Pakistan 211-7 (Saud 86, Noman 16) Rehan struggles to find his length and is easily worked around for five singles. Pakistan trail by 56 runs. “On the subject of meeting famous cricketers, I was at a Test match with my Dad at the Oval in the late 80s when I was about 10 years old. As we were heading down the stairs between overs to get a drink, a kindly looking West Indian gentleman was walking up the other way. He paused and looked at me smiling, presumably waiting for me to ask him for his autograph. Alas at that stage in my cricketing education I didn’t recognise the greatest all rounder in history, so I smiled back and then edged round him and headed down the stairs. I only realised who he was when I saw his autobiography in the shop later that day.” It’s good to keep these guys on their toes, Tom Barnes. KLANG. I met Sobers a few years ago. Are you daft? Of course I asked him about Malcolm Nash: 70th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Atkinson stitches together a maiden, shaved scalp glistening with sweat under the afternoon sun. Hard yakka. Rehan Ahmed is being summoned, he was the star of the morning session. Can he prise another one out for England? He’s got real chutzpah, watching him bowl is a joy. 69th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Five singles collected off Bashir with a minimum of fuss. England’s lead being whittled away. Mark Lewis is indulging in a bit of chaos theory this Friday morning. “Morning Jim, On meeting your heroes… In early summer of ‘05, a friend of mine was living in Cardiff. During a morning jog, he bumped into Simon Jones, who was running towards him, likely still recuperating from his latest injury. Spotting Jones, my friend mentioned a nasty pothole on his side of the road and warned him to be careful approaching it. “We need you fit for the First Test!” he added. Jones missed the pothole, stayed fit, and the rest is history. My pal claims he basically won us the urn that year...” Say thanks from me, Mark. Imagine a life without this – gudddunk! 68th over: Pakistan 201-7 (Saud 81, Noman 11) Thanks Rob and hello all. Engrossing Test cricket right here, Pakistan trail by 69 runs on first innings and Saud is well set. We could be in for a one innings shoot out to decide the series. Err yes please. Gus Atkinson slams a few into the guts of the pitch, England have gone to a short ball policy it seems – Pope is fielding very close in at silly cover. Lid firmly in place to protect his cherubic features. Noman rolls the wrists and collects a single to take Pakistan past 200. Right, that’s it from me for today and indeed the series. Jim will be with you for the rest of the day. Thanks again for your company, emails, rants and riffs. See you for the West Indies white-ball games. 67th over: Pakistan 198-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Sharfuddoula made two howlers yesterday but that decision, though incorrect, was fair enough – it looked out in real time. Noman is not out! Indeed he did, a gossamer thin inside edge onto the pad. REVIEW! Noman given out LBW to Bashir It looked good, though the certainty with which Noman reviewed suggests he may have hit it. It’s tea in Pune, where New Zealand are 85 for 2. Will Young fell to Ravichandran Ashwin for 25 but the captain Tom Latham is still there on 37. Their lead is 188. 66th over: Pakistan 197-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Saud takes a single off the first ball, almost with England’s blessing as it means Atkinson has the chance to bowl five at Noman. The second zips past the edge; the rest are defended solidly. For a No9, Noman has an impressive technique and temperament. “Having finished reading the masterly tome The Art of Captaincy a few days previously, I bumped into Mike Brearley in the middle of Manchester,” writes Ian Wild. “He accosted me with the words: ‘Do you know where I can find the Piccadilly Hotel?’ I said, ‘Wow, you’re Mike Brearley!’ He said a little testily, ‘Yes. Do you know the whereabouts of The Piccadilly Hotel?’ I said ‘No’, and he walked on rather abruptly. Next time I was in Manchester, I saw we had been only a couple of hundred yards away from the massive Piccadilly. Still my hero.” 65th over: Pakistan 196-7 (Saud 77, Noman 10) Saud threads Bashir nicely between the two men at short extra. Only a single but it was a classy shot from a player who has made a mockery of all the low scores. He’s given only one chance, a really tough one to Jamie Smith on 20something. “May have shared this before but my first meeting with a hero stays with me,” says Pete Salmon. “Waited in the foyer of the Hilton Hotel across from the MCG when I was nine in 1979. Ian Chappell, 53 not out overnight on his way to 75, came striding towards me. I held out my autograph book, but Chappell didn’t break stride, just said to me ‘F*** off mate, f*** off’ and kept going. Never felt so grown up - Chappelli had called me mate and told me to f*** off!” The innocence of a child. Had that happened at 29 it would have been terrifying. I had the chance of interview Chappelli in early 2013; it was only over the phone but I was still genuinely fearful. He couldn’t have been nicer or more interesting. He even asked me if this new lad Joe Root was any good; for once I gave the right answer. 64th over: Pakistan 194-7 (Saud 76, Noman 9) Weird game, cricket. In the first two Tests England’s second-choice spinner was their biggest threat and now the third choice is doing the job. Or rather he was. Gus Atkinson is on for Rehan Ahmed, who is possibly being saved for 10 and Jack. As Athers says on Sky, Noman Ali played Rehan well just before lunch; Rehan also looks more dangerous to the right-handers. Anyway, Atkinson to Noman, with one slip and a couple of men on the drive. An attempted bouncer from Atkinson doesn’t get up at all and whooshes just past the tumps with Noman starting to take evasive action. “Your mention of Boycott’s ruthlessly efficient way of dealing with autograph hunters reminds me of the time I bumped into Brian Johnston at Lord’s,” begins Phil Withall. “It was at a village cup final sometime in the early nineties, he was barrelling along, greeting all and sundry with a happy wave and a pleasant nod. After signing my match ticket he ploughed on ‘having places to be’, yet it still felt meaningful. As if he really appreciated the request, the recognition. A truly unique and wonderful man.” 63rd over: Pakistan 191-7 (Saud 75, Noman 8) Five singles form Bashir’s over, although one ball almost sneaked through to hit Noman in front. “With the Test series likely to be concluded tomorrow, there are some very important questions for this England team,” says Phil Russell. “Namely ‘Where is the nearest golf course?’ and ‘Can we get 18 holes in before it gets dark?’ I presume that Jimmy Anderson will be tasked with sorting this out. Can’t imagine he’s got much to do as fast bowling coach beyond advising Atkinson to bowl at the stumps and wait for one to keep low.” Haven’t you heard? They’ve made him the official reverse-sweep mentor. Right then, the players are back on the field in Rawalpindi. Shoaib Bashir will start, though I’d have been tempted to give Gus Atkinson a couple of overs at Noman Ali. New Zealand are racing along in Pune. They’re 78 for 1 after only 18 overs, a lead of 181. Like the man said. “I remember as a 10-year-old at Hove in the late 1950s, I asked for Jim Parks’ signature, and he shooed me away with ‘not now, I’m busy’,” writes Dr Roger Luther. “ It made a lasting impression, as you can see. ”On the subject of Sussex wicketkeepers. in more recent years I used to take my dad, in his 90s, to a cafe in Rottingdean where we regularly met Rupert Webb and his lovely wife Babs. He was a great chap, very easy to talk to, now buried at the church in Rottingdean where Stanley Baldwin got married and Simon Cowell didn’t (good quiz question!).” Pune update New Zealand are 59 for 1, a lead of 162, with the tantalising chance of an historic series victory. I think it’s a done deal, although I guess you never know with a team as great as India. “On the subject of ‘You should never meet your heroes’,” begins Finbar Anslow. “My modest rebuttals would be Vic Marks (a polite handshake in the Oval car park) and Plaistow Patricia (sitting on the banks of a small river in the Piedmontese mountains).” This reminds me of an amusing scene at The Oval in 2011. Geoffrey Boycott was signing a load of autographs, at which point some guy in his thirties started fawning over him: ‘Geoffrey you were my dad’s favourite player’, etc, etc. The guy was mid-sentence when Boycott barked imperiously: ‘Pen!’ At least Geoffrey signed it to be fair. I’ve heard a couple of stories of England greats telling kids where to stick their autograph book. Today’s lunch break is a full hour to allow for Friday prayers, so play will resume at 9.30am BST. “I find it fascinating that for all of the thrilling adventure of Bazball England still are unwilling to stick their head above the parapet and take a gamble on the excitement a legspinner can bring as their only spin option,” says Tom Van der Gucht. “Instead, we remain obsessed with the safety net that a finger spinner brings by holding an end up. Perhaps the final Rubicon that Morgan crossed with the ODI team through backing Rashid that allowed them to fully achieve greatness that McCullum and Stokes haven’t yet taken. Show them what you’re made of, Rehan.” I might be wrong – it’s hardly without precedent – but I don’t think it’s that. They fast-tracked Rehan when he was 18 and, don’t forget, brought him into an Ashes squad as well. I suspect it’s simply that they think Bashir (who is also an extremely brave selection) is a better bowler and, crucially, more likely to succeed in Australia. There’s also a greater duty of care to young legspinners. England don’t ask Bashir to hold an end up because they know he can’t, not at this stage of his career; they also picked Moeen Ali as an attacking option when Leach was injured for the Ashes. (Even if, weirdly enough, the series turned on a very tight spell from Moeen at Headingley.) If England were playing it safe they’d have picked Liam Dawson, whose form with bat and ball in the last few years is spectacular. England lead by 80 runs after another compelling session. They looked vulnerable at 151 for 4, only for the 20-year-old Rehan Ahmed to take three key wickets in a mischievous spell of legspin. Saud Shakeel is still there, having batted in a bubble to make a splendid 72 not out, so England aren’t guaranteed a first-innings lead. But they’d have taken this position at the start of play, and especially when Pakistan were 151 for 4. 62nd over: Pakistan 187-7 (Saud 71, Noman 6) Noman doesn’t mind hitting out just before the interval. He blasts Rehan back over his head for an emphatic boundary – it almost went for six – and then turns the final ball of the session just short of leg slip. 61st over: Pakistan 182-7 (Saud 71, Noman 2) Saud trusts Noman, who made a vital 32 in the first innings at Multan, and is still batting in his bubble. He’ll have to open his shoulders at some stage but it’s never going to happen on the stroke of lunch. 60th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) Rehan teases Noman with his variations: googly, legbreak, over and around the wicket. A late defensive stroke from Noman denies Rehan a plumb LBW; he has to settle for a second successive maiden. 58th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) With the left-handed Noman in at No9, Stokes brings back Shoaib Bashir. A quiet over, two from it. In Pune, Mitchell Santner has taken 7 for 53 and India have been bowled out for 156. They trail New Zealand by 103 runs on a Bunsen and are facing an historic series defeat. 58th over: Pakistan 177-7 (Saud 68, Noman 0) A wicket maiden for Rehan, who has bowled a thrilling spell of 6-1-19-3. Rehan Ahmed has blown this game open. Aamer Jamal fiddled indecisively at a googly and deflected the ball back onto his stumps. He goes for 14 and England lead by 90 on a wearing pitch. Rehan whips through another over. Jamal is straining to get outside the line so that he can’t be LBW even if he doesn’t pick the googly. Bowled looks more likely – and that’s exactly what’s happened! 57th over: Pakistan 177-6 (Saud 68, Jamal 14) Jamal is beaten by Leach for the second time in as many overs. Pakistan are still picking up singles fairly easily but there isn’t quite the same sense of permanance they had during the Saud/Rizwan partnership. 56th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Saud 67, Jamal 12) From nowhere Saud charges Rehan, has a filthy mow across the line and edges the ball over the head of Stokes at slip. A leading edge from Jamal runs through point for another single. Rehan could easily have dismissed all four batters he has bowled at today. 55th over: Pakistan 169-6 (Saud 63, Jamal 10) Jamal has started with intent. He rocks back to cuff Leach past mid-on for four, an unusual but beautifully played stroke. Leach hasn’t been at his best today, though the next ball is spot on and goes past the outside edge. Meanwhile, in Pune… Mitchell Santner has taken six wickets and India, despite a typically defiant counter-attack from Ravindra Jadeja, are in the malodorous stuff like you would not believe: 142 for 9, still 117 runs behind. 54th over: Pakistan 164-6 (Saud 62, Jamal 6) A shortish delivery from Rehan is forced into the leg side for a couple by Jamal, who then hacks a single behind square on the leg side. “Looks like the England selectors have struck gold by including Rehan Ahmed in the trio of spinners,” says Colum Fordham. “He is clearly the X-factor - low action, brisk pace, sharply turning googly - that is unsettling the Pakistan batsmen who are more used to the slow left arm/offspin combination of Leach and Bashir. Great to see Rehan smile, encouraged by his captain, injecting the young leggie with confidence. Good on Stokes!” 53rd over: Pakistan 159-6 (Saud 61, Jamal 3) Saud Shakeel is batting beautifully and doesn’t need to come out of his bubble just yet, although he will if he’s still at the crease when Pakistan are eight down. Three from Leach’s over; for once he’s the support act to Rehan Ahmed. 52nd over: Pakistan 156-6 (Saud 60, Jamal 1) Jamal inside-edges his first ball, another terrific googly, in the air but wide of short leg. Salman is out! A huge double breakthrough from Rehan Ahmed! Salman pushed defensively down the wrong line at a lovely delivery that straightened to hit him on the back thigh. Bounce isn’t going to save him… and it’s umpire’s call on line! It’s been reviewed and might be missing off, though my hunch is umpire’s call. 51st over: Pakistan 152-5 (Saud 58, Salman 0) Leach replaces Bashir, presumably with the right-handed Salman in mind. He’s been Pakistan’s best batter in this series, averaging 87, but he looks a little nervous at the start of his innings. 50th over: Pakistan 151-5 (Saud 57, Salman 0) So close to another wicket! A beautiful googly from Rehan keeps low and is just kept out by the new batter Salman, who then gets a leading edge when trying to whip across the line. They’ve got the wicket! A beaming Rehan Ahmed has struck with his ninth ball of the day. Rizwan reached out to sweep, missed and was hit on the back thigh. The LBW was given on the field and, though Rizwan reviewed, the ball would have hit off and middle a third of the way up. 49th over: Pakistan 149-4 (Saud 57, Rizwan 23) Rizwan pushes Bashir for a single to bring up an initiative-seizing fifty partnership in less than 13 overs. Time for drinks. England aren’t in trouble but they do need a wicket. 48th over: Pakistan 147-4 (Saud 56, Rizwan 22) Now then, Rehan Ahmed is on for Gus Atkinson. You’d imagine Rizwan will target him, although there’s no real scope to do so during a decent first over. One wider delivery keeps a bit low and is steered for a single by Rizwan, one of three in the over. “Crawley feels like one of those players who will always have a question mark handing over him in the minds of the public,” says Will Vignoles. “Might be wrong but I remember Ian Bell having the same issue until the 2013 Ashes. For Crawley, he was as you pointed out fantastic against Australia and India, has averaged 46 or so in the past 18 months, is part of what is statistically and on entertainment value England’s best opening partnership since Andrew Strauss’s retirement started this whole mess and yet people still want him gone. Duckett may have become the main man, particularly in the subcontinent, but there’s a lot of value in Crawley still. Pope, less so sadly.” One thing that helps Pope is that there’s no obvious replacement at No3. If he was batting, say, No5 I think he’d more vulnerable. 47th over: Pakistan 144-4 (Saud 54, Rizwan 21) 46th over: Pakistan 143-4 (Saud 53, Rizwan 21) There’s no movement for Atkinson, and no prospect of reverse swing, so his biggest weapon is uneven bounce. I don’t think any deliveries have really kept low today; maybe that’s because the ball is a bit older. A series of gunbarrel-straight deliveries are repelled by Rizwan and there’s one from the over. Atkinson’s figures today are 4-0-10-0. He’ll probably have one more. 45th over: Pakistan 142-4 (Saud 52, Rizwan 21) Saud sweeps Bashir firmly for four to bring up a terrific half-century from 92 balls. He was missed by Jamie Smith in the 20s but has otherwise played with an eyecatching assurance. In an ideal world Ben Stokes would save Rehan Ahmed for the tail but he may need to gamble soon because Pakistan are cruising along. This pair have added 40 in the last eight overs with few alarms. 44th over: Pakistan 135-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 20) Atkinson continues to target the stumps in the hope that one will shoot through. Rizwan gets a thick inside edge that bounces safely on the leg side, then pushes Atkinson down the ground for a couple. He’s playing superbly and is becoming a pain in England’s hindquarters. “Any sign of Joe Root warming up?” asks Jeremy Boyce. Nope! “Given his rare failure with the bat yesterday I’m sure he’s itching to make up for the lapse. Actually, this seems to be the perfect occasion and pitch for some of Dermot Reeve’s dibbly-dobbly mash up.” 43rd over: Pakistan 133-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 18) Bashir replaces Leach and is swept deftly for three by Saud; it should have been two but there was an overthrow after a poor return from Rehan. Three singles make it six from the over in total. Rizwan has put England under pressure and runs are starting to come more easily. 42nd over: Pakistan 127-4 (Saud 42, Rizwan 16) Rizwan continues his invaluable counter-attack by clipping Atkinson through midwicket for three. His busy positivity makes him a particularly dangerous player in low-scoring games. “Can we bring in Foakes, bat Smith and drop Pope and Crawley,” says Alisdair Gould. “Foakes catches and offers variety of mind as a batsman. Smith is our current hero. Lance Pope and Crawley as the last act prior to the Ashes? The indulgence towards both must stop.” In fairness, Crawley was England’s best player against the two best teams in the world. I can’t see him being dropped, especially as his game should be perfect for Australian conditions. Pope remains an interesting and slightly confusing case. Also, Lance Pope sounds like an erratic 6ft 8in left-arm quick from Tasmania. The Rizwan effect. Pakistan scored 26 in 12.2 overs before he arrived; they’ve added 24 in 5.4 since then. 41st over: Pakistan 123-4 (Saud 41, Rizwan 13) Leach hasn’t looked particularly threatening today and is swept decisively for four by Saud; a reminder that he was missed on by 27 by Jamie Smith, a tough chance standing up. 40th over: Pakistan 117-4 (Saud 36, Rizwan 12) Gus Atkinson comes into the attack, a logical move given how well these two batters play spin. When he offers a bit of width, Rizwan opens the face to glide the ball for four. Nicely done. He has changed the tempo of the innings already. 39th over: Pakistan 112-4 (Saud 35, Rizwan 8) Blimey. Out of nothing, after a series of exaggerated defensive strokes and leaves, Rizwan slog-sweeps Leach for six. So much for it being a high-risk shot; he absolutely nailed that. “What is unfolding in Pune ( my home for 7 years) is even more tantalising than this game,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “New Zealand are to cricket what Roger Federer is to tennis and Armand Duplantis to pole vault. Loved by all, even opponents.” It’s a long morning session, two and a half hours, the players are taking the first drinks break. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 103-7 (Ashwin LBW b Santner 4) Can’t spake. 38th over: Pakistan 105-4 (Saud 34, Rizwan 2) Stokes must be really tempted to give Atkinson a couple of overs before Rizwan settles. He’s much better against spin and had a torrid time against Brydon Carse in the first two Tests. Against that, the ball is doing plenty, particularly for Bashir. He beats Saud with another lovely delivery that dips and grips. Meanwhile… Watch: Bashir gets Shan with a beauty 37th over: Pakistan 102-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 2) A reverse sweep from Saud is anticipated and then stopped by the diving Stokes, a terrific bit of fielding. One run can make the difference. Saud gets it past Stokes later in the over to bring up Pakistan’s hundred. Rizwan plays a defensive stroke and then waves at the heavens, possibly because the drone camera was too close. He gets off the mark by sweeping Leach for two; England won’t mind him playing that shot. “Dude,” says Ben Bernards, “can you stop trying to jinx us (NZ) and prompt an Indian revival!?” I’m just here for the Freudian slips. Sounds like India have some awful shots today. 36th over: Pakistan 99-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 0) The arrival of Mohammad Rizwan means a left/right-hand combination for Pakistan. You’d expect him to be a lot busier and try to put pressure back on England. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 95-6 (Sarfaraz c O’Rourke b Santner 11) The scene of all scenes in Pune: India are still 164 behind, on a Bunsen, knowing defeat means a first home series loss in 12 years. Beautiful bowling from Shoaib Bashir! He’s got Shan Masood exactly the same way as he did in the second innings in Multan, turning one sharply to take the edge as Shan closed the face. Pope, very close at gully, took a really sharp catch. There may be doubts over Pope’s batting but by flip he is a brilliant close fielder. 35th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) Leach has a couple of slightly better LBW shouts against Shakeel. Still not out though; it’s going to be very difficult for him to get LBWs from over the wicket with the ball turning so much. “After the women became World T20 champions on Sunday, New Zealand continues to amaze, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Population 5 million. I still get misty eyed thinking about the incredible dignity and generosity of spirit they showed after the most heartbreaking of defeats to England at Lord’s in 2019.” 34th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) A low-risk single brings up an excellent fifty partnership comprised largely of low-risk singles. Five runs from Bashir’s over, three singles and a two. England need… something. 33rd over: Pakistan 94-3 (Shan 23, Saud 30) There’s an argument – there are quiet a few – that England cocked up real bad before lunch yesterday, and that if Pakistan bet sensibly, with a nice straight bat, they can eke out a decisive first-innings lead. Ach, who knows. The only certainty is that Pakistan are 173 runs behind. Freudian slip of the day 32nd over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Bashir makes it back-to-back maidens, and tjhough England haven’t taken a wicket they do at least have control of the scoreboard: in nine overs this morning there have been only 19 runs. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 83-5 (Pant b Phillips 18) Look, we can’t ignore this. New Zealand could be heading for their first ever series victory in India, who are in all sorts on a pitch that is only going to get worse. 31st over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Leach, back over the wicket, has a hopeful LBW appeal against Shan turned down by the umpire Sharfudduola. He was outside the line and there might have been an inside edge as well. That aside, it was plumb. It’s also an important day for Sharfudduola, who made a couple of strange howlers in the final session yesterday. Both were corrected by DRS but it’ll surely be playing on his mind. 30th over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 21, Saud 30) Bashir beats Shan with a near perfect delivery that pitches on middle and growls past the edge. He’s been England’s main threat in the first 25 minutes. Meanwhile, this is one of the reasons Gus Atkinson will be needed today. 29th over: Pakistan 90-3 (Shan 21, Saud 28) It didn’t take Leach long to move around the wicket to the left-handers, an angle that has brought him quite a lot of joy in this series. But Pakistan are playing him well this morning, dealing exclusively in defensive strokes and low-risk singles. 28th over: Pakistan 87-3 (Shan 20, Saud 27) Saud has been dropped by Smith off Bashir. That could be a big moment. It was a tough chance, a big deflection from a leading edge, and it hit Smith on the shinpad. Risk and reward department: Ben Foakes couldn’t have played that magnificent innings yesterday, but he would probably have taken that chance. Thanks to Russ Whedon for sending the TMS overseas link. “This series has definitely exceeded expectations measured on the Bazball ‘entertainment first’ scale, hasn’t it?” says Russ. It surely has. The evolution will be complete next winter when Stokes announces before the first Ashes Test that he couldn’t give a stuff about entertaininment or saving Test cricket, he just want to bring the urn home. 27th over: Pakistan 82-3 (Shan 18, Saud 23) Erm, folks, something historic may be unfolding in Pune. New Zealand 259 India 72/4 (Jaiswal has just surrendered to Glenn Phillips’ golden arm) 26th over: Pakistan 81-3 (Shan 18, Saud 22) Saud cuts Bashir very nicely for four. He’s a real threat to England today, an outstanding player of spin, and I half expected Gus Atkinson to start at Leach’s end because of that. Shan looks less comfortable against Bashir and edges short of Stokes at slip. He pushed with hard hands and the ball still landed well short. “While waiting for play to start I’ve been reading Walter Isaacson’s marvellous biography of Steve Jobs,” writes Kim Thonger. “Jobs had a habit of creating a reality distortion field around himself, in which he would bend truth just enough to win any argument. This strikes me as the same approach really good spin bowlers take. The batsman is never quite sure what’s real and what’s trickery. There is no mention yet of Jobs turning out for the Cupertino XI on Sundays, but maybe Walter is keeping it up his sleeve for the closing chapters.” The old zootermeister, Shane Warne, was so good at that. There’s a brilliant passage in Kevin Pietersen’s book, On Cricket, about how Warne worked over both the batters and the umpires. 25th over: Pakistan 76-3 (Shan 18, Saud 17) The one advantage of batting second on a wearing pitch is that you can learn from the opposition’s first innings. England lost five wickets before they twigged that the sweep is a high-risk shot on such a slow, low pitch, and since then the batters on both sides have generally played with a straight bat. Jack Leach’s first over is a quiet, exploratory affair; two singles from it. 24th over: Pakistan 74-3 (Shan 17, Saud 16) A lovely start from Bashir, whose first ball curves onto middle stump and straightens sharply. Shan does pretty well to drop a thick edge just short of Pope, who is very close and under the helmet at gully. Shan gets another thick edge later in the over, this time all along the ground. He’s definitely a candidate for an edge playing against the spin. The players are ready for action in Rawalpindi. In other news, Virat Kohli has just been bowled by a full toss and India are in a bit of bother against New Zealand in Pune. If New Zealand win the second Test they’ll become the first team to win a series in India since England 12 years ago. Here, have you heard this? It might just be one of the greatest debut singles in the history of forever. “As you ease yourself into the new day, an interesting innings by Western Australia has just unfolded in the Australian one-day competition,” says Phil Withall. “Somehow they managed to lose eight wickets for one run, being bowled out for just 53. Spectacular achievement I’m sure you’ll agree...” Amazing! I completely missed that. It reminds me a little bit of that astonishing Surrey collapse against Lancashire in 1993, which in some ways was even worse because they were so close to victory. Read Ali Martin on Adam Gilchr Jamie Smith Over the course of his sparkling 89 he once again showed the class and composure that marks him out as a player of considerable promise. Victim to a couple of rash yahoos in the second Test, Smith was content to first take a look, soaking up 32 balls for nine runs and playing chiefly with a straight bat. Unlike a couple of colleagues higher up, the 24-year-old appeared to trust his defence. Scorecard aficionados, this one’s for you Read Simon Burnton’s report on day one From the sport that once brought you leg theory, this was more like chaos theory. Before this week nobody knew what you would get if you spent the buildup to a game roasting the pitch in a makeshift fan oven. It turns out the answer is wickets, 13 of them falling on an opening day of drama and frequent befuddlement. This is the day, folks. By 1pm BST/5pm PKT we should have a strong idea who is going to win this intriguing series. For now it remains too close to call with any certainty. Pakistan will resume on 73 for 3, a deficit of 194 on a pitch that has had all the bounce and pace baked out of it. The case for England is that they have runs on the board on a pitch that could go at any moment; the case for Pakistan is that, in England’s first innings, batting became less uncomfortable after around 35 overs as the ball started to age. Pakistan’s innings is 23 overs old, which means only one thing: Big First Hour coming up. Really big."

          "headline": "‘It’s going to be much darker’: inside the deadly return of TV masterpiece Wolf Hall",
          "bodyText": "It is a treacherous landscape, the set of Wolf Hall, which sits under grey clouds beside Wells Cathedral. Outside in the field, production vans spin their wheels and horses kick up mud. Inside, the Bishop’s Palace is mined with cables, scaffold and lighting rigs. Visitors are advised to tread carefully. Danger lurks at every turn. “You watch yourself there,” cautions Timothy Spall. “You won’t lose your head, but you might lose your balance.” For three months, Wolf Hall’s cast and crew have shuttled between England’s heritage sites. They’ve shot at Hampton Court (where the planes were a nuisance) and Haddon Hall, Lacock Abbey and Montacute House. Now at last they’re in the final straight. Cooling his heels in his trailer with a flask of hot tea, Spall explains that he has only one scene left to film – performing opposite lead player Mark Rylance inside the columned hall. Spall has been acting for decades. He knows his work back to front. “But you know what?” he says. “I still have the same sick feeling in my stomach. Every time I step out it’s as though it’s the first job again.” If there still exists such a thing as prestige television in this age of un-curated, on-demand content, Wolf Hall fits the bill. The BBC’s gilded Tudor drama is at once opulent and restrained, savage and soft-spoken; a gangster thriller in ermine and velvet, painted in shades of grey and occasional splashes of blood. The original 2015 series covered the first two novels in Hilary Mantel’s Booker prize-winning trilogy (Wolf Hall; Bring Up the Bodies), shadowing low-born, high-flying Thomas Cromwell through the court of King Henry VIII. The upcoming six-parter, written by Peter Straughan, tackles the third, The Mirror and the Light, in which Cromwell – nominally at the peak of his powers – finds himself friendless and under threat. No doubt that’s the logic of every successful career: stick your head above the parapet and sooner or later someone will try to chop it off. Spall has an hour to kill before he needs to get into costume and might as well spend it drinking tea in his trailer. Acting jobs, he says, are a bit like fishing trips. “A lot of sitting around on the riverbank, then suddenly it happens and you’ve got to pull in your fish.” He’s playing Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the courtiers who perpetually circle the king. (The late Bernard Hill played Norfolk in the first series.) History tells us that Howard was Cromwell’s great nemesis, a player in his own right, though Spall prefers to think of the role as a small piece in a jigsaw. That’s what film and TV actors are, he says: a set of moving pieces. “The job is about taking five pages of dialogue – and usually no more than two – and turning it into something that looks real, like it’s happening and that fits with everything else. All that concentration on one little sliver that helps to make sense of the rest of the picture.” He chuckles. “That’s basically it, that’s acting for you. You stand there with your lines and try to make it sound like you are saying them for the very first time.” Wolf Hall’s second series picks right up from the first, in the immediate aftermath of Anne Boleyn’s execution, with Damian Lewis’s tyrannical king demanding total fealty from his subjects. Off screen, nine torrid years have gone by. We’ve had Brexit, Trump and Boris Johnson, war in Europe and a global pandemic. And if it’s true that all futuristic sci-fi is a veiled commentary on modern times, then it’s probably the case with historical fiction, too. It’s unavoidable, Spall says. You don’t work in a bubble. “The biggest thing we’ve had these past nine years is a terrifying move away from democracy, or towards some sort of alternative to it. And this, Wolf Hall, is the biggest advert for democracy you can get, because what it shows in great detail is the system of rule inside a dictatorship. The volatile ego. The bloodline, the politics. That might be where we’re all heading. So be careful what you wish for.” In the chapel at the Bishop’s Palace, the first scene of the day is under way. I take the pew beside director Peter Kosminsky and watch as choirboys in white ruffs sing The Western Wynde Mass. Seated nearby, wearing Cromwell’s black coat and cap, Rylance dips his head to speak to his costumed co-star; his voice pitched so low that the singing all but drowns it out. Ellie de Lange is playing the role of Jenneke. She is leaving for Antwerp and implores him to join her. By this point in the drama, Cromwell’s position is precarious. His enemies are emboldened and the king has turned his back. Here is his off-ramp; a possible means of escape. One worries it might be the only chance he gets. By both accident and design, Wolf Hall’s closing stretch feels particularly death-haunted, with Cromwell’s end somehow echoed by Mantel’s sudden death in September 2022. Kosminsky, for one, is still processing the loss. The director became close to Mantel while shooting the first series. Their working relationship blossomed into a proper friendship. The author would send The Mirror and the Light to him as she was writing it – every couple of months, in 100-page instalments – and he would mail back queries and suggestions. Mantel was an invaluable resource on the first series, he says. He missed her on the second but felt that the bulk of the work had been done. “By the time we came to film I had no outstanding questions. Before she so sadly, unbearably died, we had already covered a lot of the ground. The only question I’d like to ask her is the obvious one: what do you reckon to what we’ve done?” I suspect she’d approve. It’s a fabulous adaptation: a drama that continues the trilogy’s stealthy line of travel; a tale of the past that implicitly speaks to the present. “Well, we are all living through very turbulent times,” says Kosminsky. “So was Hilary, albeit a little earlier. The world was darkening around when she was writing The Mirror and the Light, and we are all thoroughly benighted now.” Outside factors might partially explain Wolf Hall’s journey towards darkness. But the story itself has its own natural arc. “The first six episodes were about ascent,” he says. “They were about Cromwell scrambling from a poor, ill-educated background to the top of the power structure. They had a mood of optimist chutzpah. This is the story of a descent. By its nature it’s going to be much darker.” Executive producer Colin Callender agrees. Nonetheless, he feels that amid all the talk of darkness, we shouldn’t forget about the light. “At its core, it’s about a man reflecting on his life,” he says. “Cromwell’s looking back – that’s the mirror. But he’s also looking forward – that’s the light.” Self-reflection to illumination: that’s the real narrative arc. “So of course it reflects the world we’re living in now and the questions we all ask ourselves. How the hell did this happen? Did I do the right thing? What sort of world do we want this to be? But these are also the sort of questions we ask at various milestones in our lives. When we hit 40, 50, 60 or whatever. When we face our own mortality and look back on the journey. What could I have done better? What did I do wrong?” Callender shrugs. “I never asked Hilary why she called the book The Mirror and the Light, but that’s what it means to me. And watching Cromwell ask those questions of himself is exhilarating.” It is a descent, he says, but it is also a leap towards a kind of freedom. Back at the trailer, Spall has just about drained his flask. Soon, an assistant will escort him to the set. He’ll be put into his costume, led before the cameras for his scene. The film set, it occurs, is the modern-day equivalent of the old Tudor court. It has a similar rigid hierarchy. It’s defined by jockeying egos, pomp and pageantry, and by a boss on the throne who might at any second call “Cut”. Actually, says Spall, it doesn’t feel that way at all. “Yes, the director is in charge. But this is collaboration, not dictation. There’s very little willy-waving going on and, contrary to popular belief, very few power games from people who are of a higher status than others. In Hollywood it’s different. It’s money, money, money. But you don’t smell the money on something like this. You don’t feel the studio breathing down your neck.” In practice, he says, the working day sets the tone – and if there’s anything breathing down your neck, it’s time. There is a schedule to meet and scenes to be shot, and there are never quite enough hours in the day. Everyone is rushing to get Wolf Hall in the can. They’re too busy, therefore, to plot, gossip or backstab. The process of film-making: that’s the ultimate tyrant. “You know what it’s like?’ Spall says. “It’s like trying to get an ostrich inside a Thermos flask. Films blow up and then implode. Think about it. The script for Wolf Hall is the size of a piece of A4. Then all of a sudden it’s as big as all this.” He waves his hand. “What have we got today, about five acres here? Then the implosion is about pulling it all back so you can stick it on a TV screen that isn’t much bigger than the original script. Or even smaller than that – a file on somebody’s computer. That’s the process of making pictures. It’s remarkable, isn’t it?” Spall hands over his flask. “Look, here’s your ostrich,” he says. “I do hope you enjoy it.” Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light is coming soon to BBC One and iPlayer."

          "bodyText": "It was the summer of 2022 when Benjamin Stanley was left pleased and slightly embarrassed to hear he was being referred to as the “hot rabbi” at the wedding he was officiating. Stanley, 41, worried he might no longer fit into the category after a string of sleepless nights with a newborn child. The moniker, however, is gaining attention as a result of the Netflix show about a weed-smoking rabbi, leading some to declare this season “hot rabbi autumn”. Netflix’s hit series Nobody Wants This depicts an outspoken sex podcaster, Joanne, played by Kristen Bell, falling in love with a weed-smoking rabbi, Noah (Adam Brody). The show’s depiction of modern Judaism and, in particular, the rabbi’s character have captured the imaginations of many, earning a whopping 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes since its release in late September. “Fleabag gave us the hot priest and now you are the hot rabbi,” remarked Jimmy Kimmel in an interview with Brody on his show, to which the actor jokingly responded: “I don’t want some of the other facets of his personality to not be discovered: he’s also a hot son, he’s a hot brother, he’s so many other hot things.” For rabbis across the UK, Brody’s portrayal of life as a rabbi is refreshing and relatable. Stanley, who was ordained more than a decade ago and serves congregants at the Westminster synagogue, said it was “pleasing to see a fairly convincing world of Jews and a rabbi who are really applying their Judaism to everyday life in the real world. “I felt more seen by the Adam Brody character because obviously rabbis in popular culture, generally, we do often get these blokes with beards and [Brody’s character] was much more relatable.” Stanley’s sentiments were echoed by the rabbi Jordan Helfman, 40, who leads services at the Oaks Lane Reform synagogue in Ilford. “The life of a rabbi is not isolated and stuck in a bubble of community, it’s with society, and you meet all kinds of different people and all different kinds of parts of life. “There’s the term, moral exemplar, that you’re trying to live the best life, the best Jewish life you can, both personally and professionally.” Helfman added: “I think it’s really important that there’s shows which show Jews as loving, complex, interesting human beings as opposed to many of the stereotypes that you see in society or hear about on social media.” The show’s creator, Erin Foster, said the series was a “love letter” inspired by her real-life love story with her now-husband, Simon Tikhman, for whom she converted to Judaism. In May, Foster wrote on Instagram: “We have a romcom born out of me falling for a nice Jewish boy and never looking back.” Despite the show’s success, the series has attracted criticism for its portrayal of Jewish women. Writing in Time magazine, Esther Zuckerman said: “The series seems to loathe Jewish women, who are portrayed as nags, harpies, and the ultimate villains of this story.” Deborah Blausten, 34, a rabbi who leads services at the Finchley Reform synagogue, said she recognised these issues. “I think it’s well talked about that the depiction of women in the show is not fabulous. It leans into stereotypes of Jewish women,” she said. “There was a sense that while making the rabbi human and fleshed out that, unfortunately, the Jewish women around him moved into the background.” However, Blausten acknowledges there is an inevitable pressure placed on shows representing minority communities. “I think it’s a lot of pressure to put on a Netflix show,” she said. “I don’t think my medical friends look to Grey’s Anatomy to fully define their careers. It’s a challenge whenever you see Judaism represented in the media, which is that it doesn’t necessarily happen very often. “Like any minority community, when you’re reflected in the public eye, people put a lot of pressure on it because they really need to be seen. So we have conversations about this kind of show that I’m not sure we would have about other kinds of shows.” Blausten appreciated the depiction of an “unconventional” rabbi in the series. “We have exactly the same challenges with the religious life as our members do, and I think it’s great and appropriate that they show a member of clergy struggling with the question of how to be a Jew in the modern world.” Rabbi Hannah Kingston, 34, at the North Western Reform synagogue in north London, agreed: “I don’t look like the stereotypical rabbi either, not just because of my gender, but also because I’m in my 30s. And I’m a new mom … [The show] feels like quite a good representation of my life in the bits that I’ve seen so far.” All the rabbis agreed the series is particularly important within the context of rising antisemitism in the UK and the US. The Community Security Trust, a UK charity that records hate incidents against Jews, said it had logged more than 5,500 antisemitic incidents across the UK since 7 October – a 204% increase from the previous year. Blausten said: “In a time when there’s a lot of tension and fear and where it feels Jewishness has been reduced to one particular axis, like a conversation about antisemitism, [when] people take the chance to see Jews in a different way, it can only be a good thing.”"

          "bodyText": "Imagine completing an entire league season unbeaten without conceding a goal and still not being crowned champions. Those are the mixed emotions facing the fourth-tier Swedish women’s club Ängelholm but, as their coach, Ulf Johansson, says, a screenshot of the league table going viral has helped his players start to appreciate the magnitude of what they achieved. They won 15 of their 18 league matches but three goalless draws meant they missed out on the title by a point. His overwhelming emotion, however, is pride. “In the last few games, all the teams just wanted to score against us, so they were using five or six attackers in the last 25 minutes,” he says. “They knew they’d lost the game but they just wanted to burst the bubble for us. But we still managed it. The girls were really happy, there was just a lot of shouting and screaming when we did it. “It’s been really crazy. Everyone has seen the social media and newspapers all over the world have been calling. It’s given the girls an energy boost. It’s been a long season but you can see they’re happy and they finally understand what they have done.” Their season is not over yet as they are competing for promotion via the playoffs and have already come through the first round – winning 8-2 on aggregate, finally conceding – and they are halfway through a two-leg promotion/relegation decider against Strövelstorps GoIF/IF Salamis, a team from the third tier. The first leg ended 1-1 and the second leg takes place on Sunday. Johansson says: “We’re too good for division four, we have proven it, so we need to go to division three to develop the players. That’s very important. “But we had a two-year plan: the first year to establish the team at senior level and then next year to go up to division three. We won’t die if we don’t go up, but now when we have the chance we’re really going for it.” That is another unusual aspect to Ängelholm’s achievements. They are in their first season after rebuilding in the bottom tier with a new squad, having previously played at a higher level before losing players to other clubs. “It’s a young team,” Johansson says. “They’re only 15-17 years old and it’s the first senior season. I’m really surprised that we did this well. I couldn’t dream of it. They have had an amazing journey.” Those youngsters include the 17-year-old goalkeeper Nellie Bengtsson, who played the entire league campaign without conceding. She told the Swedish newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad: “It is quite difficult to take in what is happening right now. It is crazy that we have received so much attention. That is not something we thought would happen. “It all started with someone seeing a video on TikTok that she put in our group chat. Then we’ve seen posts on Instagram and other places. It is great that we managed to go through the season without letting in a goal. If you think about it, it is quite easy to concede. One mistake is enough and the ball goes in.” Bengtsson has been learning from the club’s goalkeeper coach, Matt Pyzdrowski, who played for the American clubs Chicago Fire Premier and Portland Timbers, as well as for Ängelholm’s men’s team. Bengtsson saved a penalty in the campaign and Johansson recalls her tipping one effort on to the crossbar when he had been certain their clean streak was about to end. “Nellie has done some incredible saves. She’ll develop into a really good goalkeeper.” It all provokes one question, though: how did they not win the league? Ljungbyheds IF let in 14 goals but scored significantly more than Ängelholm, to finish with +107 goal difference, and the only time they dropped points was in their games against Ängelholm, who also drew 0-0 twice with third-placed Västra Karups FK. “It was a strange feeling, I have to admit,” Johansson says, on not winning the league. “We beat them [Ljungbyheds IF] 1-0 and then we played away [in August] and they parked the bus. We dominated but we couldn’t get the goal. “After that game we were disappointed because we knew they were probably going to win the rest of their games, but then I said: ‘Hey, let’s go for keeping the zero intact and not losing’. The girls really liked that idea and after that we just fought like hell.” The club’s men’s team are coached by the former Wigan, Groningen and Sweden centre-back Andreas Granqvist, who Johansson says has been a big help to him, adding to the women’s team’s playing style that has ensured all their shutouts: “The secret is how we want to play football. We really focused on aggressive pressing, high up on the field, and keeping the ball under pressure on the opponents’ side. That’s the key this season. “They really worked hard. When we lost the ball, they won it back directly. So it’s been really hard for teams to even get a goalscoring chance.”"

The World’s 50 Best Bars were on Tuesday announced in Madrid, as judged by 700 international bartenders, drinks writers and cocktail specialists. Caretaker’s Cottage, which opened in Melbourne in 2022, was placed 21st on the list and was named best bar in Australasia 2024. “Beneath the skyscrapers in the middle of the Melbourne CBD, there’s a small, humble-looking place that was once the residence of the caretaker of the church next door. It’s here you’ll find a small team taking care of the thirsty, the tired and those in need of a good time,” the awards’ website states of the “neighbourhood joint”. The bar’s “super-cold signature martini, and Guinness so good it causes envy in the local Irish pubs”, plus its “above and beyond service” also earned it the Best Bars’ Art of Hospitality Award. It rose from 23rd place last year. “We’re pretty blown away by the awards. To take out the highest ranked spot in Australiasia was a huge surprise,” said one of the owners, Rob Libecans. “Our little pub is still young, so to even make the list was more than we could ever imagine.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Sydney’s Maybe Sammy, last year’s Australasian winner, came in 26th place – down from 15th position last year. The bar in the Rocks is known for its pastel-pink-jacketed, bubble-gun-wielding bar staff as much as it is for its Instagram-ready cocktails. A second Melbourne bar, Byrdi, was placed 35th and was a newcomer to the top 50. “Byrdi might very well be the most Australian bar in existence. The Aussie-ness of it is everywhere: in the selection of ingredients and the focus on hyperlocal produce, taking advantage of the bounty that comes from Victoria’s farms,” states the website. “Things can be quite technical – there is foraging and fermenting and vacuum distilling – and the drinks are high-concept creations.” Leading the global list was Handshake Speakeasy, a “hip Mexico City establishment” with its own laboratory and decor inspired by the Prohibition era. • This article was amended on 5 November 2024 to reflect that 700, not 680, experts judged this competition."

          "bodyText": "I have now gone through two EU referendums in my life – Brexit and Moldova’s 20 October vote on whether to include EU integration in its constitution. As an EU national in the UK, I was not able to cast my ballot in 2016. I remember the expectation most people had that Brexit would not win. I received the news while travelling in Spain and staying with a British national settled there, who could not vote in the referendum either. Some London-born friends told me they felt as though they could no longer recognise their country, which had been split in two. With that British experience on my mind, I had a sense of deja vu as I watched the results unfold in my native Moldova on Sunday night. As opinion polls before the vote, which excluded Moldova’s large, pro-European diaspora, suggested, there was between 54% and 65% support for the EU. The only fear for pro-European Moldovans was that the turnout would be too small to have the referendum validated. When it became clear that 51% of voters had showed up – more than in other recent elections – everyone in my bubble felt optimistic, posting pictures of their “I voted” blue stickers given out at polling stations. I was in an echo-chamber. When the first results started to come in that night, the anti-EU vote seemed to dominate. It did so for hours. Following the count at a birthday party, my friends and I watched our phone screens in disbelief. One of them kept repeating: the first results come from smaller villages – it will get better as the votes from the capital city, Chișinău, and the diaspora get counted. I recalled the difference between London and other parts of the UK. Just like Wales voted for Brexit although it benefited from some of the biggest EU regional funds, so did the districts of Cahul and Ungheni in Moldova, which received €50m for development. In London, only five out of 32 boroughs voted to leave the EU; in Chișinău, the district of Botanica, traditionally inhabited by Russian rather than Romanian speakers, was the only one to do the same. That’s where I voted. As I came out of the polling station, I heard an old woman ask a younger one what the question in the referendum was. “What, she wants to change the constitution the way she pleases?” she said, referring to the incumbent, Maia Sandu, who came first in the presidential election held on the same day, with 42% of the vote. Many accused Sandu of calling the referendum in order to increase votes for her own election and distract from the slow pace of the anti-corruption reforms she promised to deliver. Some pro-Europeans boycotted it. In the end, the pro-European “yes” vote passed by a whisker, with 50.46% of the nearly 1.5m ballots cast. On 3 November, a second round will see Sandu run against the former prosecutor general Alexandr Stoianoglo, who scored 26%, way above the 9-11% predicted in polls. In the run-up to the votes, officials in Moldova accused the pro-Russian, fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor – convicted of fraud in Moldova, he is now resident in Russia – of running a destabilising campaign from Moscow. Shor denies any wrongdoing. At 1am the morning after the vote, Sandu made a press statement in which she blamed “criminal groups, working together with foreign forces” that had allegedly aimed to buy 300,000 votes – about 20% of the total number of Moldovans who cast their votes. Although the number was more than double that the police and anti-corruption prosecution mentioned two weeks ago, the declaration did not come as a surprise. It had been well-reported that huge amounts of cash were coming into the country via Chișinău airport, with authorities accusing Shor of running an operation to buy political influence. On Telegram, Shor openly “offered to pay voters the equivalent of $29 if they registered for his [No or abstain] campaign” and pledged to “pay Moldovans for publishing anti-EU posts on Facebook and Telegram”. While the authorities detained some of the people involved, they did not foil the entire scheme before the elections. National and international observers, the EU and the US, all condemned what they described as Russia’s interference. Of course, there are also internal causes that explain the tight EU vote in Moldova, just like there were with Brexit. They range from the Russification that Moldova went through during its 40-year occupation by the Soviet Union, the dominance of Russian media until 2022 and its only partial ban since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to frustration with the government and the slow pace of reforms. These are vulnerabilities that Russian propaganda is good at taking advantage of, but they will need to be addressed if Moldova is to continue its European path. Until then, the country needs international support in fighting malign foreign influence, before its second round of presidential elections in two weeks and parliamentary elections next summer.

An earlier version said that Havering was the only London borough to have voted to leave the EU; in fact, Havering was among five of London’s 32 boroughs to have had leave majorities."

          "bodyText": "In 2014 a mysterious crater suddenly appeared on the Yamal peninsula in north-west Siberia. The debris surrounding this 50-metre-deep hole suggested it had been produced by an explosive process. Since then, scientists and local people have discovered several more craters on the Yamal and nearby Gydan peninsulas and a multitude of explanations have been put forward, ranging from meteor impacts to natural gas explosions. Now a new study has revealed the cause. Drill down through the seasonally frozen soil in this region and you reach a thick clay permafrost layer. Sandwiched between the soil and permafrost lie unusual metre-thick ponds of very salty water known as cryopegs, which are underlain by crystalised methane-water solids, kept stable by the high pressure and low temperature. Researchers found that warmer temperatures and longer summers in recent decades had resulted in the soil layer defrosting to greater and greater depths. Their results, published in Geophysical Research Letters, show that when the thaw reaches a cryopeg, the pressure from added meltwater forces cracks to open in the soil above. The new cracks create a sudden drop in pressure, which destabilises the methane hydrate and releases an explosive bubble of methane gas. Although infrequent, the explosions release large amounts of methane and could have a significant warming impact."

          "headline": "IMF warns markets are underestimating geopolitical risks; UK faces a ‘narrow path’ on debt reduction – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up: here are today’s main stories. Firstly, on the IMF’s annual meetings in Washington DC today: The UK public finances… And also: The IMF has identified three risks to its forecast for 3.2% global growth in the next two years, my colleague Larry Elliott writes: First, there’s a risk that central banks will be too slow in reducing borrowing costs, leading to slower growth and a reassessment by financial markets of their Goldilocks scenario for the global economy. Markets have bought heavily into the idea that central banks will get policy just right, engineering a return of inflation to targets without a recession. That may be true in the US, it looks less clearcut for the eurozone. The second risk is that the war in the Middle East escalates and leads to a sharp increase in oil prices. So far, commodity markets have been relaxed about the heightened tension because they see no immediate danger of crude supplies being cut off, but that could rapidly change. Gourinchas said: “An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets.” It is a warning worth heeding. Finally, there’s the elephant in the room – the possibility that Donald Trump will return to the White House after next month’s US presidential election. While not mentioning the former president by name, the IMF estimates that a shift towards “undesirable” industrial and trade policies could reduce global GDP by 0.5 percentage points in 2026. As far as the IMF is concerned, imposing trade barriers and subsidising domestic industry provides a sugar rush but the measures often lead to retaliation and fail to improve living standards in the longer term. After a flurry of warnings from the IMF this afternoon, London’s stock markets have closed slightly lower. The FTSE 100 share index has ended the day down 11.7 points, or 0.14%, at 8306 points. Many European markets clawed back their earlier losses, with France’s CAC and Spain’s IBEX finishing the day flat. The IMF has also voiced concerns about the drive to encourage pension funds to invesst in riskier assets. Its new Global Financial Stability Report outlines how encouraging investment in illiquid assets heightens the risk of market instability. The IMF is concerned that the increased investment in illiquid private equity and credit in recent years by pension funds is creating a growing “liquidity mismatch” – because pension fund holders could want access to their money quickly, but some underlying assets would take longer to sell. This could force funds to sell more liquid assets, it explains: Furthermore, liquidity stress could spill over to financial markets, especially those markets in which pension funds and insurers have a large footprint, such as government bonds, equities, and corporate bonds. The Fund cites former chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s drive to encourage defined-contribution pension schemes to boost investment in unlisted UK equities. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has thrown her backing behind fair trade, in a pushback against the threat of more protectionism in the US. In an interview with Bloomberg, Lagarde was reminded that Donald Trump recently said that ‘tariffs’ was his favourite word. Lagarde, though, insists that the US has thrived thanks to free trade. She says: Fair trade is a key boost for growth, for employment, for innovation, for productivity. It is something that we should not throw away. Lagarde adds that the times in history when the US has thrived were periods of trade, not periods of “I’m going to retire behind my boundaries and play at home”. The IMF has also warned that vulnerabilities are building up in the financial system, as markets may be underestimating the risks from conflict and upcoming elections. In its latest Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund flags that there is a “widening disconnect” between “elevated economic uncertainty — stemming from ongoing military conflicts and the uncertain future policies of newly elected governments” and the low volatility in the financial markets. In a warning note, the Fund reminds investors of the brief plunge in market values less than three months ago, saying: Market turmoil in early August, though short-lived, served as a reminder of how quickly volatility can catch up to uncertainty, force the unwinding of leveraged trades, and trigger feedback loops between asset prices and deleveraging. The IMF has also warned that it is very concerned about rising trade protectionism, at a time when a possible Donald Trump presidency looms over the global economy. Chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas tells reporters in Washington DC that there has been a very sharp increase in the number of trade-distorting measures implemented by countries over the last five years, from 1,000 in 2019 to 3,000 today. The IMF has calculated the impact of rising trade tensions, leading to a permanent increase in tariffs starting in mid-2025 and affecting a sizable swath of global trade. This, it says, would cut 0.8% off global GDP in 2025, and another 1.3% in 2026. Gourinchas says: There is definitely a direction of travel here that we are very concerned about, because a lot of these trade-distorting measures could reflect decisions by countries that are self-centred and could be ultimately harmful not only to the global economy… but also hurful for the countries who implement them as well. The impact on global trade also makes the residents of a country [implementing tariffs] poorer. [Reminder, Trump has proposed a 10% across-the-board levy on all products imported into the U.S. from overseas.] Back in Washington DC, the IMF’s chief economist has warned that the monetary stimulus measures annouced by China won’t lift growth in a material way. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas explained that today’s growth forecasts don’t incorporate the new fiscal stimulus measures announced by the People’s Bank of China. However, he suggests that are not sufficient to lift China’s growth rate significantly. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is also in the US to attend the IMF’s Annual Meeting, and warning against complacency over the risk of financial crises. Speaking at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum in New York, Bailey channels mythological Greek Cassandra – whose warnings were accurate, but ignored. Bailey explains: As a previous financial crisis recedes over time, it is not unusual to believe that a new era has arrived. In such conditions, Cassandra like warnings that nothing basic has changed and there is a financial breaking point that can have severe economic consequences are ignored. He also cites economics professor Hyman Minsky, who explained that the growth phase of a cycle in credit markets or business activity will end with a sudden, major collapse of asset values (A ‘Minsky moment’). Bailey explains that memories of financial crises recede over time and can be replaced by happier thoughts of a new era arriving. Warning against ‘the trap of complacency’, Bailey says: I can observe this happening with the global financial crisis fifteen years or so on. I do get people telling me that ‘you have solved that one so we can relax’. But the work I set out above on theory and history is timeless. So, let’s not fall into the trap of complacency. To combat these risks, Bailey says, regulators need better surveillance tools – particularly to keep track of the non-bank sector, which he calls “very large, and growing” [these are companies who offer similar services to banks, but aren’t actually banks] And he wraps up with five messages on how to ensure financial stability, starting with the importance of macro-prudential regulation (rather than just a list of potential problems]. System-wide matters and should not disappear amid laundry lists. Second, we must heed Minsky’s warning that memories of financial crises past do recede. Message three is that we have seen a shift in financial intermediation towards non-banks – from money to finance if you like and this presents distinct challenges. Message four is that one of these challenges is the pressing need for new surveillance tools. And message five is that there is also a need for central banks to reconsider their liquidity provision tools to non-banks while not undermining the singleness and uniqueness of money. The IMF’s chief economist has warned that countries such as the UK are treading a “narrow path” as they try to bring debt levels down. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas has been asked about Rachel Reeves’s plans to change the UK’s fiscal rule, to allow more investment in the budget, and about the risks of making too dramatic a change in fiscal policies. He tells the press pack in Washington that the IMF will evaluate the details of the budget once Rachel Reeves has given it, rather than giving judgement now. But he then says that the “broader question” is relevant for many countries, not just UK, who are treading a “narrow path in terms of fiscal consolidation”. Gourinchas explains that when countries have elevated debt levels, when interest rates are high, when growth is “OK but not great”, there is a risk that “things could escalate or get out of control quickly”. He says: So there is a need to bring debt levels down, stabilise then when they are not stabilised, and rebuild fiscal buffers. That is true for many countries around the world. Countries who don’t do that will later find themselves “the mercy of market pressures” that will force an uncontrolled adjustment, Gourinchas warns, adding: At which point you have very few degrees of freedom. You don’t want to get in that position, and the effort to stabilise public debt has to be seen in that contect. But….the other side of the narrow path is that if governments try to do too much too quickly on tax and spending they will have an adverse impact on growth. There is a need for caution, Gourinchas argues, as many countries have essential spending, such as healthcare, investment or on the climate transition. He says: We need to protect the kind of spending that can be good for growth. And he concludes by explaining that achieving this “pivot” is absolutely essential. “We are in a world where there will be more shocks, and countries need to be prepared and need to have some room on the fiscal side to deal with that. The IMF has lifted its growth forecast for the US this year, but trimmed its forecast for China. It now predicts US GDP will rise by 2.8% this year and 2.2% in 2025, up from 2.6% and 1.9% forecast in July. China’s growth forecast for 2024, though, has been cut to 4.8%, down from 5%. The IMF are presenting their new World Economic Outlook report in Washington DC now – you can watch it here: The IMF is sticking with its forecast for 3.2% global growth this year, although predicted growth in 2025 has been revised down from 3.3% to 3.2%. Here’s its new country-specific growth forecasts: Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund believes that the global battle against inflation has largely been won. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, says the decline in inflation without a global recession is “a major achievement”. Speaking as he presents the Fund’s World Economic Outlook, Gourinchas says: After peaking at 9.4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, we now project headline inflation will fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, slightly below the average during the two decades before the pandemic. In most countries, inflation is now hovering close to central bank targets, paving the way for monetary easing across major central banks. But…Gourinchas also fears that downside risks are increasing and now dominate the economic outlook: An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets. Shifts toward undesirable trade and industrial policies can significantly lower output relative to our baseline forecast. Monetary policy could remain too tight for too long, and global financial conditions could tighten abruptly. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has lifted its forecast for UK economic growth this year, as it unveils its new World Economic Outlook. The IMF now predicts that UK GDP will rise by 1.1% this year, up from the 0.7% it forecast back in July. That would make Britain the joint third fastest-growing economy in the G7 this year, in line with France and behind the US which expected to grow by 2.8% and Canada, which is forecast to grow by 1.3%. Italy lags behind with 0.7% growth, Japan with 0.3% and zero growth in Germany in 2024. The Fund still expects the UK to growth by 1.5% next year, “as falling inflation and interest rates stimulate domestic demand”. This upgraded outlook is a boost for Rachel Reeves, ahead of the budget next week. The chancellor has welcomed it, saying: “It’s welcome that the IMF have upgraded our growth forecast for this year, but I know there is more work to do. “That is why the Budget next week will be about fixing the foundations to deliver change, so we can protect working people, fix the NHS and rebuild Britain.” Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies could be ‘stagflationary’ for the US economy, suggests Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. On the other hand, a Democrat clean sweep could lead to another government stimulus package. Ashworth writes: With two weeks to go until election day, Donald Trump has opened a meaningful lead over Kamala Harris in betting markets, although the latest polling suggests the race remains too close to call. To recap, we suspect Trump’s proposed curbs on immigration and new tariffs would be stagflationary. Given the risk of an adverse reaction in bond markets, we are not convinced that Trump would push hard for another large package of deficit-financed tax cuts. A Harris victory would have no impact on our economic forecasts, except in the unlikely event that the Democrats also win complete control of Congress, which would boost the odds of a modest fiscal stimulus. Hat-tip to Deutsche Bank, who have calculated the annualised stock market returns for each US President back to Teddy Roosevelt in 1901. They have calculated that 13 of the last 15 Presidents have presided over annualised returns of between 10% and 17%, and 7 of the last 9 have been in an even tighter 14-17% range. So, while Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are presenting US voters with a stark choice, that decision may not have quite as much impact on the markets than on, say, society. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid argues that it’s “better to be lucky than good”, meaning events are more likely than policy to dictate big-picture market performance under the next President: The big outliers were driven by events that were arguably mostly outside of the control of the sitting President, namely the Depression, the 1973 oil shock, and the double whammy of the post-2000 bubble unwind and the early GFC shock of the George W. Bush administration. Academics have argued that Hoover’s policies exacerbated the Depression, but you only have to look at the returns under Coolidge (the highest of any president) over 1923-29 to see that he likely presided over a bubble that contributed to the subsequent 1929 crash, even if he had left office earlier that year. So Hoover had a challenging legacy to deal with. Mexico’s peso has also been hit by the ‘Trump trade’. Yesterday, the peso fell to more than 20 to the US dollar, a six-week low, before recovering very slightly today to 19.9424 today. Strategists at Danish investment bank Saxo say: The Mexican person weakened to more than 20 pesos to the US dollar yesterday as the options market in peso suggest investors are very nervous about the impact on the peso if Trump should become president. A Trump win next month could be bad news for the euro, especially if Republicans pull off a clean sweep on Capitol Hill. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted today that the the euro could fall as much as 10% in a scenario in which Donald Trump imposes widespread tariffs and cuts domestic taxes after winning November’s election. The euro is currently trading at $1.0827, so a 10% drop implies it would fall below parity against the dollar, as it last did two years ago. European policymakers have been shaken by Trump’s proposal of a 10% tariff on all imported goods, which would hurt Europe’s exporters. Trump has also been promising tax cuts, which would be potentially inflationary – leading to higher interest rates. In a new research note, Goldman’s Michael Cahill writes: Tariffs have a direct influence on exchange rates, so we expect that to be the focus for FX markets in different election scenarios. More specifically, we expect the strongest Dollar response to come from a Republican sweep, which would open the door to larger tariff increases in combination with domestic tax cuts. Cahill predicts a smaller dollar rally if the election results in a divided Republican government, adding: A Democratic sweep or divided Democratic government would likely result in some initial Dollar downside as markets reprice the prospect of more dramatic changes in tariffs. Next week’s UK budget is also influencing the pound. If Rachel Reeves tightens public spending more than expected (despite protests from colleagues), then growth would be weaker… and the Bank of England more likely to lower interest rates. There are reports today that the chancellor is considering increasing taxes paid by online giants such as Amazon.com Inc. That would help fund new support for the high street. Bloomberg reports: Britain’s finance minister is looking at ways to change the existing system of business rates — under which tax bills are based on the value of a firm’s physical premises — so that e-commerce companies such as Amazon pay more, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity discussing plans that haven’t been finalized. She’s examining the move alongside a move to reduce bills on shops, leisure and hospitality, the people said. The markets are likely to become more volatile as the US election approaches, predicts Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, as the polls have been tightening. Haefele says: “As neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that could decide the outcome, the race remains too close for pollsters to call, and we expect volatility to pick up in the coming weeks amid elevated uncertainty. But we also think the potential volatility is unlikely to derail positive equity fundamentals and remind investors not to make dramatic portfolio changes based on expected election outcomes.” The pound has dropped to a two-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling traded as low as $1.2967 this morning, its lowest level since 19 August, as the so-called ‘Trump Trade’ ripples through markets. Neil Wilson, analyst at Finalto, says: Markets think that a Trump win is a) increasingly likely and b) going to be bad for bonds. Markets are also positioning for broad dollar strength - DXY’s rip higher corresponds to the surge in Trump’s odds. Moreover, a Trump win ought to mean tighter Fed policy, or at least that is the thinking. Expectations that UK interest rates will be cut several times in the months ahead have also weighed on the pound. A quarter-point rate cut in November is currently seen as a 98% chance. Jitters in the financial markets are pushing down prices of bonds and shares this morning, and nudging up the cost of government borrowing. In London, the FTSE 100 share index has droppped by 58 points, or 0.7%, to 8261 points, the lowest since last Wednesday. European markets are also in the red, with Spain’s IBEX and Italy’s FTSE MIB both down around 1%. Wall Street is set for a lower open in three hours: Bond yields (the rate of return) are rising, as bond prices fall, adding to losses yesterday. This has pushed the yield on 10-year US Treasury bills up to 4.2%, the highest since late July. UK gilt yields have risen to a one-week high. With the US elections just two weeks away, the possibility of a Donald Trump win is moving markets, argues Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, who says: The “Trump Trade” is back in the driver’s seat, steering everything from bonds to the currency market, with election risks now gripping investor sentiment like never before. The latest data from prediction platforms like Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt now show Trump’s odds of reclaiming the Oval Office shooting past 60%, with talk of a Red Sweep gaining traction. And this isn’t just making headlines—it’s moving markets. The dollar is getting a nice tailwind, rising against everything in its path, while Treasury yields, well, they’re doing their best to keep pace, pushing above 4.20% as the market tries to make sense of what a Trump 2.0 presidency could mean for policy shifts, fiscal spending, and inflation. A Trump victory is likely to lead to a larger budget deficit, corporate tax cuts, and a friendlier regulatory environment, Innes adds. That could lead to faster growth but also lead to higher inflation and interest rates – with Trump also bringing further trade protectionism. Kit Juckes, chief foreign exchange strategist at Société Générale, cites uncertainty over the US election, and concerns that interest rates may not be cut as quickly as expected, saying: There was trouble in bond-land yesterday. US supply, political uncertainty, fear of extended fiscal accommodation and concern that the rate -cutting cycle will be shallower than expected sent US yields back to levels last seen in July. Juckes adds that there is a clear contrast between a US economy fuelled by fiscal largesse (or fiscal irresponsibility?) and pressure for more austerity in Europe (including the UK). Britain’s farmers are urging the government not to hit them with inheritance tax on their agricultural land. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has written a letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling on him to deliver a renewed agriculture budget and confirm the continuation of Agricultural Property Relief (APR). They remind Keir Starmer that he told them in 2023 that rural communities were in his DNA, as he grew up in a rural community. The NFU are concerned by reports that Rachel Reeves could target Agriculture Property Relief (APR), which allows land or pasture that is used to grow crops or to rear animals to be free of inheritance tax, in the budget. NFU President Tom Bradshaw says that reports that the government is considering cutting the agriculture budget, and possibly reviewing APR are incredibly concerning. “We are asking for a renewed multi-year annual agriculture budget of £5.6bn, not because it would be nice to have, but because it is an essential investment to deliver the government’s environmental goals, increase growth and support the economic stability of farm businesses. The loss of APR could mean family farms, who are vital to producing food for the country, providing jobs and looking after our countryside, having to be sold to cover the costs. Changes would amount to a “Family Farm Tax”. It would also have a devastating impact on tenant farmers and new entrants. Motoring and cycling retailer Halfords has warned that UK consumers are wary of making big ticket, discretionary purchases, after reporting no sales growth in the last six months. Halfords told the City that its like-for like sales dipped by 0.1% in the six months to 27th September, following “the UK’s wettest spring since 1986”. And looking ahead, Halfords cautions that the short-term outlook remains “uncertain”, despite pockets of improving consumer sentiment. Graham Stapleton, chief executive officer of Halfords, commented: “While consumers remain cautious in their discretionary spending compounded by uncertainty around the contents of the upcoming Autumn Budget, we have continued to focus on controlling the controllables and I am pleased with our performance in the first half of FY25. There is a small glimmer of good news amid the gloom in this morning’s public finances for the chancellor. The ONS has cut its estimate of public sector net borrowing in the first five months of the financial year by £1.1 billion to £63.0bn. That, though, didn’t prevent borrowing running at £6.7bn above the forecast from the fiscal watchdog (the Office for Budget Responsibility). Philip Shaw of Investec told clients: Although the latest set of data represents a relative positive surprise, it does not shift the dial on the wider fiscal picture. At the halfway point in the financial year, borrowing is tracking some £1.1bn per month above the OBR’s projections in March and although the deficit is on course to undershoot last year’s £121.9bn, its forecast of £87.2bn for this year looks unachievable. Moreover it will certainly not alter the stance of the forthcoming Budget on Wednesday next week when Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil higher taxes. Our Budget and Spending Review preview will be published later this week. Over in Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared that Germany has been hit harder than other world economies by economic headwinds and high interest rates. Scholz is pledging to work with industry to revive growth, telling a conference of the BDA employers’ association. “Inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, strained supply chains - as an industrialised and export-oriented country, we have been hit harder than others.” Scholz said his government’s efforts to reduce bureaucracy, strengthen investment and create affordable, sustainable energy would lift growth, adding that Germany also needs more skilled workers. Inheritance Tax has brought £4.3bn into the government’s coffers since April, which is £400m more than in the same period in the previous financial year, new data from HMRC shows. Rachel Reeves may attempt to raise more from IHT, which raised almost £7.5bn in the last financial year, in the budget. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, says: “Inheritance tax is an absolute cash cow for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which is why it remains in the spotlight ahead of next weeks’ Autumn Budget. No one knows what changes will be announced, but most agree there will be some attempt to milk more revenue from estates. The great thing about inheritance tax from the government’s point of view is that it’s complicated, with a whole host of rules that could be tweaked to boost the tax take. Tweaks could include changes to Business Relief, including on AIM shares, making pensions subject to inheritance tax and extending the time period needed to make gifts inheritance tax free. Labour MP Torsten Bell says the rise in borrowing in September is due to the mismanagement of the economy by the previous government: Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper says: “Today’s figures highlight the difficult position of our public finances after years of mismanagement under the previous Conservative government – but this can’t be an excuse for the Chancellor to make the wrong decisions at the Budget. “We need to see urgent investment in our NHS and public services which have been reduced to their knees and bold action to fix our crumbling schools and hospitals. “The burden of fixing the Conservatives’ mess mustn’t fall on hard working households, but on the big banks, social media companies and oil and gas giants that can afford to pay a small amount of their soaring profits to get our public services back on their feet.” Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: While it is too late for September’s disappointing public finances figures to influence the amount of headroom the OBR will hand the Chancellor in the Budget on 30th October, they do highlight the limited scope the Chancellor has to increase day-to-day spending without raising taxes. That said, if she tweaks her fiscal rules, she will still have room to raise public investment. A group of MPs are urging Rachel Reeves to impose a wealth tax on Britain’s rich in next week’s budget rather than announce spending cuts that would hit the most poor hardest. In a letter to the chancellor, the MPs – including the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell – say she could raise £24bn a year from a 2% tax on wealth above £10m and lay the foundations for a fairer, more sustainable economy. The letter, organised by the campaign group Green New Deal Rising, says in contrast to the general trend, taxes on the very richest are only slightly more onerous than they were in the mid-1960s. “This is deeply unfair and immoral: in an age of climate and economic crises, where public funds are desperately needed, it is necessary that we redress this imbalance. The transformative potential of taxes on extreme wealth is clear, and appetite for them is growing.” Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “Six months into the financial year, Britain is borrowing £6.7bn more than expected at the time of the Budget in March. This reflects central government spending which is £11.5bn higher than anticipated, largely due to public sector pay rises and higher running costs. “Today’s data highlights the scale of the public finances challenges facing the Chancellor as she grapples with overspending today, the need to avoid austerity in the future, and having to fund extra public service spending through tax rises.” The Resolution Foundation explain that this morning’s data shows that central government spending is already £11.5bn above the OBR’s March forecast Most of that comes from spending on good and services, typical higher pay and running costs, which they say “tallies with the £22 billion ‘black hole’ identified by the Treasury back in July.” UK borrowing would have been even higher last month, without Rachel Reeves’s unpopular decision to means-test pensioners’ winter fuel payments, and the end of the extra Pensioner Cost of Living Payment given in 2022 and 2023. Net social benefits paid by central government decreased by £2.0bn in September to £25.7bn. The ONS says: The usual increase caused by the annual uprating of inflation-linked benefits was more than offset by reduced spending on Winter Fuel Payments, partly because of the absence of one-off cost-of-living payments, which were included in September 2023 and partly because of the change in eligibility. Winter Fuel Payments are recorded (on an accruals basis) each September when the eligibility of claimants is determined, although the cash will not be paid until November. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, says the government was right to agree public sector pay deals last summer, even though they pushed up government spending (see earlier post): “We have inherited a £22 billion black hole in the country’s public finances, including no plan to fund pay deals for millions of public sector workers. Strikes cost at least £3 billion last year, so it was the right thing to do to end those damaging disputes. Resolving this blackhole at the Budget next week will require difficult decisions to fix the foundations of our economy and begin delivering on the promise of change.” ONS deputy director for public sector finances Jessica Barnaby says: “Borrowing this month was about £2bn up on last year, making this the third highest September figure on record. While tax revenue increased, this was outweighed by increased spending, partly due to higher debt interest and public sector pay rises.” Here’s a chart showing the key points from September’s UK public finances – the final healthcheck on spending and borrowing before next week’s budget: As a share of the economy, the UK’s national debt is the highest since the early 1960s. The Office for National Statistics reports that public sector net debt excluding public sector banks was provisionally estimated at 98.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of last month. That’s an increase of 4.0 percentage points more than at the end of September 2023. However, it’s a little lower than in August, when the debt/GDP ratio was 98.8%. And that has beren revised down from an initial estimate of 100%. Overall (despite the cut to national insurance) central government tax receipts increased by £3.9bn to £60.5bn in September. That included a £1.8bn increase in income tax, a £800m rise in corporation tax, and a £600m pick-up in VAT receipts. Jeremy Hunt’s cuts to national insurance hit the government’s tax take last month, today’s public finances report shows. The ONS says that compulsory social contributions decreased by £0.9bn to £13.9bn in September, “largely because of the reductions in the main rates of National Insurance in early 2024”. So far this financial year (since April), compulsory social contributions are down by £5.2bn to £82.1bn. Hunt cut 2p off national insurance from January, and followed this up with a second 2p cut in April, which brought the main rate of national insurance contributions (Nics) paid by workers down to 8%. In April, The Treasury says that the average worker on £35,400 will save more than £900 a year as a result of the cuts in January and April. Having promised not to raise taxes on ‘working people’, Reeves can’t really reverse Hunt’s cuts to. But, she has strongly hinted that she could raise employer national insurance contributions. Public sector pay rises also added to government spending – and thus borrowing – last month. Today’s public finances report says: Central government departmental spending on goods and services increased by £2.6bn to £35.9bn, as pay rises and inflation increased running costs Shortly after taking office, the Labour government settled pay claims with junior doctors, and with train drivers, to end industrial action that had been hurting the economy. The cost of servicing the UK’s national debt jumped last month. The interest payable on the UK’s government debt rose to £5.6bn last month, up from just £900m in September 2023. The ONS says: This was because the interest payable in September 2023 was exceptionally low at £0.9 billion, rather than that of September 2024 being unusually high. The interest bill on index-linked debt rises and falls with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s government borrowing rose faster than official forecasts expected in September, in a timely reminder of the challenges facing Rachel Reeves as she prepares to deliver the budget next week. The UK borrowed £16.6bn last month to cover the difference between public sector spending and income. That’s £2.1bn more than in September 2023 and the third highest September borrowing since monthly records began in January 1993. Significantly, it’s also £1.5bn higher than the £15.1bn borrowing forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for September, a sign that higher borrowing is adding to the chancellor’s challenge of raising money for public services without breaking pledges not to raise certain taxes. However, it’s a little lower than the £17.5bn which City economists had forecast. So far this financial year, the UK has borrowed £79.6bn, which is £1.2bn more than at the same point in the last financial year That is £6.7bn more than the £73bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for this period. We’ll get the OBR’s new forecasts in just over a week’s time, after Reeves delivers the budget. The latest public finances show that central government’s receipts were £80.7bn in September, £3.3bn more than in September 2023. But that was overtaken by higher spending; central government’s total expenditure was £93.7bn in September, £5.5bn more than in September 2023. Reeves is heading to Washington DC later this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where finance ministers, central bank governors, thinktank chiefs and charity bosses will discuss the state of the global economy and its ability to generate a higher standard of living. We’ll hear from the IMF, and from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, later today.

          "headline": "With her protest before the king, Lidia Thorpe bursts the warm bubble of nostalgia around the royal visit",
          "bodyText": "As soon as Lidia Thorpe RSVP’d to the royal reception at Parliament House, it would have been clear to those in charge of protocol that there was probably going to be a protest. Perhaps this was why the king and queen and their hosts entered the Great Hall from a door behind the stage and not straight ahead from the foyer, down the centre aisle and right past where Thorpe, dressed in a possum-skin cloak, had taken up an early position at the front of a group of waiting MPs. But making an operational switch was never going to avoid the confrontation altogether, any more than the visit itself can fully erase the sense that Australia’s ties to the monarchy symbolise the nation’s past much more than its future. “You are not our king, you are not sovereign,” Thorpe shouted as she approached the stage before security officials intervened. “You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist. This is not your land. This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king.” As she left the room, she shouted “fuck the colony”. Thorpe’s outburst will probably increase sympathy for the royals among Australians who are ambivalent about the monarchy but believe in at least being polite to guests. From the overwhelming majority of those who have gathered in the streets and in the parliament to see them passing by, the welcome has been warm and genuine, and republican banners few. That particular elephant did also manage to find its way into the reception hall among the guests sipping champagne and trying to capture a sly selfie, albeit less dramatically than the one called Indigenous sovereignty. “You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown,” Anthony Albanese told the king, adding an oblique signpost to Australia’s unfinished business. “Nothing stands still.” Only Peter Dutton was game to tackle the nation’s seemingly increasingly tepid breakaway inclinations head on, and then only as fodder for a joke in the presence of a monarch who clearly doesn’t mind one. “We hope your spirits have been lifted by the response that you’ve received so far, yesterday in Sydney, and today at the War Memorial and indeed here in this hall in this eclectic gathering,” Dutton told the king, from the podium. “People have had haircuts, people have shined shoes, suits have been pressed. And that’s just the republicans.” Australia’s constitutional future didn’t feature in King Charles’s remarks even obliquely – a fair indication that he recognises it has all gone a bit off the boil. Nevertheless, he did lean in to a couple of other issues that have caused domestic political pain in the Antipodes. He acknowledged the “unmistakeable signs of climate change” and the need to confront and not ignore them, praising Australia for “tracking the path towards a better, safer future”. And in the minutes before Thorpe made her protest, he also acknowledged what he described as the nation’s “long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation”. In paying respect to the knowledge of the First Peoples, he wove the two issues together. “It is in all our interests to be good stewards of the world and good ancestors to those who come after us,” he said. “Because we are all connected, both with the global community and with all that sustains life. That is the timeless wisdom of Indigenous people throughout the entire world.” The “horrors of war, death and needless destruction” prompted the king to also declare that “this moment in our history requires both ancient and new thinking”. That’s certainly the challenge for a monarch dropping in to a faraway, slightly ambivalent corner of his empire, armed with nostalgia, empathy and political optimism as the ties to bind it in place. Lidia Thorpe burst that warm bubble on Monday, marching towards the stage and yelling for a treaty, as Albanese and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, leaned over to whisper in nearby respective royal ears. If Thorpe’s protest does nothing else, it serves to remind that while tradition no longer goes unchallenged in this country, sorting out our identity has a long way to go and will be a lot more uncomfortable than one loud, angry voice interrupting a party.

          "headline": "Fox News’s interview of Kamala Harris was grievance theater, not political journalism",
          "bodyText": "Bret Baier started off his Wednesday evening interview with Kamala Harris with a barrage of combative questions about immigration, designed less to elicit substantive answers than to prove what a tough guy the Fox host could be. His aggressive approach was understandable, in a way, since Baier had been under pressure for days from the Donald Trump faithful; they were convinced he was going to go easy on the Democratic nominee for president, and maybe even allow her campaign to edit the interview or see the questions in advance. So, Baier came out guns blazing, barely allowing the vice-president to finish a sentence before jumping in with objections and arguments. After 10 minutes of playing immigration “gotcha”, Baier pivoted to the obvious next subject, airing a video clip in which Harris expressed support for transgender people in prisons. Immigrant hatred. Transphobia. And later, Joe Biden’s age. Baier was running through the Fox News greatest hits playlist. This was grievance theater, not political journalism. But Harris got in her licks. She had her moments. Chiming in afterwards in what some saw as corporate damage control, Baier’s colleagues on Fox News gushed their approval. Martha MacCallum termed Baier’s performance “masterful”, while Dana Perino analyzed the interview as “super good”. I can’t imagine that too many viewers agreed. If they came to it expecting to learn more about Harris’s policies or get a true sense of her character, they would have been disappointed. That wasn’t the gameplan, and it wasn’t the result. But Harris accomplished something anyway. Merely by sitting down with a Fox host, she made a few statements. First, that she is unafraid and is willing to speak to all voters. It’s hard to imagine Donald Trump, these days, submitting to an interview with, say, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC; just this week, he turned away from a CNBC interview, and earlier canceled a CBS News 60 Minutes agreement. Second, Harris did manage to introduce a few snippets of reality to dedicated Fox viewers who probably haven’t been exposed to some of the most troubling criticisms of Trump. “That he’s unfit to serve. That he’s unstable. That’s he’s dangerous,” was how she characterized what millions of Americans are feeling. “And that people are exhausted.” She even was able to mention, at some length, the harsh view of the former commander-in-chief from Mark Milley, who served in two top military roles – including chair of the joint chiefs of staff – during the Trump administration. Milley has called Trump “fascist to the core” and has said that no one has ever been as dangerous to the United States. So maybe this was what one leading expert on Fox News, Brian Stelter, called the Harris campaign’s “Google strategy”. On CNN, Stelter speculated that viewers might hear these comments and go searching online for more, thus piercing the information bubble they’ve been living in. No doubt, the vast majority of regular Fox viewers have their minds made up – they’re sticking with Trump. No matter his mental decline. No matter his felony convictions. No matter the threats he makes or the threats he poses. But there may be a small percentage of the millions who tuned in who – despite all the noise and interruptions – managed to hear a reasonable, intelligent and stable alternative to Trump. Maybe some of them live in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, where the interview was recorded, or in Wisconsin or Michigan. In this coin flip of an election, even that tiny adjustment might make all the difference. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture"

          "headline": "UK inflation surprise opens up wriggle room for lower rates and less painful budget",
          "bodyText": "At a glance, last month’s sharp drop in the headline inflation figure to 1.7% tells the Bank of England all it needs to know when it considers whether to cut interest rates next month. The plunge from 2.2% in August puts the rate of prices growth well below the central bank’s 2% target and back in territory that we last saw in early 2021 – long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices rocketing. It is also welcome news for Rachel Reeves, signalling that the Labour government is about to enjoy a period of low inflation and lower interest rates, giving her the platform to borrow for investment in this month’s budget without spooking financial markets. Lower inflation allows the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to forecast lower departmental spending. For instance, September’s inflation rate will set the increase for working-age benefits next April, saving billions from the welfare bill. As the Bank is now expected to reduce borrowing costs faster, the OBR is also set to cut its outlook for the cost of financing government debt, which ballooned to more than £100bn in the 2023-24 financial year, or almost 10% of total spending. If Whitehall departments can budget for lower inflation and the Treasury can borrow more cheaply, Reeves has a chance to maintain day-to-day spending in real terms while giving longer-term infrastructure spending a boost in her budget on 30 October. It is an illustration of how consequential lower inflation can be. Yes, the chancellor will still need to impose some substantial tax rises, but that could now be couched in a broader narrative that is much more optimistic about the UK than was contemplated until now by many economists or even the Treasury. Much depends on how the OBR views the next five years, and that may not have changed very much since its previous prediction in March. However, the expectation will be that a radical overhaul of the forecasts for inflation and borrowing costs is justified. An essential factor in any calculation outlook for the cost of borrowing is the response of the Bank of England. Before the latest data, investors were 80% sure of a quarter of a percentage point cut to interest rates to 4.75% when policymakers meet next month. Afterwards, those odds tightened further to 90% and hopes are now growing that rates could fall more aggressively next year, as the Bank governor, Andrew Bailey, hinted to the Guardian earlier this month should inflation continue tumbling by more than expected. The financial markets reacted accordingly, with sterling starting to slide on currency markets as soon as the September inflation figure appeared, continuing a fall that has dragged the pound down from $1.34 late last month to below $1.30. Many of the nine officials on the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) are expected to be sceptical of a sustained levelling off in prices. They will point out that the most recent fall in inflation relies on the tumbling oil price and how it feeds through to sectors such as transport. The Office for National Statistics said the average price of petrol fell by 5.5 pence a litre between August and September 2024 to stand at 136.8p. MPC members will be spooked that food prices are continuing to rise strongly when they would usually be affected by the falling cost of transport. The main indicator of more persistent inflationary trends, the core inflation figure that strips out energy and food because they can be volatile, stood at a much higher rate of 3.2%. However, wage growth is slowing, indicating a weakening economic outlook that needs a boost from lower borrowing costs. The oil price is dictated more these days by economic decisions in Beijing than conflict in the Middle East. And China, the world’s largest consumer of oil, is in the midst of a dramatic slowdown brought on by a housing bubble bursting in spectacular fashion. Across the Atlantic, a boom in US economic growth is coming to an end. And the rest of Europe continues to labour under the twin pressures of the Ukraine war and lower demand from its chief export destinations – China and the US. It is in this global context that the MPC will consider where next for interest rates, and which adds to the likelihood they will now fall a bit faster than previously expected. Reeves will lament the lack of drive from the global economy. The compensation is the benefit to the public finances and her plans to claw back more than a decade of lost public investment under the Conservatives."

          "headline": "Starmer is stuck in a British bubble, but it will soon be burst by a turbulent world",
          "bodyText": "There is plenty of action in British politics but not a lot of movement. The government’s unsteady start in office and a Tory leadership contest have kept the Westminster news machine spinning on the only setting it has: frantic lather. Labour’s poll ratings have tanked but that reflects bleak continuity more than change. Voters who were unhappy before the election are no happier. Old blame is unfairly carried over to the new regime. The story of whether the government can lift that mood only really begins with the budget on 30 October. In the absence of a settled tax and spending programme, Keir Starmer’s talk of missions and tough choices is all preamble. But that isn’t the only reason politics is in a state of suspended animation. A week after the budget comes the US presidential election. If Donald Trump wins, no one will still be talking about Rachel Reeves tweaking her borrowing rules. Although I can envisage such an outcome, I doubt I am alone in finding it hard to keep the image in mind without recoiling. The implications are too appalling. Trump despises the principles on which the American republic was founded. His candidacy is an explicit promise to make vindictive, militant and racist ultranationalism the operating doctrine of the world’s most powerful country. He is a much better friend to Vladimir Putin than to any fairly elected leader of any free country. The character of the threat is documented by Trump’s wild caprices in his first term, then proved beyond doubt by his refusal to accept the legitimacy of his defeat. Still about half of US voters disbelieve that evidence or are prepared to disregard it. The insurrection of 6 January 2021 was a near-death experience for US democracy. This time it could die by suicide. Even if Kamala Harris wins, there will be no settling back down to an old equilibrium. The sigh of relief will be short. There will still be a schism running through what used to be definable as a singular “west” and is now contested between two irreconcilable tribes: liberal constitutionalists and nationalist crusaders. The former defend a 20th-century legacy of multilateral treaties, respect for democratic protocol and the rule of law. The latter style themselves as warriors in an existential, civilisational struggle against moral decay through “wokeism” and cultural dissolution in an immigrant horde. With a ballot offering a choice between Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, the Tories have already elected to oppose Starmer from the nationalist crusader camp. But does the prime minister understand that this is the fight he faces, that he is defending a front that stretches across the Channel and the Atlantic? Up to a point. The promised “reset” of relations with the EU is off to a cagey start. Britain’s offer of a new security treaty has been accepted in principle but the substance is a long way off. While the vandalistic Brexit mode of diplomacy is long gone, red lines prohibiting a return to the single market limit talk of economic cooperation to the shallow end of the negotiating pool. Starmer’s reluctance to make any political splash around Europe is understandable, but his continental partners find the inscrutability frustratingly familiar from previous regimes. When there are so many competing pressures on a government, a preference not to debate hard subjects in public easily becomes a decision not to think about them in private either. Labour looks stuck at the vague, aspirational stage of European policy. That is consistent with a certain insularity in Starmer’s vision of Britain’s future. He doesn’t ignore global turbulence, wars on Europe’s periphery or the threat from authoritarian regimes and surging populism. He weaves them into his analysis, while keeping them somehow remote, as devices to illuminate the UK as a lone beacon of political stability. By accepting so many premises of Boris Johnson’s Brexit settlement, Labour has ended up saddled with a weird hybrid, left-leaning, statist version of the Eurosceptic Singapore-on-Thames model. Britain will be a dynamic, free-trading, red-tape-slashing sovereign hub that is also big on social protections and aligned with European rules for some industries. Earlier this week, at an investment “summit” in London, the prime minister elaborated his economic argument in a speech that was subtly revealing without making headlines. He promised a Labour government of predictable sobriety, in contrast to the vandalistic, spasmodic rule of the Tories. Britain, he said, will go back to being the “stable, trusted, rule-abiding partner” it was once reputed to be, and so a worthy location for investment. That makes sense as a pitch to a roomful of corporate executives. It also aligns with everything Reeves says about the essential pursuit of economic growth as a precondition for repairing the public realm, and the need for private sector capital to deliver it. In Starmer’s telling there is then a political dividend. Growth satisfies an appetite for rising living standards and decent services. It proves that moderate, democratic politics works, thereby healing social division and neutralising populism. “Growth leads to a country that is better equipped to come together,” the prime minister said on Monday. “[Growth is] the key ingredient of that ‘great moderation’ we became accustomed to before the financial crash but which together, in partnership, we now have to earn again.” In summoning the spirit of the long boom before the epic bust of 2007-8, Starmer flashed the nostalgic streak common to many members of his liberal constitutionalist tribe. Trauma at the seismic disturbances of Brexit and Trump inevitably contains longing for political certainties that fell into the hole when the old centre ground collapsed. But it is rare for a political leader to pine for the bygone consensus so explicitly. The prime minister does know that times have changed. He makes a case for intervention in markets, industrial strategy and enhanced workers’ rights that was highly unfashionable at the turn of the millennium. But there is still something drily economistic about it all. By providing the foundations for long-term investment, a more secure workforce with higher wages and lower NHS waiting lists will be less angry, and less amenable to recruitment by extremists. It isn’t a bad theory. As a fellow liberal constitutionalist, I want it to be true. But I worry it isn’t enough. The US experience contains a salutary lesson in the limits of economic growth, which has been robust throughout the Biden years without inoculating the population against fascistic politics. Partly that is a problem of distribution and inflation. Plenty of Trump voters don’t feel higher GDP in their pocketbooks. But many are so captured by paranoia and hyper-partisanship that they refuse to believe in a healthy economy as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. Britain is not so polarised. Yet. But looking ahead, there is a potential propaganda chorus of Tories, Reform UK and the anti-Labour press denouncing any incremental improvements delivered by Starmer as inadequate or nonexistent. There will be a symmetrical critique from the radical left. And that is if the growth comes. Reeves’s diligent cultivation of Britain as fertile terrain for investment cannot insulate the country from harvest-wrecking storms that blow in from overseas. This doesn’t have to be a counsel of despair. Starmer has a theory for how Britain might buck sinister anti-democratic trends. He is on the right side of the most important argument of our era. He also has a plan. But it is incomplete and he is intoning it in conference halls to receptive audiences. What he lacks, and badly needs, is an emotional connection with the much tougher crowd that doesn’t believe his kind of politics can ever work. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Harris and Trump are tied in the polls – so I conducted my own less traditional research",
          "bodyText": "Polls! What are they good for? Absolutely nothing, except for driving yourself bonkers. Oh look: Donald Trump is up by two points. Wait, it looks like Kamala Harris is up by five points. Yikes, now Trump is up by one-nineteenth of a point. Now, according to a much discussed NBC News poll that came out on Sunday, Trump and Harris are neck and neck. As the US election draws closer, I have developed a severe case of poll-tigue. Can we just give the damn things a rest already? As we all know, polling is an inexact science at the best of times. More importantly, pretty much all the results of recent Trump-Harris polls have been within the margin of error. The fact that this new poll shows Harris tied with Trump (within the margin of error) while a poll in September showed that Harris was leading Trump (also within the margin of error) might signal that the Harris honeymoon is officially over, but ultimately, it’s not that big a deal. You can scrutinise the numbers ad infinitum, but when it comes down to it, the truth is that nobody knows what is going to happen in November other than it’s (probably) going to be very close. Polls are basically astrology for political nerds at this point. Speaking of which, professional astrologers have their own murky methods for predicting the outcome of elections and they seem just as confused as everyone else. Laurie Rivers, a political analyst turned astrologer with more than 235,000 TikTok followers, told the Economist she sees Harris winning “overwhelmingly”. Meanwhile, Amy Tripp, another influential astrologist, has said Trump will win and she can make “objective” forecasts because she is an Aquarius. I’m not an Aquarius, but I’ve also been dabbling in some “objective” forecasting. I recently devised two unorthodox polling methods, the results of which I will exclusively present in this column. In terms of methodology, both surveys were conducted by me in Philadelphia – the biggest city in Pennsylvania, which is probably the most important swing state in the US. In other words: very serious stuff. Let’s start with Arwa’s Little Walk poll. On Monday I counted all the political signs I saw displayed in people’s houses on the 10-minute walk from my house to my child’s preschool. The final tally? Twenty-six Harris/Walz signs, zero Trump signs and one sign for “Giant Meteor 2024”. (That sign did not belong to me, but I share the sentiment.) In short: a giant meteor has a better chance of winning my little stretch of Philadelphia than Trump. What does this mean? Well, it means I live in a liberal bubble. And, also, that I might be on some kind of neighbourhood watch list now because I peered into so many strangers’ windows. We’ll call the next experiment the Rascal Eats a Treat poll. I put a brown treat in one hand (representing Harris) and a pink treat in another (representing Trump), then I asked my dog Rascal to pick a hand. Much to Rascal’s delight, I conducted this experiment multiple times. And guess what? Every single time he picked the Harris indicator. At first I thought that meant my dog was a savant trapped in a chihuahua’s scruffy little body. Then, of course, I realised Rascal could smell the difference between the treats and simply preferred one artificial flavour to the other. As an objective Aries, I will admit that this poll would probably not stand up to serious scrutiny. That said, the Rascal treat test is not quite as ridiculous as it might sound. The Busken Bakery in Cincinnati has been running a presidential Cookie poll since 1984. It sells cookies with candidate’s faces on them and the highest-selling cookie candidate has won nine out of 10 elections (2020 was the outlier). A random bakery has been right just as many times as Allan Lichtman, the distinguished professor who is famous for his 13 “keys” to the White House. (Lichtman got 2020 right but 2000 wrong.) And the bakery has certainly done better than many pollsters. In all seriousness – and before the Guardian gets inundated with complaints from the Association for Preserving the Reputation of Political Polling – I should clarify that polls aren’t a complete waste of time. The latest NBC poll is yet another reminder that the US is a deeply divided country and this election will be won on the margins. And my own polls show that Rascal is a dog of discerning taste. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Taylor Swift police escort claims: how much of a problem is this for Labour?",
          "bodyText": "Ministers are struggling to shake off claims that they pressed the Metropolitan police into giving Taylor Swift a motorbike escort as she travelled to Wembley for her sold-out summer shows. Downing Street and Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, have repeatedly insisted the Met makes decisions independently from politicians. How much of a problem is this for Labour? What’s the background? For weeks, senior Labour politicians have been dogged by criticism over gifts and hospitality declared by Keir Starmer and other frontbenchers. The prime minister declared more free tickets and gifts than other major party leader in recent times, with his total now topping £100,000, including £4,000 of hospitality at a Swift concert and £698 worth of Coldplay tickets in Manchester. It looked as though Labour had managed to finally draw a line under the accusations with a vow to close a loophole that meant different rules applied to what ministers had to declare. But last week the Sun reported that Khan and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had been involved in talks over providing extra security for Swift’s Eras Tour shows at Wembley, after initial reservations from the police. The Met is reported to have thought such a move would breach its longstanding protocols. The talks came after Swift had pulled out of three planned concerts in Vienna after Austrian police foiled a terror plot. It is understood that Swift’s mother, who doubles as her manager, wanted a police escort from where the singer was staying to Wembley and threatened to cancel the London concerts if one was not provided. The newspaper claimed that the Met’s special escort group were at first reluctant to give Swift a blue-light escort, usually given to senior royalty and politicians. It is VVIP protection that even Prince Harry was repeatedly denied. Cooper attended one of the concerts with her husband, Ed Balls. This weekend the Sunday Times reported that the attorney general, Richard Hermer, told the Met he would provide it with “legal cover” to provide an escort. He is not known to have attended one of Swift’s concerts. All this has led to claims that the Met was pressed into giving Swift the security because of “undue influence” from senior politicians who attended the concerts. Do celebrities routinely get police escorts? It is not unusual for event organisers who oversee events on the scale of Swift’s summer tour to work with police forces on security arrangements. Whether or not the celebrities get police escorts is linked to the current threat level and how many people are due to attend a specific event. Transport for London (TfL) data shows that exits at Wembley Park tube station between June and August, around the time of Swift’s shows, were up 18.2% on the same period in summer 2019. Wembley Park ranked in the top 5% out of 434 stations operated by TfL, ahead of many prime central London locations. Swift’s concerts are said to have generated approximately £300m from tourists, meaning any cancellation would have represented a huge loss to London’s economy. What was the evidence of a threat against Swift? Swift was forced to cancel three shows in Vienna in August after two people were arrested on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by Islamic State. Weeks before this threat was revealed, Swift expressed her “complete shock” when three children were killed and seven people were left in a critical condition in an attack at a dance and yoga class inspired by her music in Southport, Merseyside. A Downing Street source told the Sun that Swift’s August concerts were “a major event for the country”. What role did the home secretary and attorney general play? Given the number of security incidents linked to Swift at the time, there were high-level meetings held between government, police and event organisers to discuss safety. The government has insisted it is right for ministers to work closely with other agencies to ensure major events can take place securely. The Times reported on Monday night that Scotland Yard had sought legal advice from the attorney general about providing a blue-light escort. He was asked to intervene after the Met warned that granting the US pop star “VVIP” protection would breach its longstanding protocols. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer previously said the decision was “solely an operational decision for the police”. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, defended Cooper’s involvement. “When you have major events, whether in London or in other parts of the UK, the home secretary will be involved in a conversation where there is a security risk,” she said. Nandy rejected the suggestion there had “been any kind of wrongdoing or undue influence”. Is this a storm in a teacup? Given the nature of the security discussions, the ministers and politicians concerned insist they are unable to divulge what was said in the meetings. This may allow the row to continue to bubble, and the Tories are certainly capitalising on this."

          "headline": "Westminster’s reliance on Elon Musk’s X is ‘totally wrong’, says Labour MP",
          "bodyText": "Westminster needs to wean itself off X, a close ally of Keir Starmer has said, as he suggested that Elon Musk was deliberately manipulating its algorithm to boost his own political and personal interests. Josh Simons, the MP for Makerfield and former head of the Starmerite thinktank Labour Together, said he believed the British political class was dangerously addicted to the platform, formerly known as Twitter. Simons maintains an active X profile, but says he is keen not to “overuse” it. His comments reflect a growing concern among Labour MPs about the impact of X after the summer’s riots, during which misinformation spread rapidly on the platform. But they also threaten to exacerbate tensions between the government and the company, with Musk continuing to attack Starmer over ministers’ response to the violence. Simons, a technology expert who wrote a book on artificial intelligence, told the Guardian in an interview: “I think that Twitter’s algorithm, its ranking model, which determines what we see on Twitter when we open it, has manifestly changed since Elon Musk took over. Not least because I don’t think I’ve ever liked anything that he said ever, and I see loads of him all the time, and I really don’t want to. “I’ve even said: ‘Show less of this,’ and there he is, every time. And that’s a sure sign – when a founder and owner of a company, you see more of them on an algorithm, despite not liking them – [of] something going on.” He added: “I think that it is totally and completely wrong and harmful to British democracy that the Westminster bubble gets to know each other through a ranking model designed by a man who’s spending his life campaigning for Donald Trump. I think that it’s shortsighted of us all.” X did not respond to a request to comment. Relations between the government and the social media company have been tense since the summer’s riots, which experts say were fanned by online misinformation regarding the identity of the attacker who killed three children in Southport. As the violence escalated, Musk posted repeatedly about them, including one video of riots in Liverpool, which he annotated with the quote “civil war is inevitable”. Downing Street publicly criticised those comments, saying they had “no justification”, and in turn was greeted with another volley of angry posts from Musk. The X owner renewed his attack on the Labour government last month after not receiving an invitation to Monday’s international investment summit. “I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles [sic] in order to imprison people for social media posts,” he posted, in apparent reference to the government’s early release scheme. Many Labour MPs have quit X and set up profiles on rival platforms such as Bluesky instead. Simons, who used to work for Meta on its AI programme and is now standing for election to the Commons technology select committee, said he thought the new generation of MPs were more sceptical about the platform than their predecessors. “The mood is changing quite radically,” the 31-year-old said. “I actually think Twitter has a bit of a sort of Boomers/Gen-Xer thing about it. It’s interesting that among the new intake, quite a lot of people are quite sceptical about it. It doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t ever use it, not least because it gives us another tool to be seen on.” He also said he believed the debate over AI had been dominated for too long by older politicians who did not grow up steeped in technology in the way his own generation did. Such people, he said, were often either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about how the technology could change the way government works. The former prime minister Tony Blair and the former Conservative leader William Hague have been two of the most outspoken advocates for the widespread adoption of AI by the public sector. The former prime minister Rishi Sunak has spoken positively about its potential but also warned about its “existential risk” to humanity. Simons said: “There is a generation [that] didn’t actually grow up with data and technology, and they have these very simplistic, reductivist, often either utopian or apocalyptic ways of thinking about the future of the state or public services or the economy in relation to technology. “AI can often be a distraction from going one level deeper into the technology, in order to understand its policy and political implications better.”"

          "bodyText": "Just popping back briefly to highlight this superlative comment from MikeMoonlight: “Pete Wicks is dancing to Oasis next week? He’ll get a score of 22 from the judges on Saturday but owing to dynamic scoring, that’ll rise to a perfect 40 by Sunday.” Thanks for watching along with me and making this one of the happiest corners of the internet each weekend. Our dancefloor dozen now progress to the fifth live show, which airs next Saturday at 6.25pm on BBC1. Meet you back here for cha-cha-chat. In the meantime, let muscle memory kick in and keeeeep dancing! Goodnight and have a great week. Finally, on the Wynne Evans and Katya Jones farrago, Pancake01 says: “I think something must have happened. Wynne standing with his hands behind his back, like he’s been told to.” Nottinghamfella adds: “I know Katya &amp; Wynne put a statement out but there is a definite edge here. It’s like he daren’t go near her. Even when their names were announced, he kept his hands behind his back and barely looked at her. It seems neither of them are really sure what to do.” On that Taylor Swift group number, SparklingDormouse says: “Bah humbug. Professional dance &amp; special effects. Boo!Didn’t like the darkness. What’s the point of having all those dancers when you can’t see them? AND the freezing thing. Very annoying.” Paperview adds: “Mandy Moore is an amazing choreographer. I love her work. But that professionals’ dance was the equivalent of an idea scribbled on a scrap of paper and left, forgotten in a drawer until someone called for a last-minute idea. It should have stayed in the drawer.” On Paul Merson going through, Phoebe says: “I loved the delayed joy from Karen and Paul after they were declared to be through to next week. They were genuinely shocked. Glad Paul is through as he seems to have got over the ‘embarrassment’ of dancing and realised that he CAN do it and is now enjoying it. A proper Strictly journey.” On Snow Patrol’s performance, JoMK73 says: “Outstanding dance from Lauren and Kai. Lauren really is incredible and they make a nice partnership.” tomatopincushion adds: “Love Snow Patrol but I’m not OK with them looking older. In my head, they only exist as they did when I was 16, listening to them while revising for GCSEs. Twenty years ago. Bah.” On Shayne Ward’s shock appearance in the dance-off, Emilyscatnaps says: “Ooooh, the curse of going first for Shayne?” tomatopincushion says: “Oh Shayne. Not a huge surprise, he’s pretty forgettable.” IvanTiger adds: “Shayne?? Must be his yellow cozzie as his dancing was good.” Time for a (Taylor) swift round-up of your comments. On Nick and Luba’s departure, wtrukus says: “They deserve to be in the dance off but also when a celebrity wears bear ears, you know they’re going out.” IvanTiger says: “Nick’s no surprise. He’ll be able to go home to bed and recover now.” Emilyscatnaps says: “I think Shayne’s leg action is better ‘tonight’. Bodes badly for the little bear with the hard stare.” YodaknowsAll says: “Motsi ‘I am voting for Shane and Nancy as they were on a whole other level’. Talk about kicking a man when he’s down.” geordiehinney22 adds: “Dear Luba is such a competent person, game for anything, especially on ITT. She’s the one you’d want on your desert island. How I wish she could get a decent dance partner.” It’s been another all-too-brief contest for long-suffering Luba Mushtuk. The St Petersburg-born pro tends to be paired with tall but relatively unpromising celebrities. This was the third time she’s failed to last a month, having been booted out early with rower James Cracknell and NFL player Jason Bell. She was then benched for two years, before reaching mid-series last year with actor Adam Thomas. That remains her best run in seven years on the show. Now she had to choreograph not one but two numbers around Nick Knowles’ various ailments. She’ll be praying for another soap actor or similar next year. Preferably one with a clean bill of health. TV viewers can now flip to Nothing Like A Dame on BBC2, The Dog House on Channel 4 or Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? on ITV1. At 9pm, there’s new Welsh noir Cleddau (which translates as The One That Got Away) on S4C/BBC iPlayer, legal drama Showtrial on BBC1 or The Poisoning: How To Kill Your Husband on C5. Don’t go getting any ideas, mind you. Film-wise, 12 Angry Men is just starting on Sky Arts. The Lady In The Van airs at 10.30pm on BBC1. At 11.55pm, get in the Halloween mood with The Wicker Man on BBC2. Oh no! Oh Jesus Christ! If it wasn’t for his unlucky run of injuries - first to his arm, then his knee - DIY SOS host Nick Knowles might have lasted a few more weeks. Instead, he was undone by the Charleston, which isn’t the dance you want when you’ve got a sore leg. This year’s oldest male celebrity at 62 is a strapping fellow, so bouncing and swivelling on a crocked joint can’t have been easy, let alone twice. He’s been spotted out and about in a knee brace, so it’s clearly giving him grief. Still, at least he got to belatedly perform the Paddington dance dedicated to his 10-year-old son Eddie. As judge Motsi Mabuse said last night, most celebrities who miss a show through injury never return. Nick bowed out in the ballroom, rather than leaving off-screen with a whimper. The craggy-faced handyman was game enough but something of a dad dancer. The three routines he got to complete - a hi-vis jive, a one-armed American smooth and that Paddington plod - never scored more than 21 points. Once he was drawn against Shayne Ward in the dance-off, the writing was on the hastily erected MDF wall. However, when he wasn’t on the physio’s table, he clearly enjoyed his month in the sparkly Strictly bubble. Rest up, get fit and go well, Knowlesy. Perhaps the most fortunate celebrity tonight is Dr Punam Krishan. After her error-strewn jive, she finished bottom of the scoreboard, a point below Nick Knowles. Considering she scored 10 fewer than Shanye Ward, she can count herself lucky. The media medic was saved from the dance-off by viewer votes - a hangover, perhaps, from that milestone Bollywood moment last week. That was the only time she’s escaped the lower reaches of the leaderboard. The jiving GP needs to raise her game if she’s going to make it into November. Indeed, all the hoofers who scored fewer points than Shayne will be breathing a sigh of relief. Paul Merson and Pete Wicks especially, but also Sam Quek and Sarah Hadland, who has previously looked like a potential finalist but had a poor night. Bear with, bear with. Nick’s exit was no great surprise. What will raise plentiful eyebrows was the unexpected appearance of Shayne Ward in the dance-off. He finished joint fifth on the judges’ scoreboard, a hefty 10 points off the bottom. Six celebrities scored fewer. However, Shayne failed to win enough public votes and plummeted into the bottom two. Was it the fabled “curse of the middle of the leaderboard”, with everyone assuming he was safe? Was it because he danced first on Saturday, the so-called “slot of death”, meaning his routine got forgotten when it came to voting time? Or is he not connecting with viewers? Some have found his uneasy combination of cockiness and fragility hard to warm to. Then again, perhaps nobody could bring themselves to vote for those ghastly custard yellow get-ups. That will teach Vicky Gill’s wardrobe department for using up spare fabric from the Minions routine in Movie Week. Despicable corner-cutting. As the departing couple take a final twirl around the ballroom to I Try by Macy Gray (tune), the credits roll and the other couples crowd in for backslaps and air-kisses. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her voice cracking with emotion, his pro partner Luba Mushtuk says: “I’ve never met someone as determined as you. I remember you saying that if you do your best, you’ll be very happy. I think you did more than your best. Thank you.” In his exit interview, Nick Knowles tells Tess: “I’ve been surprised by how much I’ve loved doing this and by two things that happen. One is how much you care each week. The other is how much you don’t want to let down your partner. The only reason I could do this is simply because of Luba’s changes, she’s been amazing. “I should say thank you also to all the background staff, the physios, all the people that have actually got me through this week, and to all of my fellow competitors who have been absolutely astounding. Beautiful people. There are some amazing dancers up there and I will love watching the rest of the series.” Nicely said. Feel free to watch along with the Guardian’s liveblog, Nick. I hear it’s quite good. No surprisingly, it’s unanimous. Head judge Shirley also would’ve chosen to save Shayne and Nancy, saying “both pairs upped their game”. The majority vote means that Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk become this year’s third couple to depart the dancefloor. Shayne and Nancy, saying “both couples improved but they had greater clarity of technique”. Shayne and Nancy, saying “they were at a different level”. Shayne and Nancy, saying “they kept time and it was clean, even though Nick improved”. The judges each scored Shayne two points more than Nick last night - except Craig, who saw a three-point difference. Surely Nick didn’t do enough to close such a yawning gap? Nick Knowles and his dance partner Luba Mushtuk reprise their prison-set Charleston to Rain on the Roof from Paddington 2. Channelling Hugh Grant and a Peruvian bear with Ben Whishaw’s voice. The judges said last night that it was slow-paced and too placed, lacking swivel and a sense of wild abandon. It notched 21 points, a huge nine fewer than Shayne, so Nick will need to show miraculous improvement. Shayne Ward and his pro partner Nancy Xu have another go at their bowling alley-themed cha cha cha to Ain’t No Love (Ain’t No Use) by Sub Sub feat Melanie Williams. The judge said last night that it had good groove and strong connection but Shayne needed to work on his arm co-ordination. It scored 30 points, nine more than Nick, so surely all Shayne needs to do is not go A over T and he should be fine. And hey, at least it gives us another chance to enjoy this 90s dance banger. Musical interlude now from Celtic indie rockers Snow Patrol, performing their latest single Everything’s Here and Nothing’s Lost. Kai Widdrington and Lauren Oakey provide choreographic accompaniment. He’s brought in some fruit. Not the promised pears, though. More Clauditorium chat with the relieved couples. La Winkle’s an Oasis superfan, so is mad for it. Dr Punam is relieved and grateful to go through. Sam Quek is missing a friend’s wedding because she’s still in the contest against all expectations. Nikita Kuzmin has another go at singing next week’s song. That was a lot. Sarah Hadland’s cat Percy makes his weekly cameo. Well, he was second from bottom on the scoreboard and hasn’t been saved by viewer votes. Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk are consigned to the dance-off for the first time. Is his injured knee up to a second performance? And has he got a hope in hell against Shayne Ward? So are Pete Wicks, Sam Quek, Dr Punam Krishan and Sarah Hadland. Now to find out who will face Shayne in the dance-off. Fasten your lurid yellow leisurewear. Shirley sings the praises of Chris McCausland. Rightly so. Craig Revel Horwood demonstrates figure-of-eight hip action. Even Shirley Ballas, the trademarked Queen Of Latin, is impressed. They’re shocked that Shanye Ward’s in the dance-off, like many of us. Anton Du Beke pretends to be upset that he didn’t get to do a demo time for Montell Douglas. The judges decamp to the Clauditorium to form a semi-circle and take a closer look at last night’s routines. That was rather lovely, I thought, if a bit baffling story-wise. We open with a group routine from the professional troupe. It’s set to Taylor Swift’s 2015 sultry synth-pop ballad Wildest Dreams and choreographed by Emmy-winning Mandy Moore. She’s known for her work on US shows So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing Wth The Stars, plus choreographed 2016 film La La Land, Shania Twain’s La Vegas residency and Tay Tay’s Eras Tour. She’s also confused so often with actress and singer Mandy Moore that her social media handle is “Nope Not Her”. Nikita Kuzmin and Karen Hauer play the leads. They’re in hot pink, while everyone else is in greyscale. Visually striking, like a pop video. Romantic contempo-waft with sped-up segments. After Aljaz teases fellow pro Nikita over his Shakira faux-pas, he reveals that they’ll be performing to Florence &amp; The Machine’s Dog Days Are Over. Tune. Chris McCausland says of Jamie Borthwick’s family: “It must be nice for them to see you on the telly without having to watch EastEnders.” Chris is delighted to be doing a slow ballroom dance next week after two fast Latin numbers. Up on the balcony banquette with the happy couples who are safely through to next week, Montell Douglas reveals that they’re “bringing it back home” with a party dance. Paul Merson and Karen Hauer are shocked to have dodged the dance-off. “Honestly, when Tess called our names, I was thinking, who are Paul and Karen?” he says. Bless that man. Well, that’s a shocker. He’s tumbled from mid-table into the bottom two. Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu must dance again for survival. Perhaps the fashion police intervened. Wynne Evans and Katya Jones are safely through, despite hand-around-waistgate. Also returns to the dancefloor are Montell Douglas, Jamie Borthwick and Tasha Ghouri. Well, obv. Strap in, it’s time for loooong pauses, relieved embraces and ostentatious thanks yous down the camera. Our 13 couples await their fates. Shayne Ward’s custard couture, Paul Merson’s tailcoat and Gorka Marquez’s waxed chest still present and correct. They’ve also repaired Sarah Hadland’s corsage, which she tore in her post-dance excitement last night. We’ve all done it. A recap of Saturday night’s action on-screen now. Paul Merson channels Fred Astaire! Pete Wicks channels Danny Zuko! Montell Douglas’ gracefully gaw-jus Viennese waltz! Chris McCausland performs more miracles! Perfect 10s for Tasha Ghouri! Behold our two-headed hosting hydra, so a quick frockular face-off. Tess Daly is in a one-shouldered black jumpsuit. Claudia Winkleman is in a black sparkly minidress. Claud wins, making it a clean sweep for La Winkle this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. One of these smiley duos will be damp-eyed in approximately 35 minutes. But which, I beseech thee? Call any stragglers in from the kitchen. Wake up any post-roast nappers. We’re about to head over to Elstree Studios… Musical guests on the results show are Dundee indie rockers Snow Patrol. Not to drop names but frontman Gary Lightbody is an old mate of mine. Clang! Light up, light up the dancefloor, as if you have a choice. Just five minutes now until the glittery curtain comes up… Last night saw the first maximum scores of Strictly 2024, with Tasha Ghouri and Aljaž Škorjanec notching three perfect marks for their Charleston. No prizes for guessing which judge declined not to raise his maximum paddle. Frankly, I was with Craig. Not perfect, too soon - and that Coachella/selfie stick theme deserved to knock off a point. Talking of 10s, that’s how many minutes are left to wait… On BBC1 right now is Antiques Roadshow from the Ulster Folk Museum near Belfast. Glasses for hens! Sounds like something Bob Mortimer would make up on Would I Lie To You? I wonder if one day, people will find a dusty old “10” paddle in Craig Revel Horwood’s loft? Fifteen minutes until the red spotlight of doom gets switched on… A fleeting incident caused a right kerfuffle online last night. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed that on the balcony, Wynne Evans slipped his arm around partner Katya Jones’ waist but she pushed it down onto her hip. She also apparently ignoring his attempt at a high-five. As speculation grew about the significance of these awkward interactions, Evans has since said they were “messing around” and apologised for any confusion. Jones insisted it was a “silly joke”. All rather strange. I wonder if The Great Unpleasantness this summer means everyone is on high alert for the merest sign of tension between celebrities and professionals? Is Katya deliberately distancing herself from male partners since Seann Walsh-gate? Or do we reckon something is rotten in the House of GoCompare? The glitterball will soon start spinning again… Tay Tay fans assemble! Tonight’s group routine is a Taylor Swift number, choreographed by no less than Mandy Moore, who worked on the Eras tour. Not long to wait now, Swift superfans… It was touch and go whether he’d be fit to dance or forced to withdraw from the competition but Nick Knowles got late medical clearance to perform last night. The DIY SOS host and his pro partner Luba Mushtuk duly delivered the Paddington-themed Charleston they’d originally planned for Movie Week. However, it still left Nick just a single point off the foot of the leaderboard. Will viewers feel sorry for the injury-plagued presenter and save him from the dance-off? It’s 25 minutes until we’re back in the ballroom… Coming into this weekend, bookmakers’ odds-on favourite for elimination was former footballer Paul Merson. However, he played it straight for the first time and pulled a surprisingly debonair Fred Astaire quickstep out of the sparkly bag. It notched his first seven and lifted him out of the bottom two on the scoreboard. But will that be backed up by viewer votes? Half an hour until glitter o’clock… Somebody’s hoofing adventure is about be over. Good evening and welcome to the third elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I’m Michael, your our rhinestones-and-Spanx correspondent for tonight’s results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another couple bite the ballroom dust. Following last night’s high-quality (if erratically scored) hoofing, our 13 pro-celebrity pairs are set become a dancefloor dozen. The judges’ scores have been combined with the public vote and the bottom two will take to the ballroom floor again, bidding for survival. So who’s in danger? Dr Punam Kirshan was left propping up the scoreboard with Nick Knowles second from bottom, just a point above. But will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Paul Merson, Pete Wicks or even Sarah Hadland could be in for a nervy night. It’s showtime at the very slightly later time of 7.20pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and mild-to-medium snark. So snuggle up on this chilly autumnal evening and see you on the sofa. As always, I’d also love to hear from you. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for dance discussion. I’ll quickstep down there whenever I can to gauge your reactions and report on your musings. Yes, 13 will prove unlucky for some. Nearly time to staaaaaart eliminating! That concludes Saturday’s sequin-spangled, yellow-trousered liveblog but we’ll be back in ballroom hold tomorrow. Meet you right here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I’ll press “go” on the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so I very much hope you’ll rejoin me then. In the meantime, I’m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so do rumba-walk over and say hello. Thanks for watching along with me and your ever-excellent company. Meet you here for the third elimination tomorrow. And in the meantime, as is traditional: keeeeeep dancing! Nighty night. For me, Tasha Ghouri was overmarked. A near-perfect 39 points, before we’re even one-third of the way through the contest, is too much. Whither the improvement and the J-word (journey)? Down the bottom, did Paul Merson save his skin by pulling that debonair quickstep out of the bag? Dr Punam vs Nick Knowles for the dance-off would be the just outcome on Sunday night. A special shout-out to my sparkly sidekick tonight, 12-year-old Strictly superfan May, who has been helping me keep an eye on the messageboard and giggling away at all your comments. The future of hoofing punditry is in safe hands. Indeed, Somersetlass says: “Can we have May as the new Strictly judge next year?” Thanks for all your help, May! I owe you some extra pocket money, money, money. Final comment round-up now. TeeDubyaBee says: “I love Paul Merson’s presence in the background upstairs - like a slightly confused uncle at a kid’s birthday party. RegWhelk says: “A week that will be remembered for bonkers scoring, the first tens and Paul Merson’s quickstep that seemed to come out of nowhere. It’s anyone’s guess who will be in the dance-off but the good doctor must be worried.” jagadox says: “Pete Wicks has been smiling and apparently enjoying his dancing. Has he ruined his brand as a miserable git?” TeeDubyaBee says: “I’m surprised at how much I’m liking Mr P Twix.” diamondcat adds: “I do wish Craig would do something about the back of his hair. It looks like the rats have been nibbling at it.” Some comments on tonight’s costumes now. Heartticker says: “What has happened to wardrobe? Always loved the gorgeous Strictly costumes but this week looks like they’ve been cobbled together from a child’s dressing-up box.” MartGray says: “If you’re going to have Wyn Evans do a tango, at least paint him orange.” GreatIsMyNewt says: “I’m just wondering if wardrobe recycled Anne Widdecombe’s demented canary outfit for Shayne. But glad to see that Gorka has run out of buttons again.” whistledownthewind says: “I’m trying to work out whether Motsi’s hair is tied in a reef or granny knot.” MollyintheFolly adds: “Why has Motsi come out in her bathrobe?” On Sarah Hadland, FloraBelle says: “Loved Sarah and Vito. Shaping up to be one of my favourites this season. Even though I keep half expecting Miranda to stage bomb every time she dances.” Somersetlass says: “Sarah and Vito’s partnership is just lovely. Sarah seemed a little tentative dancing on her own at the start, but once she was in hold, it was beautiful.” jagadox adds: “I enjoyed Vito and Sarah. A possible finalist combo?” On Jamie Borthwick, EastofStratford says: “Poor Jamie, he suffers from ESDL (Englishman shorts disaster legs). It is incurable but a better cut of shorts can do a lot to divert the eye.” On JB Gill, SparklingDormouse says: “Pretty good rumba from JB &amp; Amy. Good movement and a good connection between them.” On Punam’s jive, Heartticker says: “It didn’t really get going for me. A bit flat-footed and a few mistakes but an extra point for Gorka’s abs.” FascinatingFlamenco adds: “Messy. Jive is meant to be sharp and incisive and that was soft and all over the place. Loved Punam’s dance last week, but this one just wasn’t her.” On Paul Merson, Somersetlass says: “How lovely to see Paul doing a serious dance. I really enjoyed that - ballroom has brought out the best in him. Fairly light on his feet, and although he still looked rather terrified, he’s made such progress. This is what Strictly is all about.” jagadox adds: “Paul and quickstep seemed like a contradiction. And turned out to be - if not quite Fred Astaire then not yomping over a muddy field in wellies. A decent and somewhat surprising effort.” Sparkling Dormouse says: “Really classy from JoJo &amp; Montell. Lovely from them. Best so far tonight and the first one deserving a nine!” FloraBelle adds: “Montelle and JoJo were just gorgeous there. Such elegant lines and her smile was infectious. Beautiful dress, cute hair ribbon and loved the staging too.” On Chris McCausland, FloraBelle says: “Never mind Men At Work. Chris works like a Trojan. As someone who is visually impaired myself, I am in awe of both him and Diane. Just wow.” Vicc says: “Chris and Dianne are amazing. Those lifts. The fact that he doesn’t miss a cue which would normally be a visual one. Impressive to put it mildly!” Heartticker adds: “Chris and Dianne impressed once again. Diane is an amazing teacher. I think she’s fabulous and has been a little underrated in the past.” On Tasha’s Charleston, SparklingDormouse says: “Points off for the selfie stick and Aljaz over-emoting. Apart from that, amazing. Can’t tell who the professional is. Just not getting the improvement element as she’s too good to start with!” Gardener_Maidhc says of Pete Wicks’ quickstep: “Faux quiff short hair really suits Pete. The leading arm elbow drops a bit in hold which throws his posture off but great styling and a good dance. Not my favourite but my favourite of his so far.” On Nick Knowles’ miraculous rise from the physio’s table, Heartticker says: “Nick Knowles just danced a very strange Charleston, I thought. I know he’s had an injury or two but a bit boring in my opinion.” whistledownthewind says: “Good to see that Nick Knowles WILL dance tonight. Mind you with his current luck, he’ll possibly sprain his ankle on his way down the stairs during the intro.” IvanTiger says: “Nick needs more swivel, though he’s in time and has arm elegance.” jagadox adds: “Glad to see Nick back. Enjoyed the dance too, although perhaps not the greatest Charleston we’ve ever seen.” Time to take the temperature of your comments. Lots of talk of overmarking. ryfford says “Week 4 and 10s, FFS. PERLEASZE!!!!” VirgilHilts says: “It’s week 4 on Strictly and the theme is Insane Overmarking!” irreverentnurse says: “Ridiculous scores for Jamie.” Petebail says: “Overmarking won’t do Jamie any favours in the public vote.” fernzette adds: “What’s going on with the scoring? Overmarked for the dances I’ve seen so far. Oh and Tess looks like a pack of Parma violets unraveling.” Viewers can now flip to BBC2 for 40 Hidden Music Treasures At The BBC or it’s Angela Rippon Night on BBC4 to celebrate her 80th birthday - and right now, she’s looking back at her Come Dancing days. At 10.30pm, TV’s Greatest: Black on the Box on Channel 5 pays tribute to the likes of Lenny Henry, Floella Benjamin and Trevor McDonald. If you fancy a film, choose at 9pm between Heat on Legend, Face/Off on Great Movies, 300 on 5Star or Last of the Mohicans on Film4. At 10pm, The Sixth Sense is on MTV. At 10.30pm, Jordan Peele’s Us is on BBC1. As Nick Ross used to say, don’t have nightmares. They’re the most coveted made-up awards this side of Coachella festival. Here are this week’s gong-grabbers… Best dance: Tasha and Alijaž’s three 10s have to clinch it but Montell Douglas’ dreamy waltz and Paul Merson’s first sevens run her close. Worst dance: Nick and Luba’s lumpen Charleston. Dr Punam’s jive scored one fewer point but had more to offer. Best music choice: Pop divas Shakira and Lizzo. A good week overall for Dave Arch and his band. Their version of I Won’t Dance by Fred Astaire had serious swing, too. Worst music choice: Men At Work. Sorry, Dianne’s dad. Best outfit: A three-way tie between Sam’s samba dress, Karen’s pink beaded quickstep frock and those 50s outfits for “Petita”. Worst outfit: Shayne and Nancy’s sickly yellow monstrosities. To add insult to injury, they reused the fabric for Chris McCausland’s trousers. Best judges’ comment: Craig was on top form, from imitating Shirley (“You might learn something”) to mocking Anton’s grunts (“The espresso’s kicked in, I see”). Worst VT: Jamie and Michelle dahn the old East End snooker hall. Awkz. Best Claudia quip: I enjoyed “Pete gets a tattoo – his first” but the prize goes to Claud holding up her hand to Vito: “It wasn’t a high-five, it was a halt.” Unsurprisingly after the first 10s of the series, Tasha Ghouri tops the scoreboard by a distance, with Jamie Borthwick and Wynne Evans in joint second spot. Dr Punam Krishan is way down at the bottom, with Nick Knowles just above. As always, though the viewer vote helps decide which two couples are consigned to tomorrow night’s dance-off. It could be a nervy wait for Paul Merson, Sarah Hadland and Sam Quek too. “Keeeeeep dancing,” chirrup Tess and Claud. As the glittery dust settles, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight’s routines now get recapped on-screen. Which fab-ew-lous pair are you voting for? Which dance dis-ah-ster are you definitely not? Cue props, mugging for the camera and all-round pandemonium in the Clauditorium, set to Spandau Ballet’s Gold (one of my karaoke staples, FYI). When did this enjoyably daft Saturday night tradition start? Last five series or so, do we reckon? It’s hard to remember a time without it. Judges’ scores for Tasha and Aljaž: 9, 10 (first of the series), 10 (never too early from Shirley), 10 for a total of 39 points. Wowzers. Too much, too soon? Judges’ comments for Tasha and Aljaž: Motsi says “one word – fab-u-lous”. That’s not your line, Motsi. Shirley says “practically flawless”. Anton says “can’t fault it”. Craig concludes “left foot let you down but a-may-zing”. Nines ahoy? They topped last week’s leaderboard with their Barbie rumba. Thankfully Aljaž has now lost the mildly disturbing blond Ken wig. Tasha Ghouri is a graceful dancer - she’s racked up 99 points in her three dances so far, the most in the field - but can she showcase her fun side and capture the Charleston’s manic, kooky energy? It’s selfies-at-Coachella-themed, for some random Gen Z reason, with Tasha in cowgirl-ish fringed shorts and a crop top. Selfie stick-ography, which is a sentence I never thought I’d type. Fast-paced, upbeat and intense with loads of steps, tricks and content. Their first time doing lifts. Craig will be studying those lumpy dismounts, as well as the all-important swivel. A little stilted and disappointing for me. Song: Unhealthy by Anne-Marie feat Shania Twain. The country-pop single from last year is about a toxic relationship with a western-style video filmed in Nashville and, ahem, Kent. Judges’ scores for Pete and Jowita: 7, 7, 8, 7 for a total of 29 points. His highest score. Generous in my book but hard to complain when he’s on the trademarked Strictly journey. Judges’ comments for Pete and Jowita: Craig says “hip rolls do not belong but I actually liked it”. Motsi says “like the John Travolta vibe but not consistent and transitions let you down”. Shirley says “you belted across the floor and shifted your weight, technically better, frame dropped but the hip roll was a treat”. Anton concludes “open work was brilliant but in hold, the voices in your head start screaming, you’ve got potential, make the next leap and don’t run out of weeks because you could challenge”. Sixes? After last week’s barefoot jungle samba, at least he’s back wearing shoes now. Pete Wicks and his pro partner Jowita Przystal have been the subject of showmance speculation on the tabloids this week, so see if you can detect any signs of sizzling chemistry. Pete’s been slowly improving and his scores creeping up each week. Knowing and loving the song - he says for the first time this series - should help. Tattoo parlour them, aptly, and 50s styling with quiff. Speed and energy but he’s struggling to stay in time. Rigid face when he should be smiling, visibly counting aloud and lacking lightness of footwork. Swagger and story but not much quickstep, bless him. Song: Town Called Malice by The Jam. Paul Weller wrote the Motown-influenced 1982 chart-topper about his desire to escape his hometown of Woking. Judges’ scores for Sam and Nikita: 7, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 28 points. Mid-table. Sam says she’s celebrating her body and her curves like never before. More power to her. Nikita makes random noises and Claudia says “Vito is catching”. Judges’ comments for Sam and Nikita: Motsi says “bam, bam, hit those lines and threw yourself into it, lots of challenging contents, needed more bounce but damn girl”. Shirley says “good timing, awkward in transitions but full of personality”. Anton says “gave it the full biffter, you’re in a great place, very strong, just keep your weight forward”. Craig concludes “lacked bounce, messy misplaced footwork but you sold it fantastically”. Sam Quek’s Tomb Raider paso last week saw her score rise into the 30s for the first time. Can she continue that form? She needs to attack it, committing to the samba’s details and precision. She’s channelling a Latina character called “Samba Samantha”, apparently. Vibrant neon rainbow frock with flouncy skirt. Unleashing her hips, rhythm changes and sass galore but rather rushing through the moves. A tad heavy footed at times but hot, hot, hot. Song: Hips Don’t Lie by Shakira. Not the other one, Nikita. When Nikita Kuzmin made that hilarious faux-pas on last week’s results show, singing the wrong Shakira song, he’d already started choreography to Whenever, Wherever. Oopsy. A great TV moment, nonetheless. Judges’ scores for Montell and Jojo: 8, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 33 points. Third on the scoreboard so far. Jojo admits that his main aim was not to get a demo time from Anton. “That’s brave, he can hear you,” says Claudia. Judges’ comments for Montell and Jojo: Anton says “so beautiful, my favourite dance of the night, exquisite”. Craig says “graceful, elegant, gaw-jus (told you)”. Motsi says “loved the softness and simplicity”. Shirley concludes “infectious personality, divine, great teamwork, creeping up there, you’re dangerous for the rest”. Eights and even a nine? The Gladiator’s second consecutive ballroom after her Dreamgirls tango in Movie Week. She needs to show improvement in hold, as her posture wobbled last week. Johannes gets his own “Water” Gladiator outfit in the VT. Montell Douglas is waiting for her man in a moonlit motel. Smooth and elegant, gliding around the floor. Dizzying spins and heart-meltingly romantic mood. Threw away a few extensions but generally gaw-jus. Song: Nobody Gets Me by SZA. The r’n’b diva’s country-tinged single from last year with lyrics about rekindling with an ex but ending up arguing. In case you were wondering, SZA’s stange name stands for Solána (her real name) Zig-Zag Allah. It’s taken from the Supreme Alphabet and inspired by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan. Judges’ scores for Chris and Dianne: 6, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 30 points. Joint third as we enter the home stretch. Judges’ comments for Chris and Dianne: Shirley says “I’m speechless, how you do those lifts so flawlessly without eye timing I can’t imagine, didn’t miss a trick timing-wise, impressive”. Anton says “you even made the kangaroo steps work, salsa steps a bit plonky but still remarkable”. Craig from Ballarat does his best Aussie accent and says “stompy, lacked flow and fluidity but bonzer”. Motsi concludes “I like development of your Latin, great musicality, a joy”. Sevens and eights, do we say? Another energetic, upbeat dance for blind comedian Chris McCausland, following last week’s Wayne’s World jive. Craig commented on his great timing and musical ear, so Dianne Buswell cleverly choreographs to play to his strengths - as well as choosing an Aussie theme for a taste of home. It’s fast and full-on with “more bloody lifts than Canary Wharf”, according to Chris. Tricks and hip action. Speed, lots of steps and cracking lifts. Some kangaroo jumps, unless I’m mistaken. Lacks spice and hip action but otherwise stupendous. So good, it almost made me forgive those yellow slacks. Song: Down Under by Men at Work. The Australian band’s 1983 chart-topper is about an Australian man travelling the tourist trail in “a fried-out Kombi”, meaning a Volkswagen camper van. Do you speak-a my language? He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich. Judges’ scores for JB and Amy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Solidly top half. Judges’ comments for JB and Amy: Craig says “you got stuck, lacked connection but you did a difficult dance justice”. Motsi says “I saw technique, leg action and Cuban motion, passion, enjoyed it”. Shirley says “sultry, lovely forward work but needs more rotation, rather enjoyed it”. Anton concludes “you’re a dream student but I’d like to see more freedom, so let it go”. Sevens and the odd eight? He wowed last week with his West End-worthy Willy Wonka number and is turning into quite the ballroom boy but now it’s back to Latin for JB Gill. His pro partner Amy Dowden loves the rumba and this is her first one on Strictly but it’s notoriously challenging for celebrity males. JB’s been struggling with the tricky technique in training this week. It’s slow and exposing with nowhere to hide but he’s doing a very decent job indeed. Sensual and romantic, with a nice connection established between them. Lacks a little continuous flow and earthiness, she’s dancing around him at times, but sizzling, stylish and smouldering. Song: You Might Need Somebody by Kara Marni. A cover of the jazz-soul hit made famous by Randy Crawford in the 80s and Shola Ama in the 90s. Judges’ scores for Paul and Karen: 4 (boo!), 6, 6, 7 for a total of 23 points. His highest yet and out of the bottom two. Claudia suggests he’s a great dancer and Paul wryly replies “Steady on”. Judges’ comments for Paul and Karen: Anton says “I take my top hat off to you, what a job, no irony, did it straight, just great”. Craig says “fix the style, frame, heaviness and gapping but we have progression”. Motsi says “you melted my heart, eyes up and smile”. Shirley concludes “came down the stairs looking sophisticated, I was smiling inside, delightful, Mr Debonair”. Sixes, do we reckon? The wild west dance-off survivors attempt a proper ballroom routine for the first time. No props, fancy dress or comedy factor this time. Paul Merson is trying to keep a straight face for a sophisticated Fred Astaire number. Looking debonair in a tailsuit with top hat and cane. Very gentlemanly. With the axe hovering over him, he’ll need to show improved technique and timing if he’s going to escape another dance-off. Old-style Hollywood feel and cane-ography, then into hold. He’s jogging rather than skipping but great effort, even if he looks slightly terrified. Some showmanship if not all the footwork. Song: I Won’t Dance by Fred Astaire. This playful jazz standard from the 1930s has been recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis and Lady Gaga with Tony Bennett. Strictly alumnus Will Young crooned it for Pop Idol: The Big Band Album and Jessica Lange for the Grey Gardens soundtrack. Judges’ scores for Punam and Gorka: 4, 5, 5, 6 for a total of 20 points. Bottom as it stands. Judges’ comments for Punam and Gorka: Motsi says “pressure got to you after last week, quite a few mistakes, hot and cold”. Shirley says “lacked rotation but great kick section, you’ve got the support of the nation and we love you”. Anton says “I tied my own tie, see you next week”. Craig concludes “sloppy, messy, full of mistakes, not your night”. Four from Craig, fives from the rest? Dr Punam Krishan came alive last week and reduced Motsi to tears with her milestone Bollywood routine, which took her to the dizzy heights of joint second on the leaderboard. Can she keep that momentum going? Strange pink foil outfits and futuristic diner theme. An energetic jive with plenty of flicks and kicks but she needs more control and retraction. Could be on the balls of her feet more to keep it lighter. She hops up up on chair and table at the end. Technically shaky and lost timing but fun. Not quite what the doctor ordered. Song: 2 Be Loved (Am I Ready) by Lizzo. The pop diva and classically trained flautist’s 2022 single. Its retro new wave-meets-disco sound has been compared to both the Pointer Sisters and Hall &amp; Oates, which is totally fine by me. Judges’ scores for Wynne and Katya: 8, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 34 points. His highest yet and joint top with Jamie. “I’m an overweight opera singer and I’m having the best time,” says Wynne. “Maybe fat men can dance after all. I found my ribs this week after not seeing them since 1987.” Judges’ comments for Wynne and Katya: Anton says “committed to the concept and character, tremendous, one of your best”. Craig says “thumb sticking up but love, love, loved it, Wynne, Wynne, Wynne”. Motsi says “your best dance yet, story with quality underneath”. Shirley concludes “took risks, passionate, told a tale, I got goosebumps, you’re in it to win it, mate”. He’s had sevens and eights for the past two weeks and might just better that here. Wynne Evans casts off the Mrs Doubtfire costume to show his more serious side. It’s a Wall Street-style story with his pro partner Katya Jones playing a financier’s disgruntled secretary. He’s been working hard on his tango posture, so needs to keep his legs low and spine straight. Briefcase-ography, tie-adjusting and takes far too long to get going. Assertive and leading well, although the effort is visible on his face. Lacks snap and staccato. Not quite on the money, money, money for me but the audience love it. Song: Money, Money, Money by Abba. The Swedish pop deities’ 1976 hit was originally titled Gypsy Girl and was the only Abba single during their mid-70s imperial phase not to top the UK chart. Deborah Meaden and the much-missed Robin Windsor also tangoed to it during the 2013 series. Judges’ scores for Jamie and Michelle: 8, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 34 points. His best yet and top of the leaderboard after four dances. Judges’ comments for Jamie and Michelle: Shirley is momentarily lost for words but says “shifted from foot to foot, led your lady and brought joy, your best dance so far”. Anton says “by far your best, superb energy, feet and hips could’ve worked more but killing it from the waist up”. Craig says “needed more figure-of-eight in the hip action but you’re an incredible dancer”. Motsi concludes “great partnering but you shone in the spotlight, you left your heart on the dancefloor”. I’m smelling eights. Or is it Ambre Solaire? EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick closed the show last week, dressed as Su Pollard (or was it Elton John?) for his Rocketman quickstep. Now he needs to keep that high energy but control it and show some Cuban party technique. He’s playing a holiday rep, she’s a tourist. Flog those excursions, Jamie. Free cocktail for lady! Best bar on island! Fast and fluid with changes of rhythm. Shoulder shimmies and his first lifts but a lumpy dismount. Lacking spice but heaps of high-energy fun and a strong finish. Song: Danza Kuduro by Don Omar and Lucenzo. This 2010 banger mixes Latin with reggaeton and duly became a worldwide hit, topping the chart in a dozen countries. It stayed at number one in Italy for a whopping 10 weeks. Judges’ scores for Nick and Luba: 4, 6, 5, 6 for a total of 21 points. Dance-off danger? My liveblog assistant tonight, 12-year-old May, says: “Shame Nick isn’t dressed as Paddington - but he does dance like a bear!” Judges’ comments for Nick and Luba: Craig says “let yourself go and be more crazy, extend your lines, placed rather than danced, no swivel but fantastic character”. Motsi says “coming back took courage, slow pace but tidy and readable”. Shirley says “took risks, used props, lovely synchronisation but I missed a sense of freedom”. Anton concludes “enjoyed the number, you improved Craig’s choreography, exquisite timing”. Fives and sixes? After missing last week’s show, injury-prone DIY SOS host Nick Knowles’ knee is on the mend and doctors have given him clearance to dance. Because of his reduced training time, they’re picking up where they left off with the Paddington number they had planned for Movie Week. Nick’s pleased to be belatedly doing it, as his 10-year-old son Eddie is a fan of the Peruvian bear. He’s unleashing his showbizzy, jazz-handy side to play villainous thesp Phoenix Buchanan, with Luba Mushtuk as the late Queen’s mate. She’s adjusted the steps to be easier on his knees. It duly lacks a little bounce and speed but has a sweet musical theatre feel. Brolly-ography, lifts and tricks. Heavy-footed but happiness-making. Song: Rain on the Roof from Paddington 2. Originally from the musical Follies, it’s sung at the end of the film by Phoenix in prison - and the accompanying dance number was choroegraphed by no less than Craig Revel Horwood. Pit-pitty-pat indeed. Judges’ scores for Sarah and Vito: 6, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 27 points. A slight dip. Judges’ comments for Sarah and Vito: Shirley says “flawless spotting on the spins but your footwork didn’t glide, work on the seamlessness in ballroom”. Anton says “short steps, too trotty, lost its flow, lovely storyteling but stride out”. Craig says “lacked glide, gapping, too much attack but magnificent turns, you’re a clean, clean dancer”. Motsi concludes “you capture the music as you dance, allow yourself to breathe and let go”. Sevens a-coming? Her Harry Potter waltz last week was Motsi’s highlight of the night and saw her joint second on the scoreboard. Again. Now actor Sarah Hadland stays in ballroom hold for a graceful and lyrical foxtrot. She’s sporting a blue aqua floral frock, like a grown-up Elsa from Frozen. Emotional with lovely lines, delicate details and softness. The song is a favourite of her and her daughter, so there’s real feeling in this. A bit wobbly in places but lovely. Song: Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish. The recent single which featured in teen Netflix drama Heartstopper and was performed by Eilish at the Olympic Closing Ceremony. Not to be coinfused with the theme tune to 90s sitcom Birds of a Feather which was, of course, What’ll I Do. Sharon! Tracey! Dorien from next door! We’ve only just got rid of him. The picture-slamming spexy beast is this week’s surprise Clauditorium guest, reading out the voting Ts &amp; Cs. Judges’ scores for Shayne and Nancy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Generous. Judges’ comments for Shayne and Nancy: Motsi says “cool, calm and collected but use your arms more”. Shirley says “huge improvement since your week one samba, loved the sense of freedom, work on that co-ordination and posture”. Anton says “loved the partnering and connection, keep the improvement going”. Craig concludes “lacked resistance and tone (boo!), arms need attention but great groove, liked it a lot”. Sevens, do we think? Shayne Ward’s scores have been steadily rising. Can he continue to show improvement in his first Latin number since week one? Bowling alley theme. Ghastly neon custard-coloured outfits. Showcasing his fun side with solo sections and hip action. Timing and leg technique are the challenge here. I’m not sure he’s nailing the latter. A fun disco number and a decent semi-moonwalk to end. Song: Ain’t No Love (Ain’t No Use) by Sub Sub feat Melanie Williams. This 1993 dance banger sampled Good Morning Starshine from Hair, which a band member owned on vinyl because he won it at a fair in his teens. Sub Sub later reinvented themselves as indie band Doves, trivia fans. First sighting of our couples as they come out for a welcome wave. Outfits are positively understated compared to last week’s Movie Week overload. Lots of pink. Wonder if Wynne Evans feels naked without his Mrs Doubtfire costume? And if Pete Wicks feels restricted in, you know, actual clothes and shoes? Here come the hoofing inspectors, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas, cutting some rug to Lionel Ritchie’s Dancing On The Ceiling. Synchronised sit-down in three, two, one… Sit! Ooh, I felt like Barbara Woodhouse there. The hostly duo arrive, so time for our weekly couture comparison. Tess Daly is in a lilac shoulder-less jumpsuit affair. Claudia Winkleman is in a simple black frock with a pop of red lippy. Claud wins. Only the gingers have left so far, with Tom Dean and Toyah Willcox becoming the first two celebrities to depart the dancefloor. Who’s next for the auburn axe? Cue the usual scene-setting, tension-building montage. Grab a glass and nab some nibbles. We’re about to go over live to the Elstree Studios ballroom… Alan Carr’s Picture Slam reaching a bifocal crescendo on BBC1 now. That’s Numberwang! Tonight’s musical selections include Abba, Shakira, Lizzo and Billie Eilish, as well as a reggaeton favourite and a banger by The Jam. Well, it beats the George Of The Jungle theme song. A mere five minutes until the glitterball starts spinning… There was an official BBC announcement this week that on Saturday 2nd November, we can look forward to Strictly’s first ever Icons Week, with dances inspired by musical legends - and just as temptingly, a Beyoncé-themed pro dance led by Jojo Radebe. Now that’s what I call bootylicious. Ten minutes until the glittery clock strikes… Anyone see Gogglebox last night? Giles and Mary were amusingly outraged by Pete Wicks’ pelvic thrusting in a leopard print loincloth. Oh, Nutty. Meanwhile, over on Have I Got News For You, Paul Merton said of Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style salsa: “If that had happened in a public park, he would’ve been arrested.” Heeeeey, sexy lady. We can look forward to two salsas, two quicksteps and two Charlestons, among various other choreographic treats. No Couple’s Choices, slightly surprisingly. Not long until the spangly curtain comes up… Tick them off with a flourish when you spot them on-screen! Take a drink for each! End up face down in a kebab! Here’s this week’s 10-point checklist: Tess Daly exclaims “They’re on their feet!” to someone who can patently see that everyone is on their feet Eliminated pro Ginger Neil elbows his way to the front of the balcony crowd Jamie Borthwick risks their wrath by doing an impression of the judges Celebrity relative in the front row glances up at the monitor, then gives an embarrassed wave Anton says “That was the sort of routine I’d have loved to dance” Shirley Ballas produces her pair of haunted Victorian child’s shoes again Chris McCausland gives some post-critique lip to Craig Way-too-soon mention of Halloween or Blackpool Anton calls a demo time to teach better ballroom hold Judge says “It’s week four now, so we’re looking for footwork and technique” The show’s running time tonight is a nice, round two hours - fully 15 minutes shorter than last week. Snappy. It’s 15 minutes until the glittery klaxon sounds… Could it be knockout time for Paul Merson? He’s the lowest scorer left in the contest, is yet to score more than a six and appeared in last week’s dance-off. Bookies say he’s odds-on favourite for the exit. Tipped to join him in the dance-off are either Pete Wicks or Nick Knowles. Both Paul and Pete are dancing quicksteps this evening, which should make for an intriguing comparison. Not long until we get our first choreographic clues… Yes, he’s back from the sickbay! A BBC spokesperson announced on Friday night: “We are all delighted that Nick Knowles and Luba Mushtuk will be dancing in this Saturday’s show. Nick has been cleared to dance by the medical and physio teams following his injury last week. Due to time taken out of training this week, they will be performing their Movie Week Charleston to Rain On The Roof from Paddington 2.” Good news all round. Nobody wanted an injury dropout. We’ll also finally get to see Luba’s Paddington outfit. It could get sweaty, dancing in a duffel coat and floppy hat. Just 20 minutes until spray tan-and-Spanx time… That’s a wrap. Yes, the credits have rolled on Movie Week and there’s no fancy dress for our hoofing couples to hide behind. Good evening and welcome to the latest live weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I’m Michael, your virtual dance partner for tonight’s mercifully non-themed show. You are warmly invited to watch along with me as our 13 surviving pro-celebrity pairs take to the Elstree Studios dancefloor once more. After last week’s celluloid special and second elimination - when Toyah Willcox followed Tom Dean onto the glittery bus home - our unlucky 13 will become a dancefloor dozen this weekend. Tonight’s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two duos will perform for survival on Sunday night. Who’ll become the third celebrity to bite the ballroom dust? Dance-off survivor Paul Merson looks the most vulnerable. Pete Wicks, Dr Puman Krishan and Nick Knowles, bouncing back from his injury, could also find themselves in danger. It’s showtime at 6.20pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 5.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ballroom backchat. So hold your calls, cancel your social plans and I’ll see you on the sofa. As always, I’d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for the usual sequin-spangled discussion. I’ll Charleston swivel down there every now and again to gauge your reaction and report on your witty wisdom. In week four, who’ll be weak on the floor? Nearly time to staaaart dancing!"

          "bodyText": "At this year’s Labour party conference, health secretary Wes Streeting opened his DJ set at one late-night party with the feminist anthem Independent Women by Destiny’s Child. It was a tribute to Rachel Reeves, who was standing nearby. A few moments later, partygoers watched as the health secretary scurried over, a look of faux alarm on his face. “It’s the lyrics – I’m so sorry!” he gasped. The chancellor, a quizzical look on her face, joined him as he mouthed the offending words: “The shoes on my feet (I bought ’em). The clothes I’m wearing (I bought ’em) … ” They stifled horrified laughter. The cash-for-clothes row, in which Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and, to a lesser extent, Reeves have come under sustained fire for accepting gifts worth thousands of pounds from Labour peer Lord Waheed Alli, has been a low point for the newly elected government. It is certainly not how Starmer envisaged his first 100 days in office would end. Keen to avoid the same mistakes as Tony Blair, who later admitted he wished he had done more early on, this Labour government got off to a hyperactive start after 14 years out in the cold. But along with all the big decisions, new legislation, foreign trips and attempts to set the political narrative, they have found themselves buffeted by headwinds: not just over donations, but also stories of internal rows at No 10 and, perhaps most significantly, a backlash over the cut to the winter fuel payment. There are, of course, different views on how meaningful “100 days” assessments really are. Do these first weeks set the tone for government, or are they quickly forgotten? After all, any new administration takes time to get their feet under the table, especially when they have little institutional memory of power. But, for better or worse, this is a moment when the political ecosystem pauses and ponders. I spoke to more than two dozen people, including cabinet ministers, senior political aides, leading civil servants and Keir Starmer himself, to get a sense of how it has been on the inside. * * * When Keir Starmer walked up Downing Street just hours after Labour had won its enormous landslide victory, he grasped his wife Victoria by the hand and worked his way up the flag-waving, cheering crowd, shaking hands and hugging. The images were beamed across the world. But what nobody picked up was the fleeting moment when the new prime minister locked eyes with his two teenage children, who were tucked away in the throng. “I can safely tell you this secret now,” he tells me. “We hid the kids in the crowd in Downing Street. I really wanted them to be there, but we didn’t want them walking down the street because of the way we’ve tried to keep them out of the public eye. I caught their eye. I didn’t go to them, for obvious reasons. But it was fantastic to have them there. Nobody knew. But it was a really important moment for the family.” Top: Starmer ascends the famous stairs at No 10. Above: Larry, the Downing Street cat, takes centre stage After Starmer’s speech to the country, the couple headed through the famous black door of No 10 to be greeted by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. But Starmer stopped briefly to shake hands with one man: Morgan McSweeney, the political mastermind behind the party’s win. The Starmers were led into the cabinet room, where they were joined by their children, Victoria’s sister and elderly father, Bernard, for a cup of tea and a biscuit, and a brief chance to privately take in the enormity of what had just unfolded. For his team, bone-tired from an intense 43-day election campaign, yet running on adrenaline after a night of dramatic results, their arrival in Downing Street on the morning of 5 July came as something of a shock. “You get two or three hours sleep in a hotel, then stagger to 70 Whitehall,” one senior No 10 figure says, referring to the address of the Cabinet Office. “They give you a bacon sandwich, a coffee and a terrifying security briefing, and then you get ushered into a room to start forming a government.” “It’s mad, it doesn’t feel safe,” another adds. “It’s an incredibly brutal system. Other countries have transition periods.” World leaders including Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz made the same point in their first phone calls with the new prime minister. Labour had a plan for their early days of government, carefully worked on for months by Sue Gray, Starmer’s then chief of staff. But despite that, I hear one constant refrain: it has been far from easy. Starmer insists he expected that. “It’s proved the thesis that government is tougher, but also that government is better, because you get to take decisions.” But after a bumpy start, there is anxiety that this might be more than the usual stumbles of a government getting used to the vagaries of office, and instead the symptoms of a dysfunctional No 10 operation, and even a lack of political acumen at the top. Yet there are still enough veterans of Blair’s early days to reassure Starmer that his predecessor’s first months have been viewed through rose-tinted spectacles, glossing over a damaging rebellion over benefit cuts for single-parent families, and the Bernie Ecclestone Formula One lobbying scandal. Starmer came into office aware that public opinion was not on his side, acknowledging in his Tate Modern rally late on election night that showing politics could be a force for good was the “great test” of our era. Just days before, a YouGov poll found that even among those who planned to vote Labour, more than 40% did not have high hopes. Top: Starmer with Italian PM Giorgia Meloni at the Villa Doria Pamphili, Rome, on 16 September. Above: meeting Italian CEOs in Rome But while his first three months have brought successes at home and abroad, his government has been beset by rows not just over donations and internal power struggles at No 10, but over the tough economic choices ahead, as well as questions over his political judgment that have left many in his party feeling jittery. Those who work most closely with Starmer say that his strength is “keeping his eye on the horizon” and being unswayed by what he sees as obstacles along the way. “I knew from observing previous governments that you’re going to get side winds all the time,” Starmer says. “But my line of sight is on what I’ve got to have delivered after one five-year term, and a decade of national renewal.” Yet even those close to him accept he doesn’t always appreciate how aloof that approach might appear. “We all hope it’s teething troubles,” one senior Labour politician confides. “But we all worry in case it’s something worse.” Finally, after warnings from senior aides and cabinet ministers to “get a grip”, Starmer came to the conclusion that some of those side winds risked blowing the government fully off course. His response: Gray would have to go. * * * One of Starmer’s first tasks on entering office was to pick his cabinet. He had always planned to transfer his shadow team straight over into government roles, with a few tweaks. The reshuffle appeared to go smoothly. But behind the scenes it was more fraught. “We had to work out who had held their seats and where everybody was. Hilary Benn was still in Leeds. Steve Reed was late because he was at home in his shorts,” one aide says. They were given the Northern Ireland and environment briefs. “After Shabana [Mahmood] was offered justice secretary she panicked about whether she was also lord chancellor, which usually goes with the job, and tried to get back into the room to check.” She was reassured that was the case by civil servants. “Liz [Kendall] was so emotional she was in tears.” The arrivals didn’t go entirely to plan. They had been carefully choreographed so the most senior ministers would get there first. But Yvette Cooper and David Lammy, as home and foreign secretary respectively, had their movements controlled by their security teams, and in the meantime Wes Streeting sauntered up the street. Initially at least, the rest of it went as hoped. Just four days after taking office, Starmer flew to Washington DC for the Nato summit. “It’s a gift from Rishi,” he chuckled to officials. It was a useful early opportunity to meet world leaders while the electoral gold dust was still glimmering, and they all were keen for some to rub off. Starmer paid his first visit to the White House at the height of speculation over Joe Biden’s future. The two men discussed the “special relationship” and wider global affairs. But officials who had followed the UK election campaign closely were amused when they touched on their fathers, and Starmer volunteered that his was a toolmaker. Later, on his third visit to the US as prime minister, he would meet Donald Trump for a private two-hour dinner at Trump Tower in New York, riding up to his penthouse in the garish gold elevator amid heavy security after two assassination attempts. Labour was on a charm offensive after senior party figures criticised the former president in the past, with Lammy, who attended the dinner, previously describing Trump as a “tyrant in a toupee”. “He came up from Florida for it, so he took it really seriously,” Starmer says. “He’s different in private than he is in public. The way he engages in conversations, the way he addresses issues. He’s more thoughtful.” Trump was curious about how Labour had won back the “red wall” to secure such a huge election victory, sources say, perhaps with an eye on how the rust belt states in the US could play a similar role in his own re-election campaign. * * * Back home, Labour’s first king’s speech initially went off without a hitch, bringing in bills to nationalise the railways and establish Great British Energy, improve workers’ rights and change planning rules to build more houses. In a frenzy of activity, ministers scrapped the Tories’ Rwanda scheme and set up a border security command to tackle small-boat crossings. They invited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Downing Street, and took first steps to reset relations with the EU. They reached pay deals with junior doctors and train drivers, and funded above-inflation public sector wage rises, helping to reverse years of decline. But just two weeks into office, Starmer faced his first major test, a Commons rebellion calling for the two-child benefit cap to be scrapped. Inside No 10, it was seen as an early and not entirely unhelpful opportunity to flex their muscles with Labour backbenchers, particularly on the left. Outside, though, it filled many MPs, including some in the cabinet, with dismay. “If we’re not tackling child poverty, what are we?” one said at the time. All seven rebels, including veteran leftwinger John McDonnell, were stripped of the whip for six months. The government announced a child poverty taskforce, but it did little to stem despair across the party, and the wider public, over such a symbolic issue. Top: rehearsing his conference speech at Labour party HQ. Above: with his wife Victoria in Liverpool Starmer had always been clear there would be tough choices ahead given the state of the economy, and wanted to pin the blame on the Tories as fast as possible. Over in the Treasury the chief secretary, Darren Jones, joked that he had gone through his desk drawers in case his predecessor had left him a “no money left” note. Within days of becoming chancellor, Reeves announced the Treasury would be carrying out an audit of the fiscal inheritance – one of the worst since the second world war. It found a £22bn black hole in government spending plans for essential public services in 2024-25. Labour immediately leapt on the deficit as evidence of irresponsible management of the economy, paving the way for tax increases and painful spending cuts in the budget. But to help fill the black hole, they made what many regard as their biggest mistake: cutting the winter fuel payment. Reeves has been bullish – in private and in public – about the decision, arguing that she had no choice and that the axe would otherwise have fallen on support for disabled people or families with children. “There’s no way I’m doing that,” she is said to have told angry MPs. She has doubled down on her “iron chancellor” image, which aides believe has helped restore the party’s reputation for fiscal competence. In one political cabinet meeting, Ed Miliband, highlighting radical decisions made in straitened times, paid tribute to Labour for setting up the NHS in 1948 when rationing was still in place. Later, a minister was overheard teasing him for giving Reeves ideas. “Rationing?” she quipped. “I’ll make a note of that.” Many cabinet ministers are uncomfortable about the choice – and worry it will be weaponised by the Tories this winter – but for now are staying quiet. “[Reeves’ team] listened to the Treasury civil servants, rather than thinking about the political impact,” complains one senior party figure. “They’ve handled it appallingly,” adds a cabinet minister. Starmer admits it was one of the toughest choices he has had to make in government. “Of course it is. Of course I understand and respect people’s concerns,” he says. “But I deeply and strongly believe that we’ve got to stabilise the economy.” But one No 10 Labour adviser speaks to a wider anxiety. “People think it gives them an insight into how Labour will govern. They worry that what we’re going to do is hit people like them. They’re waiting for the moment of betrayal after so many years of being let down.” * * * Internal frustrations within Starmer’s top team, which had been kept at bay by the election, began to bubble over, with Gray increasingly becoming the lightning rod. Some political colleagues accused her of “control freakery” and creating a “bottleneck” in No 10 that had delayed policy decisions and appointments. “Before the election she said that cutting the number of spads was about ensuring the civil service ran things,” one campaign insider claims. Special advisers, even usually loyal ones, were especially forthcoming in their criticism, with conversations quickly turning to how she handled their contracts and salaries. Their anger exploded into the semi-open when it was leaked that Gray was paid more than the prime minister. “There’s a bunch of political advisers who could get access to Keir whenever they wanted in opposition,” one source said at the time. “But now they can’t – that’s not how government works – and they don’t like it. Sue is protecting his time. She’s just doing her job.” Preparations for government had been put in the hands of Gray and a small team of party officials, working at a secretive office around the corner from Labour’s HQ in Southwark. Visitors were discouraged. “We were told Sue had a plan, and to keep our noses out of it,” says one campaign adviser. “But she clearly didn’t.” One view is that some of Downing Street’s early problems could have been avoided if they had spun a clearer narrative around all the activity. “There was no big set of announcements to capture that spirit of change,” says an insider. Gray was getting the blame for many of the missteps. It had become unsustainable. At the end of last week, Starmer summoned her to a meeting, at which he told her that she would have to go. McSweeney was appointed chief-of-staff in her place, supported by two deputies and a new director of strategic communications; there are hopes of calmer waters. “I want to make Downing Street boring again,” McSweeney is said to have told officials. If the reset at the top fails to deliver, there is nowhere left to hide. But Starmer believes they’re now on track. “You will always get people giving a view, of course. I do it myself in Arsenal games, as do 59,999 other fans. It’s the same in politics. But only the manager knows the gameplan for this match.” * * * At the end of July, Starmer’s plan to make a speech warning that “things will get worse” before they get better was blown off course by a horrific stabbing at a dance class in Southport, which left three young girls dead, sparking a series of far-right riots that spread nationwide. His response was unequivocal. As rioters threw bricks at police officers, set vehicles on fire and attacked a mosque, the prime minister warned they would “feel the full force of the law” and be hauled in front of the courts within one week. He was fearful the situation could spin even more out of control. “When people tried to set fire to a hotel in Rotherham, that was the point where I was really worried,” he says. In the first emergency Cobra meeting on the riots, he was presented with official data that showed there were just five spaces available in jails in the north-west of England. “Keir’s eyes almost popped out,” one attendee says. Yet the crisis played to Starmer’s strengths, including his experience running the Crown Prosecution Service during the London riots in 2011, and after a week the disorder subsided, leaving the country scarred but his own reputation enhanced. By then, however, the Commons was in recess and everybody was on holiday, so his plan for a speech was delayed. When the moment finally came, most people were enjoying the late-August sun and the news that Oasis were reuniting. It seemed an odd time to bring them back down to earth with a bump. “I have to be honest with you: things are worse than we ever imagined,” Starmer said, setting off a ripple of anxiety among Labour MPs, many desperate for the government to offer some hope after their landslide victory. Downing Street brushed aside the jitters. “They need to get over it,” said one source at the time. “The public is sick of boosterism. Boris Johnson overpromising and underdelivering is a big factor in why people have lost faith in politics.” But within weeks, consumer confidence had fallen sharply amid growing fears over how much pain the budget would inflict. Many ministers felt the bleak outlook had been a mistake and could damage the push for growth. “The miserablism was totally self-defeating,” one Labour figure says. Top: watching Arsenal while at conference. Above: with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backstage No 10 strategists have since admitted they overdid the negativity, sending out Pat McFadden – described by one colleague as a man who “could make an undertaker look cheerful” – to roll the pitch. “We may need to adjust the treble and the bass a bit, but the tune is the right one,” a source insists. * * * In late August, it emerged that Lord Alli, a long-term Labour donor who ran fundraising during the campaign, had been given a Downing Street pass, signed off by Gray. Nobody seemed clear why. “Waheed is a millionaire and he already has a peerage,” said one cabinet minister. “What more can he possibly want?” The damaging headlines continued. Alli was also Starmer’s biggest personal donor, giving him tens of thousands of pounds for designer glasses, clothes – including for his wife – and the use of a penthouse apartment during the campaign, which he later justified by saying his son needed somewhere quiet to study for his GCSEs. The hashtag #FreeGearKeir began trending on social media. Alli, who has an estimated £200m fortune, also loaned Rayner his luxury Manhattan apartment over New Year and paid for education secretary Bridget Phillipson’s 40th birthday party, as well as clothes for the deputy prime minister and Reeves. Cabinet ministers watched in incredulity as the stories kept coming. McFadden was overheard accusing the media of false equivalence. “There’s an attempt to say we’re all the same. I don’t believe that,” he said. Starmer agrees. “Look at what went before – Covid contracts, not actually complying with the rules, lying to parliament. It is a million miles away from all of that.” But the defiance risked blinding Labour to the obvious point: that the public has little patience for Westminster scandals. Telling them no rules have been broken or the Tories did worse does little to change that. The government eventually moved to shut down the row, saying that top ministers would no longer accept free clothes, and changing the rules on declaring interests and hospitality, while Starmer repaid some of the gifts – including Taylor Swift tickets – he had received since becoming prime minister, although not his free Arsenal tickets. Inside Labour, though, there is exasperation at how No 10 has handled the row. Some feel Starmer’s argument that he was saving the public purse in security costs by watching the football in a corporate box was flimsy. One aide tries to explain: “Keir regards it as tittle-tattle, a distraction, so his instinct is to ignore it.” Starmer himself tells me: “The moment I allow myself to get too bogged down in the side winds is the point that other governments have gone wrong in my view, because they’ve lost sight of what the real point of government is.” However, he later admits that he does understand the public aversion to politicians receiving gifts. “Yes, I can see that. I can see why you and others ask as many questions as you can.” The political and media environment that Starmer has walked into is entirely different from what has gone before. “There’s a naivety about what a knife-fight politics is today,” a senior official says. “Nothing is off limits. It’s a very brutal learning curve.” * * * Starmer’s friends say he has found the last few weeks, when his own family has been dragged into the donations row, particularly difficult. He is acutely aware that his teenage children, a son and a daughter, are at an impressionable age. “These things are never easy, but I suppose they’re part of the territory,” he tells me. “I’ve had versions of this before. I had it with Durham and beergate. I’m not going to pretend it’s pleasant, but it wasn’t a first-time experience, and I doubt it will be a last one, either.” Before he took office, Starmer promised his family he would try to keep Friday evenings with them sacred. “It has been a bit of a struggle, to be honest, because there’s been so much going on, but we’re still trying to carve out time,” he says. The family has installed Sky TV in the flat, so they can watch the football together. He wakes at 6am and spends the next two hours reading, before meetings with his top team. He usually heads upstairs to see the family around 8pm, and will do a bit more reading after the News at Ten, before heading to bed. He admits it feels “a bit odd” living in the Downing Street flat (where aides say the wallpaper installed by Boris Johnson is more muddy yellow than gold), but at least “it’s the shortest commute I’ve ever had”. It also means, for the first time in years, he sees his children when they get home from school. “Even if I’m in a meeting, and all I can do is say hello, give them a kiss and send them upstairs.” When the riots kicked off, Starmer cancelled his family holiday to Italy. Friends say he was exhausted after the long buildup to the election, but felt he should stay, especially when police were being asked to cancel leave. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that cancelling your holiday is a good thing,” he tells me. “I don’t believe in this sort of politics that says, you know, anybody that has a day off is a poor decision maker.” Yet for all the difficulties navigating family life in No 10, officials and aides alike say that Starmer is more temperamentally suited to the role of prime minister than leader of the opposition. “There were times when he was utterly miserable,” one friend says. “He would sit with his head in his hands in frustration at not being able to do anything.” Starmer increasingly spends his days in Downing Street working in the study upstairs, rather than the office used by most of his predecessors, having replaced the portrait of Margaret Thatcher that used to hang there with a landscape painting after feeling unsettled by her constant gaze. He has lunch at his desk, and is back on Pret tuna baguettes, having sworn off them in the campaign after eating them every day for five weeks, and drinks strong cups of tea throughout the day. Taking a break after an interview in the cabinet room at No 10 The civil service has had to get used to “Keir time”, with Starmer openly disapproving of anybody who turns up even a minute late to meetings. But officials say he is the first prime minister since David Cameron to trust his cabinet to get on with the job. Some ministers remain worried about living up to the weight of public expectation. They want him to better articulate what that change might look like, rather than just getting on with the job. In his conference speech, Starmer turned the dial, telling his audience he understood their impatience for change. He tells me there was a need for “a bit of sunny uplands”, and recognises that people are scared of being disappointed. “I have a heavy responsibility. My job is to deliver and I’m going to get judged on delivery. In the end, I want people to be better off under a Labour government. I want to be able to look people in the eye and say we’ve changed the way our economy works, so you are better off.” The budget later this month is unlikely to make him any more popular, with his personal ratings plunging to -30 after the conference. No 10 is undeterred. “You can’t say you’re going to do unpopular things and then say, ‘Oh my God, they’ve made me unpopular,’” a source says. Most Labour insiders believe the government can bounce back now that the new No 10 operation is in place. “It’s not like Liz Truss fucking the economy,” a source says. “None of this is terminal.” By the time of the next election, they believe, the country will be back on its feet, and voters who put their faith in Labour last time round reassured. Another insider is more succinct: “It’s all about delivery now. And if we don’t deliver, we’re fucked.”"

          "headline": "British soldiers jailed for selling cocaine worth nearly £100,000 to comrades",
          "bodyText": "A group of British soldiers have been jailed after a court heard they sold almost £100,000 worth of cocaine to fellow military personnel and bought designer products with the proceeds. A kilo of the drug was sourced in west London and sold by the four members of 5th Battalion, the Rifles, at Bulford camp in Wiltshire over a near three-year period, the court heard on Thursday. One of the soldiers bought a Rolex watch and Christian Louboutin shoes and boasted of having to do some “Gordon Ramsay magic” by cutting the cocaine with a caffeine product before selling it on, the court heard. Another ran a payday loan scheme to colleagues, which the court heard may have contributed to the poor state of mind of a 20-year-old soldier who took his own life. Bulford military court heard that Rifleman Claudius Scott orchestrated the operation with Rfn Ryan Saedi his second in command. L/Cpl Bradley Hesketh and Rfn Ashleigh Walker were “trusted dealers”. Scott and Saedi, both 31, made more than £40,000 each. They, Hesketh, 27, and Walker, 29, all admitted conspiracy to supply drugs. Will Martin, prosecuting, told the court the “network” of drug dealing was in place between January 2018 and December 2020. He said: “Scott, Saedi, Walker and Hesketh all played a role in supplying to other service personnel. The conspiracy was straightforward. Cocaine would be sourced from west London and sold on to service personnel. It was well known they were drug dealers.” The court heard they cut the cocaine with a Pro Plus caffeine product and on one occasion when the drug arrived, Hesketh texted an accomplice: “We’re going to need to do some magic work to it – some Gordon Ramsay work” – a reference to the cutting process. In another exchange read out in court, Scott messaged Hesketh expressing concern about his lack of discretion after he was spotted wearing a Rolex and new Christian Louboutin shoes in the nearby town of Amesbury. Hesketh told Scott to “chill” but added: “My bad.” The court heard there was a “culture of money lending at high interest rates” within the battalion. Saedi had implemented a “double bubble” loan scheme, which required cash-strapped colleagues who borrowed from him to repay double the amount on their next pay day. He would “persistently chase down” those who owed him money, encourage them to take out other loans and threaten them, the court was told. In a text to a relative, he said his borrowers were giving him sob stories – “their cat died, they got to pay for the funeral” – but he added: “I don’t give two fucks.” One of his customers was Rfn Nathan Worner, who killed himself in May 2020. After Worner missed a payment, Saedi found out his home address and told him: “Bruv send me my money or I’m coming to your house.” In a statement read to the court, Worner’s mother, Alison Blackwell, said she was “haunted” by the thought of his influence on her son’s death. “I believe their greed and intimidation would have at least contributed to his state of mind,” she said. In relation to his loan scheme, Saedi admitted conduct prejudicial to good order. Scott was jailed for four years and one month as the “initiator and leader” of the group. Saedi was jailed for three years and four months, Hesketh for three years and one month, and Walker for two years and nine months. Addressing them, the assistant judge advocate John Atwill said: “You all chose to join a criminal conspiracy to supply cocaine to members of your unit for your own financial gain.” He also said Saedi’s “insidious” payday loan scheme had been run on a “very significant scale”."

          "bodyText": "If there was a low point in the history of Kamp Studios, it had to have been the day in 2010 when Kim Collins and Amy Morgenstern found themselves lugging every single quarter, dime, nickel and penny they had scrounged up from their apartment to pour into a coin-counting machine at a Brooklyn branch of TD Bank. The women, then partners in both work and life, were barely making rent while trying to keep their plastering business afloat. “We were practically the only customers in the bank and that machine was very, very loud,” Collins says. “It was mortifying.” They used the $117 they collected that day to buy groceries. Plasterwork is famously labor-intensive, messy and physically demanding – but these weren’t the only factors that made getting a foothold in the homebuilding space challenging for Collins and Morgenstern. According to a 2024 survey by the construction workforce management platform Lumber, women make up 10% of the construction industry, and only 4% of on-site workers are women. “With the exception of the interior designer or architect, who are sometimes women, we are usually the only women working on a job site,” says Collins. Fourteen years after the TD Bank incident, Kamp Studios is a favorite of interior designers and architects across the country. The company, whose craftsmanship and artistry have been called “the gold standard” by Architectural Digest, has expanded to three cities, including Los Angeles and Miami, and employs nearly 40 plaster specialists. Collins, 53, co-founded the business in 2004 with a different original partner. In 2010, her partner left the company and Collins hired Morgenstern, a self-taught painter and former West Point student who was planning to be a doctor. In a whirlwind turn of events, the two women fell in love. Morgenstern, 38, dropped out of her pre-med program and joined Collins full-time. Plaster is an age-old material that dates back to the early Egyptians. Plaster walls were standard in pre-war construction in the United States but declined after the 1940s with the advent of drywall, which requires significantly less time and labor to install. Fans say that the material that Collins and Morgenstern work with remains unmatched for its durability, tactile beauty and eco-friendliness. The breakthrough for Kamp arrived in 2017. Athena Calderone, an up-and-coming lifestyle influencer, had recently purchased a house in Brooklyn with her husband. Calderone proposed a barter: if Kamp did all the plasterwork for free, Calderone would promote the company on her website, EyeSwoon. On their first day at work, Calderone posted an Instagram Story (then a brand-new feature) of the two women creating an unusual fluted design (now one of their signature finishes) on a wall. “It was like a switch went on,” says Collins. “We had been working really hard doing our thing all those years, but until the explosion on Instagram, we had been in a bubble,” says Collins. “My phone started ringing and our business went haywire.” Collins and Morgenstern ended their romance in 2019, but remain partners in plaster. What’s it like to be women in the male-dominated industry of construction? Collins: I’ve never felt like a girl on a job site. I’ve always carried myself with a lot of confidence and I have a big personality. I think also because I’m gay I can have this dynamic with guys where I can be almost like a bro. Morgenstern: I went to West Point for college, where women are outnumbered 15 to one. I’ve also been a hardcore athlete all my life and I have very thick skin. So in a certain way, I was prepared for the construction industry. Have you ever been met with outright sexism or discrimination on the job? Morgenstern: The worst experience I’ve ever had was about five years ago, when I had just established Kamp in LA. I showed up at a site to do my first walk-through and the contractor literally said to my face: “You’re a girl? I don’t work like this. You’re going to be a prima donna.” But after about two weeks, I had that guy eating out of the palm of my hand. How did you make the transition from doing every job yourselves to hiring workers? Collins: After being the one doing the hands-on work for so long, I was scared to give up that control. But in 2018 when both of my parents got sick, I often had to go home [to Florida] to help out, leaving Amy alone. Amy eventually said: “I can’t do this. We have to hire help.” Once we realized we could train people and trust them, that of course allowed us to grow. How much of the actual plastering are you both doing now? Collins: I’m not on a wall anymore. I’m 53 and I stopped doing the work about seven years ago because it took a toll on me – it messed up my shoulder and I have three herniated discs. Morgenstern: I’m still addicted. If I go for a week without troweling, I’m an unhappy person. But I have to be careful not to overexert myself because I hope to have a baby in the next year. How did your personal breakup affect your working relationship? Collins: The year that Amy moved to LA was really rough. I was working with a client in New York who was so bullying and sexist I called Amy crying, begging her to come home. But separating gave both of us a healthier sense of independence. As for the business itself, expanding to LA has been incredible. We have nearly doubled our revenue. Morgenstern: We talk every day, multiple times a day. I would do anything for Kim and she would do anything for me. We are still like family."

          "headline": "How to make the perfect chana chaat – recipe",
          "bodyText": "Chaat, according to author and food writer Priya Krishna, is less a family of savoury Indian snacks and more “a way of life … a category of food that hits practically every element that makes something craveable – sweet, sour, tangy, spicy, and crunchy”. The name, Nashville chef Maneet Chauhan told the New York Times, comes from the verb chaatna, meaning “to lick”, because good chaat, which can be eaten at any time of day, should be, well, finger-licking good. Chef and author Roopa Gulati explains in India, her contribution to Bloomsbury’s World Vegetarian series: “There’s no single word in the English language that describes the spectrum of flavours delivered by chaat. However, in India, it’s the emotive-sounding chatpata that evokes myriad explosive tastes and textures. If you fee like eating something chatpata, the assumption is that it’s chaat, or at least a spicy, crunchy snack.” A chaat, whether enjoyed at a street stall, in a restaurant or with a pot of tea at home, is usually based around a starchy main ingredient – chopped samosas, for example, or fried potatoes – topped with a colourful canopy of fruity chutneys, cool dairy, crunchy snacks and a hot and tangy blend of spices. It’s a combination that’s precision-engineered to keep you coming back for another spoonful, so if you’re looking to eat more pulses, this chickpea version is guaranteed to help. The chickpeas As ever, you could use dried pulses here. I give them a go for the recipe in Madhur Jaffrey’s Indian Cookery (first published in 1982, the book has to explain to readers what chickpeas are), but I find they’re not strictly necessary. Indeed, if anything, the creamy texture of tinned beans is, in my opinion, slightly preferable. The Times of India asks its readers: “Who says you cannot have chaat while on a diet?” apropos its recipe using kala chana, or black chickpeas, which it says contain more fibre and protein than the white variety. Unfortunately, my testers and I find that they taste like diet food, too. Nice as kala chana are in a well-flavoured sauce, in a chaat their tough skins and slightly earthy flavour make them a clear second choice among my testers. Sumayya Usmani, the author of two books on Pakistani cuisine, suggests using soaked chana dal, or split chickpeas, instead, in her recipe on the BBC Good Food website. Ignoring the warning on the packet that cautions against eating them raw, I discover that I’m not particularly keen on their flavour and slightly chalky texture, but then I dislike all such sprouty pulses. If you’re a fan, by all means give the idea a go; I, however, am going to stick to the cooked variety. Should you want to bulk out the dish further, Gulati’s boiled potatoes add another buttery, starchy element that soaks up flavour like a champ, and are therefore highly recommended. The vegetables The recipes are also split between those, such as Jaffrey and Chetna Makan, who cook the tomato and onion base, and those, including the Times of India and Gulati, who simply chop it and add it raw (Usmani’s chaat, meanwhile, doesn’t contain either). I’m keen to include several fresh elements in the dish to add crunch – Usmani and the Times of India’s cucumber, and Gulati and Usmani’s pomegranate seeds. But it’s difficult not to fall for the kind of richly savoury marriage of flavours that comes only from cooking in oil. You can, of course, leave the dish to cool before eating it, if you prefer – and, like Jaffrey, keep a little raw onion, soaked in lemon juice to tame its bite, to stir in at the end for the best of both worlds. Though most recipes are unspecific on the point, sweeter red onions (though not the large sort generally found here) are much more common in India than the brown variety – Gulati suggests using an ordinary red onion, but shallots are my preference, not least because they tend to be slightly less sweet. Everyone uses green chillies, and Jaffrey and the Times of India add root ginger, too, which adds a zestier warmth that I very much enjoy with the tomatoes, in particular. The spices Ground ginger is also popular in the chaat masala, the spice mix that’s generally used to season chaat. It’s easy to find ready-made in large supermarkets and south Asian grocers, but, of course, will taste better made fresh. Gulati describes it as a “cornucopia of spices crammed with big flavours … the sulphurous aromas of quarried black salt and asafoetida contrast with the sour fruitiness of mango powder and the lingering warmth of black peppers, chillies and cumin. Carom seeds bring pungency and boast a flavour that straddles lovage and thyme.” She also adds mint leaves, which have their own slightly sweet, peppery perfume. Makan’s ingredients list is shorter, and includes fennel seeds instead of mint, as well as the sulphurous (would that there were a more appealing descriptor), sour and hot elements above. I suspect there are as many ways to mix a chaat masala as there are cooks, so I’ve gone for a pared-back example – feel free to experiment, bearing in mind that it should be both tangy and funky, as the New York Times delicately puts it. Gulati also adds extra cumin seeds to her dish, while Jaffrey, in the absence of chaat masala (perhaps such things were impossible to obtain in 1982), uses cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne and garam masala, so bear those in mind if you live somewhere where spices are hard to come by, though I would at least try to get hold of some amchoor, or mango powder, if you can. Its sourness is hard to replicate even with lemon juice. Extra chilli powder can be added to taste. The sauces Usmani mixes tamarind chutney into her salad, while Gulati is the only person to suggest dressing the chaat in its full regalia, with a sweet-and-sour homemade date and tamarind sauce and a cool mint and yoghurt raita. Though the chickpeas can stand alone, chaat’s vibe seems to me to be all about gilding the lily, so I’m going to suggest adding both. Note: date and tamarind sauce is easy to buy if making it from scratch feels a step too far (it’s surprisingly versatile, too: I find it works well on a bacon sandwich or with hard cheese). Dressing and garnish Tangy as the chaat masala and tamarind sauce are, a spritz of lemon or, my preference, lime juice brings the dish alive, especially with a generous scattering of fresh herbs. Coriander is the most popular choice, and my favourite, but Makan and Usmani use a little dill, too, and Usmani mint, a flavour that’s covered by my raita. The Times of India, mindful, perhaps, that even dieters need a little joy in their lives, suggests dusting the finished chaat with sev, which are deep-fried noodles made from chickpea flour. These prove to be the final piece of the puzzle – anything crunchy is inevitably extremely moreish. If you can’t get hold of that, you may feel inspired by the information that Chauhan has substituted cornflakes and tortilla chips, so as long as it’s crisp and savoury, it seems anything goes. After all, chaat is a vibe, not a prescription. Perfect chana chaat Prep 25 min Cook 35 min Serves 4 2 medium long shallots 1-2 green finger chillies (or other medium-hot pepper), finely chopped 1 tbsp finely grated root ginger Juice of 1 lime, or lemon 2 tbsp neutral oil 2 medium tomatoes, deseeded and diced 800g (2 x 400g tins) chickpeas, drained Chilli powder, to taste 1 small bunch fresh coriander, chopped ½ cucumber, deseeded and diced 1 handful pomegranate seeds 1 handful sev, or other crunchy snack, to finish (optional) For the chaat masala (or use 2 tsp of ready-made stuff) 1½ tbsp cumin seeds ½ tbsp black peppercorns ½ tbsp dried mint 2 tsp kala namak (AKA Himalayan black salt – NB it’s not black) 1½ tbsp amchoor (mango powder) ¼ tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp chilli powder For the date and tamarind sauce: (or use a ready-made version) 50g deseeded tamarind (from a larger block), “wet” tamarind for preference 75g pitted dates, roughly chopped 80g jaggery, or soft brown sugar ½ tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp garam masala Salt For the yoghurt sauce ¼ tsp cumin seeds 1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 100g whole yoghurt A pinch of salt ¼ tsp caster sugar 1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed If you are making the date and tamarind sauce, prepare the tamarind according to the packet instructions, then remove all the seeds to make up 50g pulp. Put this in a small pan with the dates and sugar, add water just to cover, then bring to a simmer and leave to bubble away until the dates are soft and pulpy. Meanwhile, toast the cumin seeds and black peppercorns for the masala, if making (you may as well toast the cumin seeds for the yoghurt sauce at the same time, too), in a hot dry pan. Once fragrant, set aside the cumin for the yoghurt, add the dried mint to the rest and use a pestle and mortar or spice grinder to reduce the mix to a fine powder. Stir in the remaining spices and set aside. Once the dates are soft, stir in the ginger, garam masala and a good pinch of salt, then push the mix through a sieve. If need be, whisk in just enough water to bring it to a pouring consistency; conversely, if it’s too thin, put it back in the pan and reduce further. For the yoghurt sauce, grind the remaining toasted cumin seeds to a powder and finely chop the mint. Put these in a bowl with all the other sauce ingredients, then whisk to combine. Finely chop a tablespoon of the shallot, and finely slice the rest. Put the chopped shallot in a small bowl with the green chilli, ginger, lime juice and a good pinch of salt, and set aside. Put the oil in a wide pan on a medium heat, then fry the sliced shallot until softened and beginning to colour. Stir in the tomato, fry for a minute or so, then add the chickpeas, chaat masala and a pinch each of salt and chilli powder to taste. Stir to coat (and to warm through), then tip into a serving dish and scatter over the remaining shallot and lime mixture. Check the seasoning and adjust as necessary. Just before serving, stir in the chopped herbs, cucumber and pomegranate seeds, then top with the sauces and a handful of sev, if using. What’s the essence of chaat as far as you’re concerned, and what are your favourites? Can you make it with almost anything, or are there limits? And how, specifically, do you prefer your own chana chaat?"

          "headline": "Republicans threaten to punish colleges that allow pro-Palestinian protests",
          "bodyText": "Top Republicans are threatening to pull billions of dollars of federal funding from some of the most prestigious universities in the US, stripping them of official accreditation to punish them for allowing pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. The Guardian has reviewed a video recording of a meeting in Washington last week between House majority leader Steve Scalise and the powerful pro-Israel lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). In it, Scalise outlined how he planned to unleash a massive attack against universities that fail to squash criticism of Israel. The offensive, which would be coordinated with the White House should Donald Trump win the presidential race in November, could even threaten the existence of universities, Scalise warned. He talked about revoking accreditation, the system by which higher education institutions are approved and to which the bulk of federal funds are tied. “Your accreditation is on the line,” Scalise said. “You’re not playing games any more, or else you’re not a school any more.” The Aipac meeting was held on 1 October, and was attended by Scalise and his fellow Republican congressman, Pat Fallon from Texas. The event was ostensibly billed as a discussion on the spread of antisemitism in the US since the start of the Gaza conflict on 7 October last year, when Hamas killed 1,200 people inside Israel and took 250 hostage. The attack sparked the Israeli offensive, which has destroyed much of the Palestinian territory and killed almost 42,000 people, according to local health authorities. The fall-out continues to roil campuses and cities throughout the US. Latest FBI figures show that the monthly rate of hate crimes against Jewish people in the US spiked in the aftermath of 7 October from 103 offenses in September 2023 to 389 in November. Anti-Muslim incidents have also surged. Despite the Aipac-Scalise meeting’s framing on antisemitism, most of the talk was about how to crush criticism of Israel’s military operation in Gaza. There was no attempt during the hour-long conversation to distinguish hatred of Jews from pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli government sentiments. Aipac is the most influential pro-Israel lobby group in the US. It has a $100m war chest to spend on the election this year, and is using that muscle to support political candidates that back the actions of the Israeli government and oppose those who are critical. This summer Aipac invested $23m in unseating in primary contests two core members of the progressive Democratic group the “squad”, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. The pair had called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have highlighted the death toll of civilians there. Fallon praised Aipac for intervening in the races. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for firing Jamaal Bowman, and even more so, Miss Cori Bush. Great work,” he said. “That’s accountability, by the way,” Scalise added. He further commended Aipac for having “tentacles throughout the Republican and Democrat circles in 435 districts. You can see how people are voting – just put the pressure on those who are voting the wrong way.” Scalise reserved his most potent threats for universities that in his view have failed to quash anti-Israel protests. He told Aipac that a second Trump administration would wield federal purse strings to punish the schools. “We’re looking at federal money, the federal grants that go through the science committee, student loans. You have a lot of jurisdiction as president, with all of these different agencies that are involving billions of dollars, some cases a billion alone going to one school,” Scalise said. The congressman from Louisiana is the second highest-ranking Republican in the House. He has travelled to Israel several times on trips paid for by the American Israel Education Fund, a group created by Aipac. Scalise singled out Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, which have been rattled by the controversy over student protests around the Gaza war. Penn’s president Elizabeth Magill resigned last December and Harvard’s Claudine Gay a month later after they were accused of being evasive under Republican questioning about how they would respond to calls for the genocide of Jews. Columbia’s president Minouche Shafik stepped down in August after also facing criticism over her handling of pro-Palestinian protest encampments. In the Aipac meeting, Scalise scolded the former university chiefs for existing in a bubble in which Palestinians were painted as the real oppressed group. “You start siding with a terrorist organization, and you think that’s mainstream, because all your friends are in this little bubble, and I don’t know who you’re talking to – you’re sure not talking to normal people any more,” he said. The congressman went on to denigrate Jewish students who engage in pro-Palestinian protest, saying they “just feel guilty that they’re alive. I don’t know how you’re brought up to where you feel, ‘I’m a Jewish student, and I’m on the side with terrorists who want to kill me.’” Scalise said Republicans were determined to confront anti-Israel protests, which he called “disgusting” and “unacceptable in America”. “We’re bringing legislation to the floor to continue to confront it, to stand up against it, to show we support Israel,” he said. The Guardian invited Scalise, Fallon and Aipac to comment on the meeting and their discussion about punishing universities for pro-Palestinian campus protests, but they did not immediately respond. Part of the Republicans’ gameplan is to use House oversight powers to investigate colleges for alleged civil rights violations. Scalise told Aipac that any college deemed to have breached the law would have their accreditation revoked. “If you have a change in administration, President Trump has made it clear day one, if you’re a college that is violating the civil rights of your students, we’re taking away your accreditation. We have that ability,” he said. Under the current system, the bulk of federal money that flows to higher education institutions comes through student loans that are in turn dependent on formal approval of the school’s academic and other standards, known as accreditation. That approval is granted by 19 accrediting agencies, independent bodies that are in turn recognised by the US education secretary. Under a second Trump administration, the education department could decertify accrediting agencies that pursue liberal policies towards campus speech and favour agencies that follow a more draconian approach. Republicans could effectively punish universities by forcing the removal of their accreditation, with potentially dire consequences. “If accreditation becomes a political tool, then the concern is it will be used ideologically to punish particular views on campus, threatening free inquiry which is the bedrock of universities,” said Mark Criley of the American Association of University Professors. The plans being laid by top congressional Republicans chimes with Trump’s own vision of a second term. In his manifesto for a return to the White House, Agenda47, he says that “our secret weapon will be the college accreditation system”. He pledges that once back in the White House, “I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics.” He would then appoint new accreditors who would defend “the American tradition and western civilization” and remove “all Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucrats”. “We are going to have real education in America,” Trump said. Trump’s vice-presidential running mate, JD Vance, has taken a similarly hard line, calling universities “the enemy” in a 2021 speech. He said he would “aggressively attack the universities in this country”. In May, Vance introduced to a bill to the US Senate which he titled The Encampments or Endowments Act. Were it passed, it would give universities an ultimatum: remove protest encampments from campus grounds within seven days, or lose all federal funding. David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the Republican vendetta against universities over pro-Palestinian protests was deeply disturbing. “That is viewpoint discrimination at its core. It’s an attack on academic freedom in its most basic form, and would raise serious constitutional concerns.”"

          "headline": "Levi Colwill finds on-field benefits of leaving Chelsea’s Cobham bubble",
          "bodyText": "For Levi Colwill, the trip to Cobham and the Chelsea training ground from his hometown of Southampton was an integral part of his childhood. Taken into the club’s academy at under-nine level, he would make the journey with his close friend Jamal Musiala, who is now at Bayern Munich; one of their parents doing the driving. That was until Chelsea transferred Musiala into local digs. They did not do so nearly as quickly with Colwill, who continued to travel up and down from Southampton, his parents never complaining, nor his younger brother, who would be in the car, too. Colwill often thinks back to those hours on the road, the sacrifices of his family, to give him motivation. The commute became rather less arduous when Colwill moved to Cobham; as he set about establishing himself as a Chelsea first-team player – a mission that he pushed in eye-catching style under Mauricio Pochettino last season and has continued to do under Enzo Maresca. Colwill has been a fixture at centre‑half for Maresca, a part of the team’s impressive start which has carried them to fourth in the Premier League. His form has brought him England selection; he is preparing for the Nations League ties against Greece on Thursday and Finland on Sunday. And, having seen Cobham as a destination for so long, it surely had to feel good to live in one of England’s most exclusive neighbourhoods. Yet it probably says everything about Colwill that he has chosen to leave the Cobham bubble, where many of his teammates live and hang out, and return to live with his family in Southampton. The 21-year-old is back to doing that drive, insisting it is OK, even though it has to take him more than an hour in each direction. Colwill can only see the upside. He feels enriched to be close to family and friends, some of whom he met at City Central Youth club where he took his early steps as a player. The off-field contentment has brought on-field benefits. “I recently moved back to Southampton so I’m around all the people I grew up with,” Colwill says. “Being connected with them again is what life is about for me. Growing up as a player at City Central with my mates was the best time of my life. I’m really happy I’ve gone back, seeing my friends and family so much more. That’s probably reflected on the pitch. “Being in the bubble when you’re at your club is great but when you come home it’s more of a peaceful, normal life. I’m with people who have normal jobs, who work 8-5 every day. To be around them shows you their side of life and makes you appreciate yours so much more. “I’ve moved back into my family home and I do the travel in every day. Everyone thinks the drive is worse than it actually is. It’s all right. No matter how long a day I’ve had, when I get back and see my dog and my mum, dad and little brother, it just means the world to me.” Colwill senses opportunity with England, even if it may not come in central defence, but rather at left-back, where the interim manager, Lee Carsley, has not called up any specialists. It is because of the dearth of them. Not that Colwill sees the role he played in the 2-0 win over Republic of Ireland in September as that of a pure left‑back. With Trent Alexander-Arnold pushing into midfield from right-back, Colwill was on the left of a back three in possession. He is asked whether people ought to stop being so obsessed with positional labels. “Yes, definitely,” he replies. “Football is changing in a way that you can play multiple positions in a game – in possession, out of possession. For me, position doesn’t matter, I’ll play anywhere to help the team and the majority of the squad think like that.” Colwill cannot help but smile when he discusses his Chelsea teammate Cole Palmer, who is with him with England – and in red-hot form. “He’s not the same Cole Palmer against me [in training],” Colwill says. “No, I’m only joking. Of course he is amazing. “You give him half a yard and it’s a goal. He’s so laid-back about it and it’s so frustrating at times because he’ll put it through your legs and score, then walk off like nothing has happened. You can’t get him back, that is the worst thing about it. Give him any chance outside the box or inside, it’s a 95% chance it will be a goal. You see that in most games.” It is no surprise to hear Colwill support Carsley’s claim to become the permanent England manager. The pair are close, Carsley having given Colwill all 11 of his England Under-21 caps. He counted on him in the summer of last year when the team won the European Under-21 Championship. More interesting is Colwill’s insight into Carsley. “He has a bit of arrogance about the team and himself in terms of: ‘We’ve got the best players in the world and we all believe that,’” Colwill says. “We can take it that next step to winning a huge competition. Cars focuses on how we are going to play and how we are going to hurt teams, which is the most important thing in football.”"

          "bodyText": "British film-maker Tom Goudsmit has chosen a quintessentially American subject for his first feature-length documentary: people seeking to better their lots by impersonating, or just pretending to be, celebrities. In this case, all three of the subjects are young black men from the hinterland of central California who impersonate the late Michael Jackson from different eras in the pop star’s life. High-voiced Chavail dresses as MJ from around the time of his early-80s album Bad; Quintin, the most diehard Jackson fan of the three, dresses as his hero in the Thriller era, and Malachi, who really wants to be a singer in his own right, covers Dangerous-era Jackson. Working as a team, they travel to San Francisco and later Los Angeles to busk on the streets or wander around nightclubs, hoping to pick up tips. It’s a tough way to earn a meagre income, and it looks like the three of them sleep in a car overnight when they make it to LA. As well as doing their choreographed dance-and-patter shtick on the streets of Hollywood near Jackson’s Walk of Fame star, they seek out an agent – any kind of agent – to help them take the act to the next level. But when they finally meet a woman who specialises in impersonation acts none of the three are thrilled with the tough home truths she has to deliver about what it will take to get ahead. If you look very closely you can see the hope escaping from their bodies for a moment, like steam from a cooling cup of tea. The film never explains exactly when it was shot, but mini-montages of the media reaction to the documentary Leaving Neverland, in which two men say they are survivors of sexual abuse meted out by Jackson, suggest this was made sometime around 2019. Even though it’s clear the three subjects aren’t terribly keen on learning about their hero’s dark side, they all agree, presumably at the urging of Goudsmit, to watch the documentary which clearly shakes, if only briefly in the case of one guy, their faith. This collision between fantasy and reality is arguably the most interesting part of the film given that you can both feel sympathy for the trio’s commitment to their different dreams but still recognise the dogged refusal to let go of their devotion, despite the mounting evidence. By adhering to a stand-back-and-watch approach, Goudsmit lets the comedy of the situation bubble naturally to the surface; in one scene, for example, Chavail, bless his cotton socks, explains how he’s considering careers as “a preacher, foot therapist, porn star, actor, salesman of some sort, host or nude model” should the Michael Jackson impersonating not work out. This being 21st-century California, it’s that third option that looks most likely by the end of the film. • The Three Michaels is on Prime Video now."

          "bodyText": "I live in central Tel Aviv, and walking around my neighbourhood I see packed cafes, restaurants and wine bars. Israel’s longest and toughest war is being fought several dozens of miles away, but our “non-stop city” has not altered its lifestyle. Last Tuesday at dusk, as news reports warned of the coming Iranian missile attack, the beach was full of surfers. But partying cannot hide the war from our minds. It is present everywhere in fading pictures of the Israeli hostages left behind in Hamas dungeons. On the lamp post down the street, I look at the image of Eden Yerushalmi, a 24-year-old Tel Avivian kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova music festival on the fateful 7 October. Her pictures are all over town, featuring her last words: “You will find me, right?” But we didn’t. Starved and tortured, Yerushalmi was murdered by her captors, with five other hostages, in late August in a tunnel in Rafah. Their horrible death was a stark reminder of Israel’s worst ever, continuing defeat. Rather than uniting the country around saving lives, as in the past, the hostages’ fate became just another battleground in our polarised, fractured society. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, would not accept what Hamas has demanded for releasing the remaining 101 hostages, half of them presumed alive. He will not stop the war, nor release incarcerated Palestinians, including the masterminds of deadly terrorist attacks, to bring home the Israelis held by Hamas. His government prefers to occupy Gaza and pave the way for Jewish resettlement there. To Israel’s Jewish liberals, Netanyahu’s refusal to “bring them home now” is another incarnation of his lifelong mission to “replace the elites”, whom he views as too cosmopolitan and condescending towards his base of socially conservative, ultra-Orthodox and ultra-nationalist Jews. Last year, after a second comeback to power at the head of a fervent rightwing coalition, Netanyahu launched a campaign to turn Israel into a theocratic, authoritarian state. The battered liberals fought back. Scores of protesters chanted “democracy” and vowed to defend the independent judiciary, the source of civil rights in a country with no constitution or common ethos. But unlike pro-democracy movements elsewhere, ours had a militaristic tone: many of its leaders and public speakers showed off their military experience and rank, to prove their loyalty to the state, and the protesters’ ace card was the threat of reservist fighter pilots not to fly under a dictatorship. It all recalled the Israel of my childhood after the 1967 six-day war, when fighter pilots and decorated soldiers were the epitome of the elite. And the movement deliberately ignored the elephant in the room that was created by that 1967 victory – the occupation of millions of Palestinians – lest the Kaplan Street marchers be smeared by Netanyahu’s “poison machine” as unpatriotic. Then came 7 October, and the overlooked conflict exploded in our faces: the total surprise by Hamas, the slaughtering and raping and looting and kidnapping in the communities around Gaza, followed by the brutal Israeli counter-offensive. Netanyahu denied any responsibility for the country’s worst tragedy yet. Overcoming its initial shock, his coalition resumed its zeal to crush civil freedoms at home and grab Palestinian land in the occupied territories. The anti-Bibists faced a conundrum. Overwhelmed by the grief and horrors of 7 October, replayed constantly in Israel’s media, they strongly supported the war against Hamas and its latest escalation with Hezbollah and Iran. The series of blows to Israel’s foe in Lebanon, culminating in the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, elicited joy and pride across the political aisle. Our pilots and intelligence were winning, less than a year after their worst debacle. But the popular war cannot overshadow the deeper sense that our government is still going after us, leading the country to disaster and using the external pretext to win the culture war at home. And it exacerbates the painful disillusionment over the antebellum mentality of living a western-style life in the liberal Tel Aviv enclave, as if the Palestinian-Israeli conflict didn’t exist. Netanyahu fuelled this self-delusion with his “managing the conflict” policy, avoiding peace or war and allowing secular Jewish Israelis to feel they were part of western Europe or the US west coast. But 7 October burst the bubble, not only on our borders, but also in our lands of inspiration. Pro-Palestinian protest on US campuses and “Free Palestine” signs in London and Paris have been a stark reminder that regardless of our self-image, many progressives in the west don’t treat us as equals, but as belligerent colonialists. This reckoning caused erstwhile Israeli liberals and leftists to “sober up” and adopt a militant approach towards the Palestinians, while still opposing Netanyahu and his bunch of zealots. The “sobered-up” couldn’t care less about the cataclysmic death and destruction in Gaza – hardly aired on Israeli television – and blame the Palestinians for their self-inflicted disaster. Some decided to leave: professors extending their sabbatical leaves, affluent families taking “a year off and then we’ll see” and young digital nomads, flocking to the new Israeli havens of Greece, Portugal and Thailand. Many more will follow them if the war brings economic meltdown. The plight of the hostages, abandoned by Netanyahu, became the rallying cry for those who chose to stay and raise the flag of Israeli liberalism against the hostile government, while supporting its fight against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. But even when the hostages are back, hopefully sooner rather than later, the conflict is not going to end. Rather than deploying more and more force, Israel needs a peaceful way out of the morass: stopping the war and leveraging its battlefield advantage to promote a two-state solution backed by regional normalisation and beginning the rebuilding of Israel and Palestine. We must heed, rather than defy, our western and Arab allies who have our back against Iran. But Netanyahu won’t listen. And his opponents keep the Tel Aviv party going while waiting, just like the prime minister, for his elusive, horizonless “total victory”.

          "bodyText": "In her first year of culinary school, Reanna Bryan, 18, was told her braided hairstyle was not suitable for the kitchen. “I was like, ‘What do you mean, you can’t have braids or dreads?’ because this is what I wear. My hair is in braids the majority of the time,” she says. When she shared her experience with the young woman’s circle she is a member of at Rise.365, a community support group based in Hackney, similar stories were echoed back. “Straight hair is the norm,” she says, “and [afro hair] is just not represented.” This discussion spiralled into an idea for a campaign to tackle one area with poor representation of afro hairstyles: emojis. There are 3,790 emojis, among them mermaids, vampires and an afro pick comb, but none feature afro hairstyles typically worn by Black people. “It’s sad and disappointing because it’s just showing how we [Black people] are not really seen in a bright light, because you’ve got a blond or ginger girl, and you haven’t got just a simple girl with an afro, braids or anything like that,” Bryan says. For Amina Gray, a youth mentor and facilitator at Rise.365, this is exactly why the campaign is important. “Black people, and women in particular, tend to have so many different hairstyles but none of these are represented. “We need to normalise that our hair – whether it’s in its natural state or it’s in a protective hairstyle – is acceptable … is professional.” To address the imbalance, Bryan and other young members of the group were asked to design emojis with common hairstyles worn by Black people. “I asked all of our young people to draw something that either reflects them or an emoji they would like to see on the keyboard,” Gray says. The group whittled it down to the four they felt best reflected the array of hairstyles in the community – braids, afro, locs and cornrows. “I always wear braids so I thought ‘let’s do braids’ because obviously that represents me. It’s like a protective hairstyle and you can have it in different ways – long, short, coloured,” Bryan says. Vanita Brown, a junior designer at Good Relations PR, helped bring the sketches to life. “Most emojis tend to reflect the majority. I feel that Black and mixed-race hairstyles weren’t prioritised in the initial designs because the creators didn’t necessarily consider or prioritise the diversity of Black hairstyles.” Proposals for new emojis can be submitted to the Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for digital typography, but only a fraction are accepted for encoding. The group will submit the designs in April. In 2019, Rhianna Jones submitted an official afro hair emoji proposal with more than 65,000 signatures from an online petition. However, it was declined on the basis that the “curly hair emoji was designed to reflect a variety of hairstyles”. That year, submissions for bubble tea and the dotted line face were accepted and released as emojis. Brown says Unicode relies heavily on proposals and feedback, such as how often terms relating to the submission are used in Google searches, to make decisions about future emojis. “This is why we’re working with Rise.365 to rally enough support to encourage Unicode to add these new emojis. Every [Google] search for the phrase ‘afro hair’ helps to make these emojis a reality.” The campaign is an opportunity to prompt discussions about hair representation and discrimination more broadly, not just emojis, Gray says. “The four we have designed are just the start. [The campaign] is a teaching opportunity. I don’t want people to think we just want emojis because we want to be represented that way. It’s because there’s a much deeper message behind it, about empowering people and helping people realise that their hair is beautiful.” Why is it important for Bryan? “My young siblings will be able to see an emoji that looks like them,” she says. “If this works, we’re actually gonna change history.”"

          "bodyText": "When I read people referring to the competition to be the next leader of the Tory party as “a beauty contest”, I reach for my red pen. It has more in common with Squid Game, the dystopian survival thriller. With the difference that the winner of this marathon elimination contest will not take home a large sum of money. The prize is to lead – I ought to say try to lead – a Conservative parliamentary group smaller in size than at any time in the long history of the party. The 121 Tory MPs will this week winnow the field of leadership candidates down from the current four to the two whose names will then be put to the party’s wizened membership. It’s been more than three months since this interminably long contest was announced. Time enough surely for Conservative parliamentarians to come to a view about the wannabe leaders. Yet, canvassing opinion among Tory MPs about who they intend to back, I find a remarkably large proportion of them replying “I don’t know”. And not because they are keeping their preference secret, but because they are genuinely uncertain at this late stage. They often have a fierce conviction about which candidate would be a disaster for their party, but there’s much less confidence that any of the contenders has the potential to be an electoral success. The rationale for holding such a protracted contest was to try to replicate what happened in 2005. David Cameron, then relatively unknown, stole past more established rivals to become leader because he was fluent, fresh and seemed to offer the most persuasive project for taking the Tories back into power. That he did five years later, albeit short of a majority. History is not repeating itself. A former cabinet minister who backed the idea of a prolonged contest groaned to me that he was beginning to regret it: “There’s no David Cameron. There’s no person everyone is pointing at and saying: ‘That’s the one!’ ” If there’s a star among the four remaining contestants, they are keeping it well disguised. None of them has been impressive enough to sweep into a commanding lead. Robert Jenrick, the shape-shifting one-time Cameron fanboy turned poster child for the hard right, looks to have the best organised of the campaigns. It is definitely the most strutting. He swaggered about the party conference in Birmingham with a large posse of adolescent understrappers. The most shameless about striking Faragesque postures, he’s unembarrassed to declare his admiration for Donald Trump. There was something very Trumpian about his reckless and unevidenced claim that British special forces are “killing rather than capturing terrorists” because of European human rights law. He also carries baggage from his time in government that smells of fish. Some of his supporters seem to be hinting that he is leaning right to win the leadership contest and will tilt back towards the centre once he’s bagged it. If the zigzag is his intended strategy, there’s a snag. His backing band includes a lot of the loons who once orbited Suella Braverman. These headbangers are not the kind of people who will forgive him for treating them as useful idiots by trying to execute a cynical reverse ferret. “The Suella gang have got him by the balls,” says one veteran of past leadership campaigns. “If he tries to tack to the centre, they’ll say we’ll destroy you.” The central case made for Kemi Badenoch by her cheerleaders is that she is “exciting”, by which they mean they think she has a bit of charisma and a gob that can grab the attention of the media. One of her flaws is to think that any publicity is good publicity. She spent much of her time in Birmingham having to explain away remarks that seemed to suggest she thought maternity pay was too generous. When you are explaining, you are losing. She then claimed that “about 5-10%” of the civil service are “should-be-in-prison bad”. Perhaps she was joking. Perhaps she meant it. I couldn’t tell. Perhaps she doesn’t know herself. One member of the shadow cabinet remarks: “The thing about Kemi is we know she’s Mrs T. The question is whether she is Mrs Thatcher or Mrs Truss.” Tom Tugendhat, the standard bearer of the one-nation tradition, is a former military man, though he prefers to keep that hush-hush. He’s a serious guy and by most accounts also a nice one, both of which may be more handicap than advantage in a Conservative leadership race. A low-octane speech to the conference lacked oratorical oomph. He can also appear to be rather thin-skinned for a job that requires the possession of a rhino-like hide. Most Tories assume he will be first to be knocked out in the voting this week. For my money, James Cleverly added momentum in Birmingham. He avoided any obvious gaffes, a surprise on the upside given his past record of filling his mouth with his feet. He was the only contender to offer any kind of apology for what the Conservatives inflicted on the country in the run-up to their eviction. At a question-and-answer session, he had a good line about his ancestry: “My mum’s family came here from Sierra Leone in west Africa in 1966 and my dad’s family came here from northern France in 1066.” His 20-minute pitch to the party on the final day was the most rapturously received of the four. He got a laugh from the more self-aware members of the audience when he told the Tory party it needs to be “more normal”. Can someone who was foreign secretary and home secretary during the ignominious fag end of the Tory years be the person to convince voters to forgive them their multiple sins? The other question asked about him is whether he has an actual plan to rescue his party or simply reckons that being cheerily blokeish will be enough. They do like to bitch about one another, do Tories. Someone who worked with him in government quips: “The name Cleverly is a violation of advertising standards.” Then again, the same Tory MP also mused to me: “I could end up voting for him.” This uncertainty about who to choose reflects confusions and contradictions in the Conservative psyche. One of the cases for taking their time before picking a new chief was to make space for a comprehensive postmortem into the worst defeat in the party’s history. Psephologists and other analysts have done some illuminating work on what inspired so many voters to loathe the Tories with such intensity. Answer: just about everything. The more serious-minded Conservative commentators recognise that the party has been in the throes of an identity crisis since the Brexit referendum eight years ago. To which I’d add, it has also suffered from an integrity crisis and a competency crisis. Yet there has been scant soul-searching. They can largely agree that being hideously and visibly divided didn’t do much for their electoral chances, but the debate hasn’t got much deeper than that. Those capable of self-criticism at the conference were heavily outnumbered by those in the grip of self-delusion. Rather than confront any of the ugly truths about their party, speakers sought and secured applause by trotting out familiar Tory tropes: slash immigration, cut taxes, bring back grammar schools. No one was brave enough to tell the Tory party how it looks to the vast majority of the electorate. There was no equivalent of the reality-confronting “nasty party” speech made by Theresa May in 2002. They talked a lot about the votes and five seats shed to Nigel Farage’s Reform. Encouragingly for Sir Ed Davey, they appeared much less interested in why they lost support and 59 seats to the Lib Dems. They much preferred to take pleasure in the early squalls besetting Sir Keir Starmer’s government than asking why the Tories were swept away by an electoral tsunami. You were barely aware they’d just gone down to a landslide defeat within the Tory conference bubble, such was its weirdly upbeat vibe. One of the new MPs, an astute head on youngish shoulders, put it down to collective denial: “We haven’t come to terms with how bad the defeat was and we haven’t come to terms with how irrelevant we are going to be.” Lurking in the back of the minds of many Conservative MPs who will be voting this week is the thought that they could soon be doing it all over again. Of the next leader, one shrewd Tory remarked: “If they fuck up, they’ll be out. It wouldn’t surprise me if there’s another leadership election in two years’ time.” There’s no such thing as a final season for the Tory Squid Game. • Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

          "bodyText": "What else is football for other than its swell of emotions? And if it was love at first sight with Jürgen Klopp, when will the Liverpool faithful fall for Arne Slot? A continued superb start to the season, top of the table when it was supposed to be Arsenal and Manchester City streaking away, he could hardly have done a better job. There remains a distance. Fans too cool for school? Possibly. A love hangover from those last days of Klopp ending so bittersweetly? Almost certainly. From Slot, there will be no touchline pogo, no bearlike screams, even if he can be demonstrative from the technical area. The will to win is still just as apparent as Klopp’s. The results so far are excellent, just two league goals conceded all season, but his horizons are far wider. “I am hoping to do more special things than only winning nine out of ten, but it’s a good start,” Slot said. He chooses to do things differently. “Whatever the outside world thinks of us we don’t really care,” said the captain, Virgil van Dijk, following a win collected with few pyrotechnics beyond Diogo Jota’s fine goal. “We want to try challenge, compete, win and be successful.” After last season’s improvements under Oliver Glasner, these are sincere struggles for Crystal Palace. They kicked off as one of five clubs yet to register a win. The wait goes on, even if their manager said “how we played in the second half encourages us.” Michael Olise is sorely missed. Eberechi Eze finds space much harder to come by. Replaced by Will Hughes in the second half, a change that brought improvement, there were only fleeting signs of the player Adam Wharton looked in spring. He did, though, play a part in the move from which Palace might have been ahead in the first minute. Wharton supplied Ismaïla Sarr, only for Eddie Nketiah to trigger the offside trap as he netted. Slot’s selection paid off for his team’s ninth-minute winner. Kostas Tsimikas had replaced Andy Robertson; the left-back’s ball found Cody Gakpo, restored to the flank role he made his name in, to slot in Jota. Liverpool’s best finisher stole ahead of Trevoh Chalobah, the Palace debutant. Three simple football decisions, each paying dividends. “You want to show what you got,” said Gakpo, after his first Premier League start of the season. For Glasner, the bad news kept rolling as the defender Daniel Muñoz limped off. Liverpool looked for a second, playing a patient fare alien during the ecstatic romance of the Klopp era. As multiple corners piled up, their players looked to Aaron Briggs, Slot’s set-piece coach, for guidance. Van Dijk headed over towards the end of a first half that had Selhurst Park mollified. The second-half Slot strategy was sitting deep, inviting pressure to trigger counters. Perhaps where he has so far lost out in affections is such dispassionate pragmatism. Glasner rejigged, Hughes and Jean-Philippe Mateta joining the attack. Palace finally began to bubble. “We could have done better in the second,” said Van Dijk. “But we knew they’d come out with a bit of pressure on the ball.” Still, Jota should have closed the contest. Trent Alexander-Arnold planted a free-kick on his head, only for the striker to head horribly wide. Would Liverpool live to regret that? Palace had a legitimate claim for a penalty when Van Dijk held Marc Guéhi with both hands, only for VAR to rule it had been “not sustained”. “A clear penalty,” declared Glasner, dismissing the PGMOL’s social media explanation. “I did read it but I don’t agree with it.” He took solace that his team had “created many chance against the best team at defending in the league”. Next, Eze forced a save from Alisson, who scrambled away the resulting corner, the last of the Brazilian’s actions. The injured goalkeeper was replaced by Vitezslav Jaros, the Czech making his first ever Liverpool appearance, Caoimhín Kelleher also absent. When Eze galloped in on goal, Jaros’s first test arrived. He saved well, clasping the ball to his chest. Liverpool could close out victory, continue that exemplary start. If the thrill of the chase is not like it was under the last guy, their chances of success are as real as in the wild and crazy years."

          "bodyText": "‘I had killed a lot of people in other films,” says Alice Lowe, whose first feature, 2016’s Prevenge, saw her play a pregnant serial killer. “This time I just felt like I should kill myself.” Agnes, the hero of Lowe’s new film, Timestalker, meets many grisly endings. Played by Lowe, she’s pursuing her dream man through the centuries, from prehistoric forests to 80s New York. But in every era, before true love can blossom, her time is cut short. Then she’s reincarnated, ready to try again. Timestalker is a romance. Or is it? It’s about reincarnation. Or is it? Just as in Prevenge, where a woman grapples with the line between truth and fantasy when she hears her foetus issuing murderous instructions, we’re invited to question what’s real as we’re immersed in Agnes’s muddled mind. The film is dreamlike: scenes have a powdery, shimmery quality and a surreal theatricality. “I wanted it to be delusional, and that you stay in that delusion, you don’t have the bubble burst,” says Lowe. “They’re all trapped. The joke with this is that people can’t change. Even though they’re her dreams, she’s still dying.” It’s funny, gory, and asks fascinating questions about obsession and the power of the human psyche. “The universe that I try to create with my films,” she says, “is dark, but not so dark you feel nihilistic.” Lowe is a woman of many talents; a writer, director and actor who’s built cult followings across comedy and horror, beginning with roles in Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace and then in Sightseers, which she wrote with Amy Jump and co-star Steve Oram and was directed by Ben Wheatley. Yet, despite this reputation – and the critical success of Prevenge, which Lowe made while pregnant in real life, Timestalker took seven years to complete. “Independent film is in so much trouble,” she says. “I had that sense during the pandemic: so many female directors do not get to make a second film.” In response to film bosses saying it takes £3m to make a first feature, she has advocated for a greater number of smaller grants to be handed out instead. “There are so many people who just need a first chance to make a smaller-budget film,” she says. “Why don’t we embrace a more punk aesthetic with how we make British films?” Looking back, the film itself reflects those anxieties. “It’s about reincarnation and hopeless love,” she says. “I think of it as a metaphor for artistic endeavour and chasing a crazy dream. It’s going to damage you, it’s going to hurt you, and you don’t really know if you’re going to get anything out of it. That is my career.” She twisted her ankle on the first day of filming, and worked long hours across a 22-day shoot in Wales, temporarily relocating her family there. “It won’t happen if you’re not evangelically obsessed with the project,” Lowe says. “If you don’t believe in it, no one else can.” Agnes embodies that obsession as she hunts down her man, despite his lack of interest. At the same time, she herself is pursued by a sinister character played by Nick Frost. When we speak, the furore around Baby Reindeer is at a peak, and Lowe suggests Timestalker is the perfect companion piece for the Netflix drama: a glimpse inside the stalker’s head. “There’s darkness there, but she’s concealing it all with fluffy rainbows and chiffon,” she says. “It’s about the chase. The fantasies are more pleasurable than the actual interactions, because the actual interactions don’t go well. To me, that’s perfect film-maker territory because most film-makers are obsessive.” Lowe grew up in Coventry, the daughter of two teachers who saw education as the path to success, but also loved watching TV. She got her own tiny black-and-white set as a teenager, and would watch it late into the night, one toe on the power button in case her parents came to tell her off. She’d devour late-night animations, Hammer horror and films like Withnail and I, plus any comedy, but especially Vic and Bob. She loved art too, but steered towards more academic subjects and earned a place studying classics at the University of Cambridge. She got involved with student theatre, making costumes and sets. Invited to audition for Peter Pan, she instead landed the role of Captain Hook’s sidekick Smee, and played it for laughs. “I was the only girl who didn’t mind looking repulsive,” she says. “I gave myself yellow teeth and spots.” She continued with devised theatre during university – its loose, improvised approach suited her – then, at the turn of the millennium, began a momentous collaboration. Starring alongside Matthew Holness and Richard Ayoade, with Paddington’s Paul King directing, Lowe became part of the comedy horror universe of Garth Marenghi, performing in two Edinburgh fringe shows that earned an Edinburgh comedy award nomination in 2000, then a win in 2001. That led to their first TV show, Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, which, 20 years on from its release, remains a cult classic. Even after this big break, there were signs it might be tougher for Lowe than her male co-stars. “I shouldn’t tell this story, but I’m going to,” Lowe says. “[On] The IT Crowd, all of the boys from Garth Marenghi were given straight offers of main roles, and I had to audition.” She was away working on a show, so the part was given to someone else; she then had to audition for a small cameo. “That typifies my career,” she says. “The opportunities that don’t get thrown your way as a woman. You can be associated with so many brilliant projects, but people will assume it’s got nothing to do with you.” Lowe has always challenged sexism when she’s seen it. “I’ve always gotten mouthy about this stuff and it hasn’t really helped my career,” she says. “There was a director who said that women weren’t funny. I complained and they fired me. It was the end of that laddie comedy era. They made me feel like I was a mad, difficult woman, but what I was saying was completely rational: you can’t say that women aren’t funny on a comedy show. You shouldn’t be in charge if you think that.” Lowe appeared in many celebrated 00s comedies, including The Mighty Boosh and Hot Fuzz, but also began making her own short films. She realised that being across every element of a project – from idea to aesthetic to sound – brought a satisfaction she’d been missing. Now, she brings that devised theatre philosophy to her sets, inviting improvisation and playfulness. “I don’t like to formalise too much what I do, because I get scared that it will actually get worse,” she says. And, as a director, she says “the atmosphere you create is going to dictate how people are treated. Why shouldn’t people be having fun doing it? People make a load of sacrifices. It’s a very antisocial job.” She says film funding bodies can get “freaked out” when a writer-director wants to star in their own film: “They’re like, ‘Oh, we assumed you’d want Kristen Stewart at this stage.’ Well I sort of do, because I love Kristen Stewart, but also I’m scared of Kristen Stewart; I’m scared of famous people.” Now, as writer, director and star, she’s able to execute her creative vision without compromise. “I read something recently saying we need to get rid of the auteur, it’s patriarchal and damaging. But can’t women just have a go though, before we get rid of it?” she laughs. “With hundreds of people contributing, you’re operating by what wins the most votes. Everything becomes the same. If you don’t have an auteur, how do we protect against being bland?” Lowe likes the idea of being “a maverick … a berserker” amid the footsoldiers of the film industry. “I’ve got an anti-authoritarian streak, for sure,” she says. That manifests in her films, where she’s drawn to “flawed heroines”. Yet she’s exasperated by the tendency to read characters like Agnes, or Ruth from Prevenge, as moral endorsement. “Agnes is not self-aware. She’s karmically naive. If you can’t let a woman be that character, that’s really sad. She’s just one character. It’s not instructions.” There is a particular pressure on female directors, who are vastly underrepresented in the industry, with only 22% of key creative positions held by women in UK film. “You get to this point of like: you are carrying the message of womankind on your shoulders, you have the responsibility to tell us what it is to be a woman. And I’m just like: I don’t want to,” Lowe says. “I’m literally going to do the opposite of what you’re expecting me to do now.” Timestalker is in cinemas from 11 October."

          "headline": "Leeds aim to burst Sunderland bubble as Meslier meets former mentor",
          "bodyText": "Illan Meslier represents one of the reasons why Régis Le Bris is now Sunderland’s manager but on Friday night he and his Leeds teammates hope to silence a packed Stadium of Light. As a teenage goalkeeper in a Lorient academy run by Le Bris, Meslier learned to fight under the tutelage of a professional boxing coach he now credits with having taught him “courage” during one-on-one clashes with centre-forwards. Significantly, Meslier also mastered the art of manipulating his body during countless hours working out on a trampoline and experienced frequent “santé mentale” sessions, designed to perfect psychological control under pressure. It all dictated that when Marcelo Bielsa threw the then 20-year-old Meslier into the Leeds first team four years ago the Breton swiftly established himself as one of the Premier League’s brightest young goalkeepers. “The mentality Lorient taught us and the maturity they gave us in the academy made it easy to adapt,” said Meslier, who was also managed by Le Bris in the French club’s reserve side. “It was so tough.” Now he and Leeds are back in the Championship under the direction of a different manager, Daniel Farke, and competing for automatic promotion with, among several other teams, table-topping Sunderland. Given that Le Bris only graduated to senior management two years ago when he took charge of Lorient’s first team, the Wearsiders’ ascent to the second tier summit, trailing a 100% home record unblemished by the concession of a single goal at home has startled England’s football establishment. Those who had muttered that Le Bris’s doctorate in human physiology and biomechanics and his diploma in the preparation of elite athletes were all very well but would be irrelevant in the EFL, have been confounded by Sunderland’s discipline out of possession, intelligent pressing and the sheer quality of their wing play propelled counterattacks. Eighteen points have not been collected from eight games by pure luck. Considering that the average age of Sunderland’s squad is 23 and the much coveted Chris Rigg, 17, and Jobe Bellingham, 19, are key components of a formidable central midfield, the near two decades the 48-year-old Le Bris devoted to youth coaching in his native Brittany are clearly coming in handy. So far at least, it seems Sunderland’s owner, Kyril Louis-Dreyfus knew precisely what he was doing in hiring one of Europe’s most renowned developers of young players to hone the youthful unpolished talent his club now acquire from across the world. A £3m buy from Birmingham, last year Bellingham was an expensive, and unusually local, recruit by current Wearside standards but is probably worth £40m in today’s market. Farke, meanwhile, clearly has considerable admiration for a manager who nurtured not just Meslier but several other high flyers including France’s Lazio, and former Arsenal, midfielder Mattéo Guendouzi at Lorient. “Sunderland are a really dangerous side,” said the German, who will doubtless be wary of the home wingers Patrick Roberts and Romaine Mundle. The latter 20-year-old, a £1m former Standard Liège forward has fitted seamlessly into Le Bris’s first XI following Jack Clarke’s £20m defection to Ipswich in August. “I’m respectful of their work. We know we have to be at our best to give ourselves a chance. Sunderland have really good shape and good players and they’re strong on the counterattack.” Although Leeds sit fifth in the Championship with 15 points, last season’s beaten play-off finalists are still coming to terms with life without Archie Gray, Crysencio Summerville and Georginio Rutter after selling that trio to Tottenham, West Ham and Brighton respectively this summer for a collective £90m. Without that triple sale the club’s owners, the San Francisco based 49er Enterprises could have struggled to remain on the right side of profit and sustainability rules. Given that the £10m former Almería winger Largie Ramazani and the £3.5m former Fortuna Düsseldorf midfielder Ao Tanaka are among those newcomers still settling in at Elland Road and only one goal has been conceded on the road it seems harsh that Farke is deemed as being “under pressure” with every point dropped. Yet with expensive plans to modernise Elland Road while expanding its capacity to 53,000 progressing apace, a swift return to the top tier seems imperative. The Leeds manager could have done without the injuries that will deprive him of his first-choice central midfielders Ethan Ampadu and Ilia Gruev for the coming weeks and betrayed a certain anxiety in conceding he “desperately needs” his No 9, Patrick Bamford back to his best following summer knee surgery. Not that Le Bris is about to underestimate Farke’s side. “They’re very strong, both in and out of possession,” he said, exhibiting a fluency in English that belies the reality he only began learning the language two years ago. “The game will be hard to win and we will have to manage it intelligently. Leeds are well managed, primed for promotion … and they have a very good goalkeeper.” As Le Bris addressed the north east media on Thursday offering an amused “tres bien” whenever a reporter managed half sentence of halting French, he smiled at mention of Meslier. “Illan’s a very good reader of the game and very strong mentally,” he said. “I like the person as well as the player so I’m very happy he’s done so well … But I hope he’s picking the ball out of his net tomorrow!”"

          "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, I found myself standing in the white marble atrium of Georgia’s state capitol building, watching a scene that encapsulated much of the presidential race. To my right: a cluster of election conspiracy theorists who still believe Donald Trump won in 2020. To my left, a group of voting rights campaigners, singing an old spiritual popularised during the civil rights era. They were here to observe last-minute efforts by hard-right officials to alter the way in which votes will be counted next month. The measures, many say, will sow doubt in this crucial swing state, creating chaos that is likely to favour Trump. A man wearing a Trump T-shirt had weaved his way into the voting rights group – most of whom were Black – and was grinning with satisfied amusement. Others started hanging pro-Trump flags behind them as police officers intervened. The conspiracy theorists – mostly white – pointed and laughed. “Isn’t it a bit disrespectful?” I asked the giggling Trump supporter to my right. “I don’t think you get to tell me what you think is disrespectful,” she said with contempt, while chewing gum. “I determine what I want to do.” In a building dotted with relics of the past – from a plaque honouring the Confederate lieutenant William Ambrose Wright to a bronze statue of Martin Luther King – there was an acute sense of the precipice on which the country now sits and the prospect of history repeating itself. First, by re-electing Trump; second, by empowering the old anti-democratic values that he has come to embody. This election has the potential to end in tragedy and farce simultaneously. For the next six weeks, I am travelling the US with the film-maker Tom Silverstone for our series Anywhere but Washington. The aim is not to predict who will win – a question that American cable news is perpetually obsessed with, but one that remains unanswerable until 5 November. Polling indicates an unwaveringly close race, not only in Georgia, but in all seven critical battleground states. Our focus, instead, is the communities with the most at stake and the policy failures and other forces guiding the doom spiral of polarisation in American politics. And we will be asking if there is hope for progress, regardless of the outcome. *** In Georgia, a centre of election denialism in 2020 and the site of Trump’s failed efforts to press officials into “finding” him enough votes to overturn the result, the microcosms for the presidential election extend well beyond the state capitol building. Out in the Atlanta suburbs, I followed a race for the 48th senate district, where a young Democrat, Ashwin Ramaswami, is running against the incumbent Republican, Shawn Still. Ramaswami, a lean, bespectacled computer science graduate, is vying to become the first Indian American gen Z state senator here. He was inspired to run, he said, after finding out that Still was charged with several felony crimes as part of an alleged plot to fraudulently seize the 2020 election for Trump. Still’s case is part of a sprawling election racketeering prosecution in Atlanta that saw him charged alongside Trump and 17 others. (Trump and Still have pleaded not guilty.) The 25 year-old’s parents beamed with pride as they discussed their son’s candidacy and told me they migrated to the US from the same region of India as Kamala Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan. “She’s going to break the ceiling,” said his mother, Kalyani. “And Ashwin is part of that.” It was in this competitive race, situated in rapidly diversifying neighbourhoods, that I found my first kernel of hope and clarity. As he canvassed on the streets, Ramaswami spoke with a young voter who was unaware that her state senator had been involved in an alleged criminal enterprise to subvert democracy. She listened attentively as Ramaswami made his pitch, which included fluid arguments for gun control and abortion rights. “We need people who are like-minded and around our age to make the difference,” she said. “Everything has to evolve. If we can evolve in our technology, why can’t we evolve in our government?” Like many other elected Republicans in Georgia, Still did not respond to our interview requests. And so, in a bid to find more voices on the other side, we drove out to the conservative-leaning county of Fayette. Here, we stumbled across a gargantuan bus, daubed in the stars and stripes and a giant portrait of a smiling Trump. The Trump Bus, as it’s called, has been rolling around the state since 2015, when its owner, Danny Hamilton, got swept up in the Maga movement. It serves as a giant billboard and a vast emporium of Trump-themed goods. He showed me the merchandise. It was largely T-shirts, caps and flags, but also included more sinister items, such as a large Trump-branded flick knife. Most of it was imported from China. I asked whether Trump’s pledge to impose large tariffs on Chinese imports concerned him. “I’m a multimillionaire,” he said, revealing this is all a personal passion project. “I don’t need this shit.” While Trumpism is a multifaceted political movement, I have found that some of the billionaire’s most ardent backers may have the least to lose in a high-stakes election. All of those congregated around the bus were well versed in the conspiracy-tinged lexicon of the Trump bubble. But talk of the two recent assassination attempts on the former president moved the needle to a new level – whereby “radical Democrats” are believed to have orchestrated the incidents. Many of the fears expressed on both sides of the aisle – of widespread political violence, targeted killings and a descent into autocratic government – might have seemed farcical four years ago. But as I looked down at the flick knife with Trump’s face emblazoned on the handle, it became clearer that they are more realistic now than at any time in recent history. • Oliver Laughland is the Guardian’s US southern bureau chief"

          "bodyText": "With ITV’s drama Joan on our screens and the bubble skirt back on the catwalks, the 80s are once again having a moment. An exhibition at London’s Fashion and Textile Museum, Outlaws: Fashion Renegades of 80s London, takes a different look – by going deep into the creative explosion on the dancefloors of the decade. It focuses on Taboo, a London club that lasted barely a year but was pivotal in the careers of people including the singer Boy George, the designers John Galliano and Katharine Hamnett, the choreographer Michael Clark and the performance artist Leigh Bowery, who started the club in 1985. The exhibition charts the rise of this cohort, from bedsits (the first room is papered with the Star Trek wallpaper that Bowery had in his flat) to national TV. A section upstairs focuses on outfits created for acts such as Culture Club, Dead or Alive, Neneh Cherry and Bros to wear on Top of the Pops. Bowery was a performance artist who made his reputation with increasingly outlandish outfits worn at Taboo and other clubs. He was painted by Lucian Freud, starred in an episode of The Clothes Show in 1986 and appeared in the window of the Anthony D’Offay gallery every day for a week in 1988. He looms large in the exhibition – and he is the focus of wider cultural interest, with an exhibition of his work planned at Tate Modern in February. There are numerous designs by Bowery here that have not been seen before, including a corseted dress he made for his friend Sue Tilley. NJ Stevenson, a co-curator of this exhibition, argues that the interest in Bowery is down to his desire for the extreme. “In club culture, the look is everything,” she says. “Nobody did more to push the boundaries than Leigh. There were lots of other people doing it as well, but he had this wild, competitive spirit, which meant that he would always do one better.” She emphasises that this exhibition goes beyond Bowery to the wider scene. There are paintings by his flatmate Trojan, owned by Peter Doig, a “dancefloor” of mannequins dressed as different characters often found at Taboo, including the designer Pam Hogg, and a room of photographs of clubs including Taboo, Limelight and Shoom. Stevenson has co-curated this exhibition with Martin Green, who also works as a DJ, and David Cabaret, a nightclub personality. She was influenced by her own relationship to nightclubs. “My generation were the ones sitting at home watching Top of the Pops on the Thursday nights,” she says. “At that point there wasn’t huge accessibility if you were a young kid living in the provinces.” She says the growth of youth TV with programmes such as The Word and The Clothes Show fed off what was happening in clubs and made it more mainstream. “Caryn Franklin [The Clothes Show presenter] used to go to Taboo. She used it as an extension of work, she would go there from the office to go and to see what people were wearing … Clubs were really people’s social media at that point. They met up every night to find out what was going on.” Even in the age of social media, Stevenson sees parallels between the 80s generation of creatives and those now. “This is very much a story of London art schools, and I think there is a bit of renaissance now with London art schools, finding places to exhibit their work and making little clubs,” she says. “There’s so very little money around. If you’re not privileged, you have to find other ways – which is exactly what they did in the 80s.”"

          "bodyText": "In 2005 or 2006, Nairy Baghramian arrived for a site visit at Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland to find the pioneering artist Gustav Metzger was there, too. He was scheduled to do a show before her and was walking around the imposing space with the director Adam Szymczyk, when he suddenly became excited at a temporary wall that had been erected. “Oh my God!” he exclaimed. “I’m very happy that this is built in now. Otherwise it would be a totally fascist building, it’s huge. I love this unterbrechung”. An unterbrechung is an interruption or an intermission. Metzger, the Jewish artist and activist who fled to the UK from Nazi Germany as a child in 1939, found the idea of disrupting this example of monumental neoclassical architecture to be politically potent. Baghramian would go on to base her whole show on that sentence. She left most of the space empty, arranging just a few pieces around that wall. At first Szymczyk questioned the decision: “Do you know how big the space is and you only have these works?” he asked. But she insisted that Metzger’s neat summation of “a political experience of a space and also an architectural experience” was the only prompt she needed. Baghramian is always looking for openings. For ways of letting the outside in. She was born in Isfahan, Iran, in 1971, and after the revolution fled to Berlin with her family in 1984. She has been exhibiting since the late 1990s, but it was taking part in the once-a-decade Münster Sculpture Project in 2007 that pushed her firmly into the spotlight. From the outset, she has made her playful, deliciously tactile work in a constant back and forth between photography and sculpture. In her latest show, portraits of a young child sit alongside sculpted elements in stone and metal. It stops her from getting stuck on any one idea: “It keeps my artistic dominance in check, so that nothing becomes too tight and everything can just be what it is.” This is more than the high-level theorising of an artist steeped in abstraction. In fact, as one critic recently put it, Baghramian’s work “pops” the very notion of art existing in a bubble. For her forthcoming exhibition, the artist is occupying the various spaces of Camberwell’s South London Gallery with large colourful sculptural pieces from her Misfits series. The show takes its title, Jumbled Alphabet, from that of a double photographic portrait of a little girl in a blue jumper, also on display. The child has tousled blond hair and yellow beads round her neck. She poses head-on (albeit from behind) and then from the side. When you can glimpse her face, you see she is looking directly ahead. It’s not that the girl looks unhappy. But she is not gurning for the camera, either. “When people take photos of children, they always ask them to smile,” says Baghramian. “But if you just leave a child be, they’ll often look the way she looks here.” With girls, she says, it’s even more common that they’ll be asked to “smile, love”. And it doesn’t end with childhood. Just a few years ago, during a shoot, Baghramian was told she had a lovely smile and why did she look so stern? In 2007, for Münster, she refused to submit a proposal. For many artists, she told the curator, it does make sense. But being asked to explain what she wanted to do in advance felt, she says, like she was using sculptures to please others. “Like you’re being asked to smile for the camera?” I ask. “Exactly.” Previous installations by the artist Misfits, 2021 (Jumbled Alphabet, 2021, on wall) These sculpted bits of marble, cast aluminium and walnut wood inhabit a gallery, Baghramian says, “as if somebody left the space without cleaning it up. You don’t know if there is an order, or if things are already out of order.” Misfits, 2021 While visiting the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Milan in 2021, Baghramian learned that the park the exhibition spaces looked out on to was reserved for children and their parents. This exclusionary inclusion – “a beautiful question”, as she puts it – resulted in a puzzle of a show that asked: Who is inside? Who is kept out? Who is in control? Scratching the Back: Drift (Tortillon orange), 2023 For last year’s Met Fifth Avenue’s Facade Commission in New York, in the niches between the pairs of monumental Corinthian columns that punctuate the main entrance pavilion, Baghramian installed this and three other buoyantly coloured pieces. They spill out at you, frozen in metal and pigment. They refuse to be subdued. Sitzengebliebene/Stay Downers: Dösender, 2020 This ongoing series of sculpted works came out of Baghramian being asked do a retrospective and declining. She wanted to make new work. She arrived instead at the idea of a sculptural class reunion for things that didn’t fit anywhere; things, as she puts it, “that have no reason to consciously meet”. She likes to exhibit these on the edges or outsides of spaces. Nairy Baghramian’s Jumbled Alphabet is at South London Gallery to 12 January."

          "bodyText": "World leaders at the next AI summit will focus on the impact on the environment and jobs, including the possibility of ranking the greenest AI companies, it has been announced. Rating artificial intelligence companies in terms of their ecological impact is among the proposals under consideration, while other areas being looked at include the effect on the labour market, giving all countries access to the technology, and bringing more states under the wing of global AI governance initiatives. France will host the next global summit on 10 and 11 February, with international politicians expected to attend alongside tech executives and experts. Anne Bouverot, Paris’s special envoy for AI, said discussions would include measuring the technology’s impact on the environment. “We’ll definitely push for more transparency by all players, and maybe a way to do that is to have a ranking or leaderboard,” she said, adding that such a system would highlight companies that are not transparent about their environmental impact. “You can very clearly say: ‘Well this company we cannot rank because we don’t have the data.’” AI’s effect on the environment has been underlined by leading tech companies, which say that developing the technology is hampering their ability to meet climate goals. Google and Microsoft have both said that their AI strategies – which rely on energy-hungry datacentres to develop and operate AI models – are endangering corporate emissions reduction targets. The conference in France will be the biggest AI gathering since the UK’s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park last November, which ended with an agreement between leading tech firms and governments on testing the most powerful AI models. The Bletchley gathering began with a joint declaration from the UK, the US, the EU, Australia and China that AI poses a potentially catastrophic risk to humanity. Bouverot added that the discussion around AI had altered since Bletchley. “The global discourse on AI has already changed,” she said. “We hear much less about the existential risks of AI, or so-called high risks. We hear about a potential bubble. We hear about what the latest developments are. That’s part of what we’re trying to do, to help change that discourse. So maybe it’s less fascinating, but it’s more concrete.” The French summit, which follows a smaller gathering in Seoul in May, will be called the AI Action Summit, with preliminary work focusing on five issues: deploying AI in public, including ensuring all countries have access to the technology; adapting the world of work to AI; trust, which includes building agreement on approaches to safety; innovation, such as tackling the issue of using copyrighted work in AI models; and global AI governance."

We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all again. Victoria University estimates international student cap will cost it over $16m in one year Victoria University (VU) estimates a loss of $16.7m in a single year as a result of the federal government’s proposed international student cap, a new analysis conducted by the university reveals. Under the caps, VU will have its numbers capped at 11% below its 2023 intake level, among 15 universities that would see international student numbers decrease. Its vice-chancellor, professor Adam Shoemaker, said it was “not a pretty picture”. Every dollar counts for a public-purpose institution like ours. This proposal will hinder VU’s ability to invest and grow our equity and excellence agenda, which directly contradicts the key intent of the federal government’s Universities Accord.” Over a third of VU students are from equity backgrounds, such as First Nations students, students with a disability and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, while almost half are first in family to go to university. Speaking at a Senate inquiry into the bill on Wednesday, the deputy Greens leader and spokesperson for higher education, Mehreen Faruqi, said Labor and Liberal were in a “race to the bottom” on education policy, labelling the proposed cap “racist dog whistling”. Gold Coast high school students hospitalised after eating mushroom gummies Two Gold Coast high school students were taken to hospital this afternoon after reportedly ingesting mushroom gummies. Paramedics attended to two boys from Palm Beach Currumbin state high on the southern Gold Coast just after 1.30pm on Wednesday. They are both in stable condition. International student cap allocations derided as ‘bizarre’ and ‘illogical’ in Senate inquiry One hundred and sixty pieces of correspondence have been sent to the Department of Education and Workplace Relations (DEWR) from tertiary education providers following the allocation of proposed federal government international student caps. At a Senate inquiry into the bill on Wednesday, DEWR said it had received a “variety of concerns and issues” from providers over their respective allocations, acknowledging there was “clearly some confusion” around the process. At least one area of the reforms – aviation schools – is under review after concerns the industry would collapse as a result of its granted caps, due to its reliance on international students to remain viable. The chief executive of the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia (ITECA), Troy Williams, told the inquiry the damage “designed in the bill” would take “years to repair”, warning it would cause thousands of job losses alongside campus closures. He said the approach to allocating student numbers to independent training providers was “nonsensical” and “irrational”, citing a lack of consultation with the sector and apparent shielding of public Tafe colleges from significant enrolment restrictions. Some independent skills training and higher education providers with a proven track record of delivering high-quality outcomes for students are allocated just three or four students under this bill. At the same time, however, a provider with no history of delivery for the past one to four years in some cases might receive an allocation of thirty. This is not just unfair; it’s bizarre and illogical. Jacinta Allan issues statement on potential October 7 protests The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has also warned against people protesting on October 7. In a statement, she said: People should not be protesting on October 7. This is a very traumatic anniversary for all those involved in the conflict. Whilst everyone has a right to protest peacefully, groups should reconsider the need to protest next week in respect to the grief it will cause Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Palestinian and Lebanese communities. SPC cannery to merge with Original Juice Company and Nature One Dairy Australia’s biggest cannery, SPC, has agreed to merge with the Original Juice Company in a three-way deal to boost the food and beverage businesses’ scale, AAP reports. The Original Juice Company announced on the Australian Stock Exchange it had reached a deal to merge with SPC and the Singapore-registered, Australian-founded dairy and powdered milk company Nature One Dairy. The deal is subject to shareholder approval and ASX requirements. The combined company is expected to deliver more than $400m in revenue this financial year. SPC has produced canned products for more than a century to Australian and global markets, but recently cut pear production as it struggled to compete with supermarket-branded products sourced from cheaper imported fruit. ABC’s director of news, Justin Stevens, has called out the racial abuse Tony Armstrong has been subjected to this week at the same time as the racism report was released. Armstrong shared screenshots of racial attacks he received online after Media Watch reported he had not told the ABC he had been employed to do voiceover for an ad campaign for one of the country’s biggest insurance companies, NRMA. Stevens: The ABC stands by Tony and will not tolerate any racist abuse. The ABC has logged the details of the abusive social media posts and made a complaint regarding the moderation of the comments. More to come. Australian Catholic University at risk of breaching international student cap due to over-enrollment The Australian Catholic University (ACU) has been warned by the Department of Education that it may be at risk of over-enrolling as a result of the federal government’s proposed international student cap. Speaking at a Senate inquiry into the commonwealth’s legislation on Wednesday, the deputy secretary of the department, Ben Rimmer, said ACU had been put “on notice” that it was at risk of going beyond its proposed cap. The inquiry has heard that the legislation is “arbitrary”, “chaotic”, “full of errors and flaws” and “made no sense” as the sector grapples with the implications of the provider-level restrictions. The Greens’ deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, Mehreen Faruqi, asked Rimmer how the department was navigating universities who, prior to receiving their indicative cap, had already enrolled more international students. “Have they been asked to stop offering places?” she asked. Rimmer said he had been monitoring very closely the number of certificates of enrolment for 2025 that had been made by each provider and in “a couple of cases” had conversations with providers about their numbers. “In the absence of legislation as yet, decisions about what to do as a result of what government is saying publicly are a matter for each provider … we have put one university on notice that they may be at risk of over enrolment.” Asked what university that was, he replied: “The Australian Catholic University.” Katter and Hanson’s parties to preference LNP in Queensland state election Katter’s Australian party will preference the Liberal National Party for the first time in a crucial north Queensland region at the state election. KAP’s state leader, Robbie Katter, has confirmed the party will ask its supporters to preference the opposition in Townsville instead of Labor at the 26 October poll. We’ve always had a position of neutrality on our preferences, and that’s because we don’t like endorsing one side or the other. But it does hit a point where you say, well, if someone’s been that bad, they need to be taught a lesson. And Pauline Hanson launched One Nation’s Queensland campaign today. The One Nation leader announced the party would preference the LNP ahead of Labor and the Greens. She told 4BC: Under Labor the state is in one hell of a mess. The Greens will definitely be last on our how to vote cards. - With AAP Woman charged following Sydney CBD protest: NSW police say they have charged a woman after a Hezbollah flag was allegedly displayed at a pro-Palestine and Lebanon protest in Sydney on the weekend. In a statement, police said: A woman has been charged as part of an investigation into a public order incident in Sydney last Sunday. Operation Shelter was established in October 2023, to ensure community safety in response to protest activity. About 10am today (Wednesday 2 October 2024), the 19-year-old woman presented herself to Kogarah police station following a public appeal. She was arrested and charged with cause public display of prohibited terrorists organisation symbol. She was granted strict conditional bail to appear before the Downing centre local court on Wednesday 23 October 2024. More info here: Sydney councillor-elect calls on police to work with City instead of going to court A City of Sydney councillor elect, Sylvie Ellsmore, has also called on police to work with the city of Sydney to manage how the protest takes place instead of taking the organisers to court: Police have the option of working with the City of Sydney to manage how public space is used for protest and other activities – they do not need to take community activists to the supreme court to do so. Police submit NSW supreme court application to block pro-Palestine rallies NSW police have applied to the sate’s supreme court to prevent pro-Palestine rallies going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Community Legal Centres NSW, Amnesty International Australia, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Jewish Council of Australia are among 40 groups urging the NSW police commissioner to reconsider the decision. Anastasia Radievska, a protest rights campaigner at the Australian Democracy Network, said: In a democratic society, communities must be able to come together and have their say through protest. The attempt to prohibit a community rally that has safely run for 51 weeks is a serious attack on the right to protest. The NSW police’s citing of flower planter boxes at Town Hall as one of their main safety concerns makes a mockery of the Form 1 process and the supreme court’s time. The Queensland opposition leader also confirmed the LNP would put local One Nation candidate James Ashby ahead of the Labor incumbent, Brittany Lauga, in the seat of Keppel. Crisafulli: We will be putting Greens and Labor last. I’ll tell you why. That does not take a lot of decision making time. In my mind, you’ve got the Labor party that’s been in power for 30 of the last 35 years. They’ve won 11 of the last 12 general elections, and they’ve been a really, really bad government, particularly the last few years. As for the Greens, they are not a movement that reflects the values of a modern Queensland. Both are contesting the seat of Keppel, which neighbours Rockhampton, where Crisafulli spoke on Wednesday. David Crisafulli claims he can meet state emission targets without renewables if elected The Queensland opposition leader has rejected claims from the state’s environmental peak body that he could not meet the state’s emissions target without renewables. The LNP’s leader, David Crisafulli, reconfirmed he would repeal the state’s legislated renewables target if elected. The head of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said reaching the mandated 75% target “will be impossible if the LNP plans to keep coal open for longer and doesn’t commit to Queensland’s renewable energy targets”. But Crisafulli said agriculture could pick up the slack: You can work with agriculture to do good, sensible use of protected areas. There is a number of ways a government can deal by working with the private sector and indeed looking up its own back yard to reduce your emissions. And Queensland’s shown that over recent years, we have shown there has been a reduction in emissions, and it’s been led largely by the agricultural sector, to its great credit … the way that Aussie farmers and Queensland farmers had embraced the change and the opportunities that come from market by being clean and green has been spot on, spot on. And we think if you’ve got a government that can partner with them, that is very, very achievable. Energy is the leading emitter in Queensland, representing 36% of the carbon inventory. Agriculture is in fourth place, representing 17%. The LNP leader has travelled to Rockhampton today to promise a new $95m academy for health sciences. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Cait Kelly will be here to guide you through the rest of today’s rolling coverage. See you tomorrow morning. NSW Health has issued a warning about high-dose MDMA, or ecstasy, tablets circulating the state, with a higher dose than usually expected. The tablets are purple shield-shaped (see below from their press release). Dr Hester Wilson, a chief addiction medicine specialist, said consuming high doses of MDMA has been linked to cases of serious illness and death in NSW: MDMA can cause severe agitation, raised body temperature, seizures or fits, irregular heart rhythm and death. Other risks include taking MDMA in combination with other stimulants, such as amphetamines or cocaine. The amount of MDMA in a tablet or capsule can vary significantly, even within the same batch. The health risks from MDMA are greatly increased if high amounts (including multiple doses) are consumed over a short period. Wilson also said hot environments, such as music festivals, increase the risk of harm from MDMA, encouraging people to take a break from dancing, seek shade and drink water. Fears spike about public sector workplace corruption Almost one in three Victorian public sector employees think corruption is a problem in their workplace, according to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission’s latest perceptions of corruption survey. As AAP reports, the survey was released today and collected more than 9,000 responses from Victorians aged 16 and older – including public sector workers, local government employees, Victoria police members and business suppliers. Roughly nine out of 10 agreed corruption happens in Victoria, the report said. On average, a 19-percentage point gap exists between those agreeing corruption happens versus [those that] perceive that corruption is a problem, suggesting a widespread tolerance for certain types of corruption behaviours. Across the groups, there has tended to be an increase since 2022 in the proportion viewing corruption to be a problem in Victoria. Here’s the full story from Mostafa Rachwani, on news Sydney police told organisers of a pro-Palestine rally this weekend they had safety concerns over the expected crowd size and potential hazards at Town Hall – including “the recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes”. Legal activists say right to protest ‘must be protected’ The Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) is calling on the NSW police commissioner to drop supreme court applications attempting to prevent two pro-Palestine rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. In a statement, the HRLC said that any approach that “demonises and punishes thousands of people for the actions of a few is disproportionate and a breach of human rights”. David Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the HRLC, said the right to protest is “fundamental to our democracy and must be protected.” While NSW police may seek to restrict or ban the protest, they must be able to show that these actions are both necessary and proportionate, in line with international human rights and constitutional standards. Overly broad restrictions on our right to get together peacefully must not be NSW police’s first response; instead, authorities must focus on facilitating these rights and freedoms. Mejia-Canales said that blanket bans on protests are “disproportionate” and that restricting and prohibiting protests should “only ever be a measure of last resort.” NSW police must prioritise less intrusive measures and consider allowing the protest to go ahead. If there is poor behaviour by individuals, then this should be dealt with accordingly while allowing everyone else to peacefully protest. The Bureau of Meteorology has shared this satellite view of southwest WA, where a severe weather warning remains in place. A strong cold front will sweep the region today, with an associated deep low pressure system and trough to follow in its wake. Widespread damaging winds around 60-70km/h with peak gusts around 100km/h are forecast across the coastal fringe south of Jurien Bay from this evening. This system is expected to be windier than typical and unusual for this time of year, the Bureau said. Aussies unprepared for money shocks, according to survey Less than a quarter of Australians are satisfied with their financial position, with younger generations increasingly relying on grandparents for support. As AAP reports, research conducted by investment group MLC found 70% of people said financial wellbeing was important to meeting life goals, but only 23% were happy with their money situation. MLC’s financial freedom report, which surveyed more than 2,500 people, found just 25% of respondents were prepared to handle unexpected financial challenges. Some 41% of respondents said they worried about their finances all the time or often. The findings also showed grandparents were playing a larger role in helping younger generations financially, with more than half saying they are assisting monetarily or plan to do so. The findings showed 60% of those in Gen Z received financial support from grandparents – along with 56% of millennials – when they reached adulthood. That compares with 20% of generation X and 6% of baby boomers. Those in generation X were the most likely to worry about cost-of-living issues, followed by generation Z, millennials and baby boomers. SPC to merge with Original Juice owner Canned fruit giant SPC Global is planning to merge with the Original Juice Company (OJC) in a deal designed to create a large food conglomerate, with increased Australian manufacturing capability. The deal, which requires approval from OJC shareholders, also includes folding powdered milk products company Nature One Dairy into the new company, according to an ASX release issued today. The 100-year-old SPC, a major employer in Victoria’s Goulburn Valley, is the biggest company of the three and its chief executive, Robert Iervasi, will lead the merged entity. With our market-leading packaged fruit, canned tomatoes and baked bean products, we are excited to expand with OJC both domestically and globally and see significant synergy potential in bringing the two producers together. Best known for the aforementioned canned fruit and baked beans, SPC also produces ready-made meals. The ASX-listed OJC owns several juice brands, including Original Juice and The Juice Lab. OJC is chaired by the former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who will step down from his role after the transaction is finalised. The combined business is expected to generate more than $400m in annual revenue, OJC told shareholders. Woman charged for allegedly causing fires at cemetery chapel and sheds Western Australian police have charged a 28-year-old woman for allegedly setting fire to items inside a chapel. It will be alleged the Mandurah woman forced entry into the Norfolk chapel at Karrakatta cemetery yesterday and set fire to items inside, with the resulting fire causing an estimated $1m damage to the chapel. Police will further allege the woman set fire to a shed at a cemetery in Parklands on 27 September, with the shed and its contents destroyed. Police allege the woman set another fire in a small shed at the same cemetery in Parklands on 30 September. The woman has been charged with one count of burglary and three counts of criminal damage by fire and is due to appear before the Perth magistrates court today. Anne Hollonds says systems outside of youth prisons ‘need to be doing their job’ Back at the National Press Club, Anne Hollonds told a story about visiting what she thought was the best youth justice facility in the country, with 24 children. She didn’t say what state it was located in, but that she was “really impressed” and asked the principal what happens to the children when they leave? The principle said that was “a problem”, Hollonds said, explaining: She said, ‘They go back to their community and they try to re-enrol back in the school, and often the school doesn’t want them.’ She said that to me. ‘The school does not want them.’ Or they start going back to school, but they’re not getting the one on one learning support they need. These kids, they may have dropped out of school about the age of eight or nine. They have missed years and years of schooling. So she said ‘they drop out, and then they come back, and they come back, and they come back.’ … And so it’s a failure … of the systems outside the prison. So even the state that I mentioned, that had the small therapeutic unit, they can’t fix all this on their own. They need the systems outside the prison to be doing their job, and that’s not happening. The NSW Friends of Palestine group have written to the NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, urging the government to help find a compromise with NSW police and allow this weekend’s planned pro-Palestinian protests to go ahead. As the Guardian’s Mostafa Rachwani reported this morning, NSW police plan on applying to the state’s supreme court to prevent the protests going ahead on the grounds of safety concerns, a move protesters say is an attack on the fundamental democratic right to protest. The Labor group are appealing to Catley to find a middle road. In a letter sent to the police minister, Labor members said “rank and file ALP branch members have demonstrated consistent support for the Palestinian people through branch and conference resolutions, fundraising for humanitarian aid, and through participation in the weekly rallies” and that Labor Friends of Palestine members “have participated in every Sydney rally for the last 51 weeks”. In a letter seen by Guardian Australia, Louisa Romanous wrote on behalf of the group: Over that time, we have found the rallies to be peaceful and well-organised. We acknowledge that last Sunday’s rally had a different tone – born out of the shock and distress arising from Israel’s attacks on Lebanon. Members of the Australian-Lebanese community expressed their profound grief and pain in many different ways, with a very small number flying Hezbollah flags. Notwithstanding the heightened emotions, at no time did the rally feel unsafe or violent. The NSW police announcement that they will seek to prohibit this week’s rally seems a disproportionate response to the actions we observed at the rally, and prohibiting a rally on such a key date is a profound attack on political expression and the right to protest. The group said “Labor governments should protect peaceful protest as a critical feature of social democracy and progressive politics” and urged Catley to “intervene in this matter and work constructively with police, rally organisers and affected communities to facilitate an outcome that will allow a peaceful rally and march to occur as planned on Sunday 6th October in Sydney”. Children’s commissioner says minister for children would improve coordination The children’s commissioner, Anne Hollands, has been taking questions following her speech at the National Press Club. She was asked about her call for a minister for children: why was it not sufficient to simply have the existing minister for youth? Hollonds noted the work the youth minister is doing, but said she wants to see a minister for children in cabinet as well: Not because that person can fix it on their own, by the way, because having someone – it would make my life easier, I would have one minister to talk to, not fifty million – but at the moment there’s no coordination. That minister would ideally work with colleagues to ensure we get better coordination and work with the jurisdictions on these sorts of reforms we’re talking about. A NSW police letter to organisers of a pro-Palestine rally planned for Sunday at Sydney’s Town Hall says the force has concerns for the safety of participants and the general public given the size of the expected crowd and hazards within the precinct including “the recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes” for spring. The force also notes the potential impact of the rally on other users of the Town Hall precinct including light rail commuters and attendees at the nearby St Andrews cathedral. The police letter to the organisers does not mention the potential presence of prohibited images such as the Hezbollah flag which was allegedly displayed at last Sunday’s protest in Sydney’s CBD. The NSW Greens justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the move by NSW police to ban this weekend’s protests at Town Hall was “oppressive.” It is a harsh and oppressive move by the NSW police force to attempt to prohibit the peaceful, uninterrupted weekly assembly where people have been expressing their collective grief and support of the Palestinian people suffering the most horrific genocide. To learn that the reason for this undemocratic intolerance of the people’s right to protest is [partly] due to a few planter boxes on the street is cruel, callous and frankly dangerous. After a meeting yesterday morning with organisers, NSW police said they were “not satisfied that the protest could proceed safely” and signalled they would apply to the NSW supreme court to have Sunday’s protest banned – along with another event scheduled for Monday. Anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen says visa to Australia has not been granted Kellie-Jay Keen, aka Posie Parker, has ditched plans to appear at the conservative talkfest CPAC Australia in Brisbane this weekend after she said her visa to Australia had not been granted. The “gender-critical” activist from the UK, who made headlines in Australia last year when her rally outside the steps of parliament was gatecrashed by nazis, posted on X she was not flying to Australia in the morning due to a visa not being granted and she would instead be watching the live stream of the defamation trial brought by Liberal MP Moira Deeming against state Liberal leader John Pesutto over comments made about her attendance that rally. CPAC Australia also claimed on its website the talk had been “CANCELLED VISA REFUSED” [sic]. But it is understood the Department of Home Affairs was still considering the visa application from Parker and no refusal had been issued. CPAC Australia was approached for comment. The headline act for CPAC Australia will be former UK prime minister Liz Truss. Other speakers include Warren Mundine, Senator Alex Antic, Senator Bridget McKenzie, Senator Matt Canavan, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and Senator Gerard Rennick. More from Anne Hollonds’ national press club address Anne Hollonds is calling for the government to appoint a cabinet minister for children and to establish a ministerial council for child wellbeing that reports to national cabinet. She said Australia ratified the convention on the rights of the child in 1990 but “unlike other countries, we have no legislation to underpin the responsibilities we have signed up to”: There is currently noone held responsible, for example, when the conditions in detention are breaching international human rights conventions. And this was made clear at a recent inquest into the tragic death by suicide of young Cleveland Dodd. Hollonds argued the concept that children have human rights is “not well understood” in Australia: You never hear children’s rights talked about in question time, or on the news. But you’ll hear about workers’ rights, women’s rights, consumer rights, for example. The term children’s rights, well, it doesn’t really roll off the tongue, does it, in Australia. And that helps to explain why we continue to see breaches of human rights, and in child justice system. It’s getting worse, not better, and it has to stop. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Commissioner says some politicians told her: ‘there’s no votes in children’ Circling back to the National Press Club, where the children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, has been speaking. She said that when she has raised issues of youth justice with members of Parliament, some have said “there’s no votes in children”: The truth is while we may all be shocked in the moment when there’s a tragedy reported in the media – and there’s just about every week – these serious failures and systemic neglect of children do not seem to affect a party’s political fortunes at elections. Despite the economic costs and the questionable morality of strategies contrary to the evidence, when I ask about lack of progress on reform, I’m told by some members of Parliament there’s no votes in children. Attempts to stop pro-Palestine rallies in Sydney ‘deeply anti democractic’, Greens senator says Greens senator David Shoebridge has labelled the move by NSW police to try to stop pro-Palestine rallies from taking place in Sydney as “deeply anti democratic”. In a post to X, Shoebridge said the protests have been held weekly for 51 weeks and have been “overwhelmingly peaceful,” with families and the community coming together to “mourn their loved ones and call for the end of violence.” The organisers were in discussions with police on how to hold the protest and keep the community safe but then found out via the media that police were trying to block it! It’s a deeply anti-democratic move. Children’s commissioner ‘shocked and distressed’ after visiting youth detention centres Continuing from our last post: Anne Hollonds said that what she saw during visits to the nation’s youth detention centres left her “shocked and distressed”. As AAP reports, she told the audience: What was most chilling for me was to meet children who had no one, who were completely alone, who spoke of feeling shut out and shunned by society. These children were unable to tell me about any hopes or dreams or plans for the future. All they could see in their future was more of the same but in adult prison. Barely literate, their lack of education or training gave them no prospects for a job, and they had no one to help them. The light had gone out of their eyes. The children’s commissioner warned unless the nation started paying attention to the evidence, the community would be having the same conversation in a decade’s time, only with a lot more tragedies along the way. Australia can be ‘smart on crime’ by acting on the evidence, dealing with the barriers to reform, and building safe communities where children can get the best start in life. Children’s commissioner addresses National Press Club The national children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, has begun addressing the National Press Club in Canberra. As AAP reports, Hollonds is making the case that Australia must abandon its tough approach to managing youth crime and start looking to evidence-based solutions – including earlier intervention to help save children from “disadvantage, despair and desperation”. Youth detention centres are the places where the most egregious breaches of the human rights of children are happening. Australia cannot continue with “business as usual” and should ditch its failed approach of longer sentencing, more policing and more children’s prisons, she said. Instead, it should look to change youth justice to improve child wellbeing. After the child protection system, often the next station on the train line for them is the criminal justice system. More activists sought over violent anti-war protests The search for anti-war protesters wanted over clashes outside a controversial Melbourne weapons expo has stepped up, AAP reports. Images of eight people – seven men and one woman – have been released after the unrest triggered by the Land Forces expo on 11 September. Rocks, projectiles, liquids, horse manure and eggs were hurled at officers, horses and expo attenders, police say. Twenty-seven officers were injured and about 12 horses were exposed to various substances. Victoria police said in a statement today: Several police horses and riders were splashed with a liquid irritant including being sprayed under face protectors, going into their mouths and nostrils, and were repeatedly pushed and hit with plastic crates. Riot officers returned fire on the 1,500 demonstrators with rubber bullets, teargas and flashbang devices. Activity over the following two days of the expo was less volatile. Eighty-nine people were charged or issued fines, with police setting up an investigative team to track down more offenders. They have also released an image of a man wearing a blue shirt and keffiyeh after a council bin was set alight on Spencer Street. The chief commissioner, Shane Patton, defended his officers’ use of force against the protesters, who he called “a bunch of hypocrites”. He said at the time: “They come here to protest against anti-war, so presumably [they are] anti-violence.” The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, says the “dangerous escalation” in the Middle East requires “people and governments around the world to keep pushing for peace through taking action.” In a series of posts to X, Bandt said underlying the conflict is “the state of Israel’s continued illegal occupation of Palestine” and “until this ends, there will be no just [and] lasting peace for Palestinians, Israelis and their neighbours.” He said that Labor “must do more than simply call for a ceasefire” and should pressure the Netanyahu government “with sanctions and an end to military trade”. This is what can help end the cycle of violence … The Greens continue to call for the release of the hostages, an end to the invasion of Gaza and Lebanon, and an end to the illegal occupation of Palestine. More on the evacuations from Lebanon More Australians have left Lebanon after the Israeli military strikes, however, the government is continuing to warn people to move quickly. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says staff are continuing to work with allied nations, including the UK and Canada, to help Australians leave Lebanon. A Dfat spokesperson says the time to act is now: A number of Australians were assisted onto commercial flights on Monday and overnight. Further seats have been secured on additional flights on Thursday and we are working to access more flights over the coming days. The Australian embassy in Beirut remains open and for the meantime there are still commercial options, although contingency plans are in place. However officials have warned people not to wait any longer if they want to leave. The Australian government understands this is a distressing time for many who are being impacted by the conflict. We urge Australians in Lebanon to take the first opportunity to leave. Please do not wait for a preferred route. There is estimated to be about 15,000 Australians in Lebanon although the government does not have exact numbers. More than 100 airline seats secured for Australians fleeing Lebanon AAP has reported more than 100 commercial airline seats have been secured for Australians trying to leave Lebanon as dire warnings continue for people to evacuate amid an escalation of conflict in the region. Flights across Monday and Tuesday carried dozens of Australians out while another scheduled flight for Thursday will add to the tally. It comes as Australians in Lebanon are urged to take any available option to get out of the country as the security situation deteriorates following an increase in missile strikes across Lebanon and Israel. The federal government continues to work on contingencies to evacuate citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families from Lebanon should the situation deteriorate further. But grave warnings have been issued that any effort cannot accommodate the some 15,000 Australians in the country, although exact figures are unknown. There’s a new report out from NRMA Insurance looking at the road ahead for electric vehicle adoption in Australia. It says EV sales have grown in Australia, from less than 1% of new car sales in 2020 to 8.5% of light vehicle sales in 2023. Uptake has been strongest among drivers with annual household incomes over $200,000, families with children and those in capital cities. Currently 5% of Australian drivers own an EV. The two biggest drivers for purchasing one were sustainability reasons, at 77%, and affordability, at 76%. But one of the biggest barriers is an “image problem”, the report states, with “petrol and hybrid vehicles are seen by many purchasers as being superior vehicles to EVs.” Some of barriers to buying an EV among non-considerers were vehicle attributes (82%), infrastructure (64%), cost (63%) and safety (51%). 44% also listed the risk of battery fires as a concern, even though research shows road registered EVs do not present a greater risk of fire than internal combustion vehicles. NRMA CEO Julie Batch says the report highlights the work needed to bust the myths about range anxiety, safety and cost. The report is based on research involving 2,079 interviews conducted in February. Victorian minister says protesters should ‘think twice’ about holding rallies on 7 October Victoria’s assistant treasurer and minister for transport, Danny Pearson, says pro-Palestine protesters should “think twice” about holding rallies on the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Speaking to reporters, Pearson said 7 October will be an “incredibly challenging and difficult day for many members of our community.” I would really encourage people to really think twice about whether that’s a day where these sorts of activities should be occurring. This is a day of immense trauma and grief for many in our community ... I don’t think a protest is an appropriate way to mark a day of grief and trauma. In Melbourne, a pro-Palestine rally is planned for Sunday, the day before the anniversary. For more on this topic, our reporter Tory Shepherd has put together an explainer on what Australian law says about the display of hate symbols, and if we need any new legislation – as Peter Dutton has been calling for. More information on arrest of woman in Sydney NSW Police have made their first arrest as part of their investigations into people allegedly holding Hezbollah imagery at the pro-Palestine protest last Sunday. At around 10am this morning, a 19-year-old woman presented herself to Kogarah Police Station following a public appeal for her to come forward. Police said in a statement she was arrested and is currently assisting police with inquiries. The Guardian understands she has been arrested for the alleged display of Hezbollah imagery, which the police have described as “prohibited symbols”. She was arrested as part of Operation Shelter’s investigation into the protest, with the taskforce established to “ensure community safety in response to protest activity.” Investigations continue. Victoria police say they have no powers to halt a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne this weekend, ahead of the anniversary of the 7 October attacks in Israel. A spokesperson says the police will have a presence at the Melbourne rally on Sunday, a day before the anniversary. The spokesperson says the focus will be on ensuring the safety of those attending and the broader community: Victoria Police respects the right for peaceful protest, however any unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated. Victoria Police does not have the power to deny a protest from occurring, so long as it is lawful. There is no permit system for protests in Victoria. A woman has been arrested as part of an investigation into a public order incident at a protest last Sunday. About 10am today, the 19-year-old woman presented to Kogarah police station following a public appeal for information. Earlier, NSW police released images of a woman and said she might be able to assist with inquiries into the alleged display of prohibited symbols at the protest. She has been arrested and is currently assisting police with inquiries. Shorten pleads with Australians to ‘live and let live’ Retiring federal minister Bill Shorten has urged Australians deeply distressed about events in the Middle East to “live and let live” and not to prosecute their arguments in ways that break Australian law. At a news conference alongside prime minister Anthony Albanese in Shorten’s Melbourne seat of Maribyrnong, the minister echoed Albanese’s concerns about public demonstrations planned for this weekend to mark a year since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel. I respect that people from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Lebanon, from Israel, feel really strongly and they’re going through pain, which the rest of us who don’t have family there can’t even begin to understand. But people shouldn’t bring their arguments to this country and disrespect our laws. He and Albanese both acknowledged that the October 7 attacks represented the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. Albanese, who earlier indicated he will attend a vigil for Israeli victims of the attacks in Melbourne, urged people to rethink plans to stage public protests (see earlier in the blog). Shorten endorsed Albanese’s comments and asked: Can’t we just live and let live here and try the best we can to maintain harmony? New study aims to improve health outcomes for NSW prisoners Researchers will examine how to improve the “health literacy” and provide better care for New South Wales prisoners, particularly those who are Aboriginal, in what the state government says is a world-first study. The Minns Labor government has announced a $500,000 grant for Justice Health NSW (JHNSW), the agency responsible for providing healthcare to people in the criminal justice system. The purpose of the study is to work out how to provide prisoners with better and more equitable access to health information and services, including to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. The government hopes to improve health outcomes for prisoners and in turn reduce the need for more expensive acute care. The study will be led by JHNSW’s Dr Julia Bowman and Swinburne University’s Professor Richard Osborne. It follows previous research that found people incarcerated in NSW prisons, particularly Aboriginal people, have poorer health outcomes and lower health literacy than those in the wider community. In a statement, the state minister for Aboriginal affairs, David Harris, said: While there are many strengths in the current service provision for people in prison, there is an opportunity to better address the specific needs of Aboriginal people. This grant will fund an extensive co-design process to build on existing strengths and further enhance the overall health of people in NSW prisons. China’s green tech investment tsunami could lap Australian shores, report says There’s no doubt China has grabbed market leadership in many of the technologies we need to decarbonise our economies, from solar panels and wind turbines to electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. Australia stands to benefit from those advances and potentially from soaring outbound investment in low-emissions technology, according to a new report by Climate Energy Finance, out today. Since 2023, US$100bn (A$145bn) of Chinese investment has poured out of China into at least 100 deals, a flow of funds that Australia has partly benefitted from, with more to come, the report finds. A 1.4 gigawatt windfarm with a big battery is one such project. However, barriers to Chinese money – including foreign investment approvals – have meant “Chinese private investment in Australia is weak relative to the rest of the world”, the report by Tim Buckley and other authors says. It makes geopolitical and economic sense for Australia to find a strategic way to work with our biggest trading partner and the region’s major power, while navigating the challenges and risks Chinese technology and manufacturing expansion and its global critical minerals supply chain dominance pose. Others, though, say Australia may have to choose between teaming up with the dominant clean energy supply or joining the US, the European Union and other regions (eg India) in trying to push back against that dominance. That dilemma will play out in Albanese government plans for a $1bn solar panel plant in NSW’s Hunter Valley. The most likely route of success would be to lure one of China’s huge solar firms but that would then run counter to efforts to reduce reliance on a nation that supplies as much as 90% of the global market. One thing for sure, though, the world needs to accelerate decarbonisation, one way or another. Fourth-hottest Australian September on record Peter Hannam has shared a few graphics on September’s national weather. As is pretty much a given, the month was warmer than the 1961-90 benchmark, and by mean temperatures (that average out maximums and minimums) it was the fourth hottest on record. And here’s those maximums – with September 1.9C on average warmer than the 1961-90 gauge: Minimums were notably above average across much of the country, and at record warm levels in the north-west: Those overnight temperatures were warm because there was a lot of cloud around, producing a record wet September for a large chunk of that north-west region. And the relatively warm September followed a “gobsmackingly” hot August, which shattered records for that month. Albanese on Dutton: ‘not strong to not understand there’s a separation of powers in this country’ Anthony Albanese was asked whether he agrees with comments from the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, accusing Peter Dutton of seeking to “throw more kerosene on the fire” on public debate around the Middle East conflict. The PM told reporters: Peter Dutton has never seen an issue in which he does not seek to promote division. And that is the characteristic that Peter Dutton has had his entire political career. It’s not strong to not understand that there’s a separation of powers in this country. As Dutton flagged earlier, Albanese confirmed he spoke with Dutton on Saturday to provide a briefing on the situation in the Middle East and on domestic security concerns. The prime minister also commented on the alleged display of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend, and said: The Hezbollah flag is quite clearly a hate symbol and should not be displayed here in Australia. Anthony Albanese says he believes 7 October is not a time for demonstrations to occur. Speaking about the protests planned for 6 and 7 October, he told reporters: What I would encourage at all times is for there to be appropriate moderation. These are difficult times. I understand that, for many Australians with family – be it in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, or in Lebanon, this is a very difficult time. It’s not a time to raise temperature. It’s a time to try to make sure that social cohesion in Australia is valued. So October 7, I think, is not a time for demonstrations to occur. Because it will be perceived as – whether that’s the intention or not – as being something that is less than an appropriate commemoration of the atrocities that occurred on October 7, and it will do nothing to advance the cause. Albanese is asked if Australia supports Israel’s efforts to ‘take out Hezbollah’ Asked if Israel must disable Hezbollah to defend itself, and if the Australian government supports Israel’s efforts to “take out Hezbollah”, Anthony Albanese responds: We regard Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation, as we regard Hamas as a terrorist organisation. We have been working with like-minded countries and issuing appropriate statements, such as the one that I referred to. This is the statement he was referring to: Prime minister addresses media from Melbourne The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking to the media from Melbourne. He reiterated the call for a de-escalation to the conflict in the Middle East and said: We’re very concerned about Iran’s actions, which is why we condemn them. It is a good thing that it would appear that the defence of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There’s been too much loss of life in that region … Israel, of course, has a right to defend itself. What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others. Queensland opposition leader hits back at premier’s public power promise The Queensland opposition leader David Crisafulli his back at the premier’s power retailer announcement at an event in Brisbane. (We covered this earlier in the blog, here). The LNP leader called the plan “a desperate thought bubble “. The solution is state owned generators running at capacity, not more, state owned retailers running off with your money. And I want to give you certainty that what Queenslanders want is security when it comes to energy; a maintenance guarantee on our assets. What they don’t need is a distraction to take away from ten years of bad planning that has meant that you are paying more for your electricity. Speaking at day two of the AgForce agricultural industry conference, Crisafulli announced a $30m agricultural innovation fund. Dutton says he was briefed by director general of national security Peter Dutton said he received a briefing from the director general of national security a couple of weeks ago in Canberra. We had a discussion, obviously, around the Middle East, as well as on other topics. The opposition leader said he has asked his office to organise briefings from the director general of Asio and Defence, “if the government deems it appropriate” and with the head of Asis as well. I had a conversation with the prime minister on the weekend, and I was sent a piece of intelligence in relation to – which is at a fairly high level, but nonetheless, I appreciated that update as well. Dutton says Minns ‘has shown leadership’ over pro-Palestinian protests Q: If NSW police fail to block pro-Palestinian protests in Sydney, how should police respond? Should they go out and arrest people who turn up? Peter Dutton said he pays credit to NSW premier Chris Minns “who I think has shown leadership in relationship to this particular issue, and I think that’s recognised in the Jewish community as well.” (You can read Minns’ comments earlier in the blog here). Dutton said he hoped Victorian police would follow suit with NSW police in applying to court to stop the protests. That is not an anniversary that should be celebrated. Dutton claims PM’s response to Iran strikes ‘has made it more precarious for us here’ The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking to reporters and commented on the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Dutton said he “condemn[s] absolutely” the actions of Iran, and argued “the way in which the prime minister has responded, or has not responded here, has made it more precarious for us here in Australia as well.” The prime minister should be standing up, as the United States has stood up overnight, as the United Kingdom has, as Canada has, to condemn the actions and to make sure that decisions are made to keep us safe here in Australia as well. Earlier this morning, Anthony Albanese said the Australian government condemns the attack on Israel by Iran as an “an extremely dangerous escalation”. He also said there “does at some point need to be a diplomatic solution here.” You can read his full comments here and here. Police want to speak with woman regarding alleged display of prohibited symbols at protest NSW police have released images of a woman they believe can assist with investigations into a public order incident in Sydney last Sunday. The investigation is part of Operation Shelter, which police launched in October 2023 to “ensure community safety in response to protest activity.” In a statement NSW police said the woman might be able to assist with inquiries into the alleged display of prohibited symbols last Sunday. The woman is described as being of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern appearance, of medium build, with long brown hair, wearing all black clothing and black sunglasses. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Premier backs NSW police bid to stop pro-Palestine rallies from going ahead The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, says he supports the police’s decision to apply to the supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Speaking to reporters earlier this morning, he said: I want to make it clear, we completely support police’s decision in relation to that application. The reasons are, it’s the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack in Israel. Obviously, community anger and concern on the streets is heightened as a result of that anniversary. It’s also in the middle of the school holidays. The protests and march was scheduled to take place in the evening. It’s a long weekend in Sydney, and the police … [believed] that there was a high prospect of conflict on the streets of Sydney. Special envoy on antisemitism responds to Iranian missile attack on Israel Jillian Segal, the special envoy on combatting antisemitism, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning after the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Segal said she is “very concerned about what we are seeing on our streets” in Australia, and pointed to the alleged display of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend: I think that was truly shocking for the Jewish community, and should be shocking for the general community, because we must challenge terrorism. Segal said that if the current legislation isn’t strong enough to address this, “then we need to revise them”. You can read more about this below: Segal also said she plans to set up a meeting with the special envoy on combatting Islamophobia, Aftab Malik: I think it’s very important that we work separately with our communities and with the general community, and we work together, because we’re all about reducing antisemitism, reducing hatred, and increasing social cohesion. And we need to put our heads together and work with the community as a whole, and try and bring about that situation here where what happens in the Middle East does not undermine our social cohesion here in Australia, and I think that’s everyone’s wish. Queensland premier Steven Miles would create a publicly owned “people’s” energy provider in a bid to drive down power prices if his government is re-elected later this month. The promise comes on day two of the sunshine state’s election campaign with Miles in the north Queensland city of Mackay – a seat held by Labor for more than a century. Miles posted on social media: The people’s provider will ensure households and businesses reap the benefits of that – not foreign shareholders. We know how important it is to make energy bills cheaper for Queenslanders. It’s simple – people before profits. UNHCR’s Australia chief says thousands of people looking for shelter in Beirut Trudi Mitchell, the CEO of the UN Human Rights Council in Australia, says an estimated 1 million people have been displaced within Lebanon amid the conflict in the Middle East. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Mitchell described the situation as “terrible for innocent civilians”. We’re hearing that people are sleeping on the ground and that, in Beirut, there’s thousands of people just looking for shelter right now. Asked what message UNHCR has for the Australian government – in terms of its role with partner countries in pushing for de-escalation – she said: Obviously we want a political solution to this situation. Without that, we need support from a humanitarian aid perspective, and we ask that of the government, and we welcome that from the government as well as the Australian general public. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has responded to reports that NSW police have applied to the state’s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. In a post to social media, Faruqi wrote: Peaceful protests against Israel’s genocide have been happening weekly for almost a year now. This is silencing dissent. Anthony Albanese has declined to describe the rapidly shifting events in the Middle East as a “war”, choosing instead to call it “an escalation of the conflict”. Asked on ABC Radio in Melbourne why he wouldn’t call it a war, Albanese repeated his description and said: I don’t want to get into a definitional argument. What you have is a tragedy. The prime minister said diplomacy “cannot succeed” in an escalating conflict but that must be the ultimate objective. There does at some point need to be a diplomatic solution here. On the reported plans for public gatherings over the weekend to mark one year since the 7 October Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Albanese said there should not be “anything that looks like a celebration” because it would cause disharmony and was inappropriate. He confirmed he would attend a vigil in Melbourne and declined to say whether pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel gatherings, including vigils, should be cancelled, saying those decisions were a matter for police and they had his backing. Albanese also confirmed that the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, would no longer be travelling to Israel to represent Australia at commemorative events over the weekend, citing the security situation. ‘It’s important we reflect the nation back to itself’ Host Patricia Karvelas asks the ABC’s managing director how lived experience should be incorporated in journalism? David Anderson said there were “a few absolutes”, including the legislation the ABC operates within – stating that “impartiality and accuracy are absolutely paramount”. When it comes to people’s personal and lived experience in storytelling, it’s important that we reflect the nation back to itself. It’s important that we – in who we are and what we do – that we [are] a good cross section of the population. So what we intend to do is sort of better clarify when people can bring in their personal, lived experience that doesn’t impede their obligations with regard to impartiality. Anderson said there are good examples of this over time, and there are “some not great examples of where this has attempted to happen, and we failed and failed around editorial standards.” So this is why we accept that we can clarify this. We could do that better to provide better guidance for people. And I have to say, internally, the ABC people are asking for it. ABC managing director says he reached out to Stan Grant ahead of racism review’s release The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, spoke with ABC RN this morning after the release of the independent racism review yesterday. Asked if the review was triggered by the resignation of prominent First Nations journalist Stan Grant, Anderson said it was a “combination of things” but “that was certainly one of them”. Anderson said he has reached out to Grant, and said: I don’t want to focus on that too much. I think that I’ve got a great deal of respect for Stan. I simply told Stan, this was coming. What I’m looking to do through media I’ve done yesterday and today is really focus on the report itself, on the findings of that report, the 120 people that gave their testimony to this, that described the racism that they have experienced … [and] concentrate on those recommendations. Here’s a look at the national weather forecast across Australia’s capital cities today, thanks to the Bureau of Meteorology: Anthony Albanese says that the Australian government condemns Iran’s missile attack on Israel. In a post to X, the prime minister wrote: This is an extremely dangerous escalation – Australia and the global community have been clear in our calls for de-escalation. Further hostilities put civilians at risk. We are monitoring the situation closely and encourage Australians in Israel to follow the advice of local authorities. One in three Australians throwing unwanted clothes in rubbish, survey finds Most Australians are confused about what to do with their unwanted clothes, leading about a third to throw their closet clutter in the rubbish, according to the first national survey of clothing use and disposal habits. The RMIT-led survey of 3,080 Australians found 84% of people owned garments they hadn’t worn in the past year, including a third who hadn’t touched more than half of their wardrobe. The survey’s lead author, Dr Alice Payne, said the results revealed consumers were confused about how to responsibly discard clothing. Continue reading below: Shadow foreign minister on Iranian attacks on Israel The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, has issued the following statement on social media following the Iranian attacks on Israel overnight: Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism, including Hamas, Hezbollah [and] Houthis, has inflicted great suffering on many. We condemn Iran’s attacks on Israel via proxy [and] their direct strikes. Australia must support Israel’s right to self defence, including the removal of such threats. Government secures more seats for Australians to leave Lebanon on Thursday The foreign minister, Penny Wong, said the government is working to help Australians who want to leave Lebanon, “including with partners such as Canada and the UK.” She said a number of Australians were assisted onto commercial flights on Monday and overnight, and additional seats have been secured for flights on Thursday. We are working to access more flights over coming days. DFAT is contacting registered Australians with updates. Australians in Lebanon who wish to leave should ensure they are registered via DFAT’s crisis portal. Three Russians from the cybercrime group Evil Corp have been slapped with fresh sanctions and travel bans by the federal government, AAP reports. The senior officials from the group, which has carried out ransomware attacks across the United States and Europe, will be banned from entering Australia under the penalties. The sanctions on Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets, Igor Olegovich Turashev and Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov will make it an offence for people to provide or deal with assets belonging to the Russians. The Russian cyber criminal gang have been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars around the world in hacking efforts. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the sanctions would help to deter other cyber attacks: These sanctions are only possible because of the efforts of our domestic and international partner agencies who work tirelessly to disrupt cybercriminals and protect Australians from ransomware. Murray Watt was also asked about the move from NSW police to try to stop a pro-Palestine protest planned for 7 October, and whether he thinks this is appropriate. The employment minister said protest permits are “always going to be a matter for state governments and state police”. But what I can make clear is that we don’t think it’s acceptable for anyone to celebrate the October 7 terrorist attack, whether that be on seventh of October in a few days time or any other date. It was an appalling terrorist incident cost many lives… the worst loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust. I don’t think that’s a cause for anyone to celebrate. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, yesterday said protesters are intending to “defending our right to protest and are determined to continue standing for justice for Palestine and Lebanon.” Asked if the Australian government wants Israel to temper its response to the Iranian attack overnight, Murray Watt said: “We want to see hostilities end from all sides of this conflict.” International law applies to all countries. There’s no doubting whatsoever that Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation and it needs to be dealt with, as does Hamas. That’s been something that our ministers and our government have been saying for some time. But we don’t want to see Lebanese or Israeli civilians continue to pay the price of this conflict… Watt was again asked if Australian believes Israel should “now hold back”, and responded that a ceasefire is the preference. And that does involve all parties de-escalating rather than continuing to ramp up the hostilities. We support Israel and the entire region’s security … but we need to end this dangerous cycle of violence, and that requires all parties to negotiate, to cease hostilities and to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. Australia ‘very willing to play our part’ in deescalating Middle East conflict, Watt says Murray Watt said the Australian government wants to see the “immediate de-escalation of the conflict in and around Lebanon” and for this to be “resolved diplomatically”. We have already seen far too many civilians killed in the conflict around Gaza. We’re deeply concerned about the risk of more civilian deaths in and around Lebanon, and this needs an effort from the international community to bring this to an end, to have an immediate ceasefire, and Australia is very willing to play our part in getting to that point. Patricia Karvelas asked if Israel has a right to respond to the attack overnight? Watt said “we certainly acknowledge that there have been hostilities inflicted on Israel for some time now”, and continued: This is this is a situation [where] we want to work with Israel and neighbouring countries to bring to an end – It’s not in anyone’s interest, whether it be Israel or its neighbouring countries, for this conflict to go on, to continue to see civilian deaths on both sides of the border, and we’re determined to work with the international community to bring that to an end. The Labor minister Murray Watt has been speaking to ABC RN about the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Host Patricia Karvelas says Australia is calling for a ceasefire but the US has been providing Israel support – and asks where the Australian government stands. Watt says he “wouldn’t put it that way”. This is obviously an extremely dangerous escalation that we’ve seen overnight, and Australia unreservedly condemns Iran’s actions in what it’s done overnight. But I think what we’ve seen in recent days is that not just Australia, but the global community generally, has been very clear in our calls for de-escalation in the region. You would have seen a few days ago, 21 countries from around the world – including Australia, the US, the UK, the EU and a number of other countries – called for an immediate ceasefire in and around Lebanon. So our position, I think, is actually consistent with those of like-minded countries in many parts of the world. Heatwave continuing in Top End of NT In more weather news, the heatwave is continuing in the Top End, with hot days and warm, humid nights. Heat in the Daly district peaked yesterday and is expected to peak again today, reaching extreme heatwave conditions. The heatwave is expected to continue through the weekend. Severe weather warning for south-west WA A severe weather warning has been issued for large parts of south-west Western Australia. Damaging wind gusts up to 100km/h are forecast as a cold front moves through, and locally destructive gusts up to 125km/h are possible about the coast later this evening. Australian Jewry chief says planned 7 October rallies are ‘callous’ and ‘shameful’ Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, has spoken with ABC News Breakfast after the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. He was asked about planned protests on 6 and 7 October this weekend (7 October is a public holiday in NSW), and whether people be able to peacefully rally and hold vigils to mark the anniversary? Ryvchin said “we have never opposed the right of anyone to gather peacefully” but “we’re talking about October 7”. So for the pro-Palestinian people to want to gather on that day, which is about a week before Israel’s response even began, it is callous, it’s heartless and it’s shameful. And I ask these people – show some concern for peace-loving Australians who just want to gather on October 7 and mourn and remember those who were needlessly massacred. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, said yesterday: “We intend on defending our right to protest and are determined to continue standing for justice for Palestine and Lebanon.” About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the pre-war population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. The origins of a human bone located at a Western Australian beach is being investigated by police. A member of the public located the bone at Cottesloe Beach in Perth on Saturday. It has since undergone assessment by a pathologist who determined it to be human. Western Australia police said in a statement that further forensic testing will take place to “match the bone to any outstanding missing persons”. The children’s commissioner said that when it comes to the role of the media in this issue, what she has observed is “a lack of interest in the solutions to the problem”. Anne Hollonds told ABC RN: There’s a lot of reporting of apparent youth crime, you know, lots of headlines like ‘teenage dirt bags’ and ‘kindergarten crims’. We know crime sells… But there’s not a lot of digging in and asking, ‘well, why are these children offending, and what can we do to prevent that?’ … The media, in just reporting it again and again, in showing all the footage that we get from CCTV and dashcam and body cam and iPhones now, that’s kind of creating more and more fear – which really is just escalating the pressure on the politicians to be tough. Many police and frontline staff aren’t trained to care for children, Hollonds says Anne Hollonds was asked about her proposal to build a capable and child-specialised workforce – and how this could happen amid broader workforce issues? She said it was the “failures of support and training” for frontline personnel that “came up again and again” in submissions and roundtables and interviews while compiling the report. We see it in the police watch houses, for example … Those police have no training to care for any children, let alone children with serious disabilities and mental health issues, and who are traumatised. So it’s not fair on those frontline staff, by the way – it’s not fair on them to put them in those positions, but mostly I’m worried about the children, because it’s not fair on them. We can’t expect them to get the care they need if we don’t support the staff. Q: Is there any appetite from the federal government to coordinate such an approach with the states to youth justice? Anne Hollonds said “so far, I haven’t had that indication”, but she has had indication from the state’s they would be willing to work together on this: I am hoping that we may have reached a tipping point whereby the horrendous failures in these systems that we’ve seen – such as the two tragic suicides of children in youth detention recently, within less than a year, and other horrific stories – I’m hoping that there is an appetite for thinking ‘well, we need to take a different approach’. We need to pivot towards the solutions that will focus on addressing the underlying causes, because just locking up these children is not a winning strategy at all for anybody. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Children’s commissioner to address National Press Club today on youth justice The children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, is due to address the National Press Club today on a new report calling for an overhaul of Australia’s approach to child justice. The report has been developed over 12 months and contains 24 recommendations, focusing on elevating child wellbeing to a national priority, coordinating action on child justice reform across Australia’s federation, and ensuring reform is based on evidence and human rights. She spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning ahead of the speech, and was asked about a campaign slogan from the Queensland opposition – “adult crime, adult time” – at the centre of the Liberal National party’s youth justice campaign. Is her approach at the polar opposite of that? Hollonds responded: That kind of slogan really is trying to show that ‘we’re really tough up here, we’re going to be tough on crime’. And what our report shows is that that approach, that traditional approach in this country, hasn’t worked and and that basically it’s evident that we’ve misunderstood the nature of the problem we’re trying to solve. We know that toughening up the justice system doesn’t actually prevent crime by children. Hollonds argued there is currently “no accountability and no national coordination” on how the wellbeing of children is looked after in the country. The idea that the states and territories could fix this on their own has been misguided, we need to work together on it. ‘Absolutely shocking allegations there’: O’Neil on ABC racism review Claire O’Neil was also asked about a report commissioned and released by the ABC, which spoke to 120 current and former staff – and all but one said they had personally experienced racism at the national broadcaster. The ABC’s managing director, David Anderson, has apologised to ABC staff who experienced racism at the public broadcaster: O’Neil told Sunrise: I was really surprised by this. I was really surprised. We have really high standards for our national broadcaster and that is appropriate … [The ABC] is meant to represent all Australians and to hear this I was genuinely shocked. I am glad that they have made this report public and the CEO has made that public [apology] to all staff. Some of those things in that report was horrendous reading and not much fun for people at the end of that conduct. Great that it is public, but absolutely shocking allegations there. Hume asked about planned pro-Palestine protests As Mostafa Rachwani reported yesterday, the organisers behind the weekly pro-Palestine protests have criticised New South Wales police for their decision to apply to the state’s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, said the group “unequivocally opposes this attempt to silence protests” and that the application was an “attack on fundamental democratic rights”. The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, was also up on Sunrise this morning and commented on those protests planned for the weekend: My biggest concern for Monday for protest – that is a very important day for many people in Australia, particularly the Jewish community who will be acknowledging the anniversary of the largest loss of Jewish people… We would expect police will be doing everything that they can to make sure that their [is] peace on our streets… The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, spoke with Sunrise just earlier about the Iranian missile attack on Israel – which she described as a “hugely concerning development” that the Australian government “utterly condemn[s]”. Asked how many Australians were still in the region, O’Neil said: There [are] roughly 15,000 [Australian’s] still in Lebanon and the Australian government is doing what it can to assist those people. Clearly to those people in Lebanon it is not a safe place for you to be. Please get on commercial flights if you have those openings available. O’Neil said there was a flight last night organised by the government to support Australians leaving the region, and there would be another one tonight. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I’ll be with you for most of the day, as we bring you our rolling coverage this Wednesday. As always, you can get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or email, emily.wind@theguardian.com, with any tips or thoughts. Let’s get started. Users still frustrated despite falling telco complaints Complaints about telcos are slowly falling, but fed-up customers still deserve better service and faster fixes, the industry watchdog says. As AAP reports, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reported a near-15% drop in complaints in 2023/24 compared to the previous year, with more issues needing escalation settled in a timely manner. Power players Telstra and Optus accounted for around two-thirds of all complaints, although Optus recorded the largest decrease of any of the 10 biggest providers. Optus’s decline in complaints came despite its monstrous service outage in November 2023 that affected around 10 million people, with customers seeking remedies ranging from reconnection to a personal apology. Ombudsman Cynthia Gebert said the nature of the complaints still being received showed an unsatisfied customer base that should expect better. A provider either delaying or failing to take action featured in 63% of all complaints, while disputes about service and equipment fees were involved in one-third. Gebert: The data shows consumers remain frustrated by the same issues: poor customer service, delays in fixing problems, and service and equipment fees. Can (and should) authorities take action against protesters who wave the Hezbollah flag? Peter Dutton wants parliament urgently recalled to debate new anti-terror laws in the light of the Hezbollah flag-waving controversy at the weekend. But is he fanning the flames of division as Labor says? Get up to speed with our explainer: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is suing Coles and Woolworths over allegations they misled shoppers by offering “illusory” discounts on hundreds of products. It’s a practice that helps them make huge profits in an already overheated economy. Guardian Australia columnist Greg Jericho tells Matilda Boseley why he thinks corporations, not consumers, should be made to pay for the cost-of-living crisis. Stronger consumer spending should not be an excuse for the Reserve Bank to potentially lift interest rates ahead of Christmas, retail bodies have warned. AAP reports that Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra said the Reserve Bank needs to offer a rate cut when it meets to discuss interest rates on 5 November. Whilst there is great resilience within retail, we know there are many businesses in the sector that are doing it tough, especially small businesses. This remains one of retail’s most difficult years – with a continued slowdown in discretionary spend, high business costs along with ongoing challenges. Retail trade figures for August revealed a 0.7% increase for the month and 3.1% for the year, with warmer weather driving discretionary spending on outdoor items as well as dining out. The spike followed a sluggish 0.1% rise in July. The National Retail Association interim chief executive, Lindsay Carroll, said while August’s figures were trending in the right direction, the retail sector was still struggling. The industry is at the mercy of consumer sentiment, that’s just the nature of retail. Business owners need every win they can get in the lead-up to Christmas. We are asking our policymakers to give retailers some breathing room to recover during this year’s holiday sale season. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be running through the top overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the reins. The organisers behind weekly pro-Palestine protests in Sydney have criticised NSW police for their decision to apply to the state’s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead this weekend. The Palestine Action Group has submitted the required paperwork for rallies on Sunday and Monday (a public holiday in NSW). But the police say they will seek to ban the marches to preserve public safety. The Albanese government made a last-minute rejection to proposed questions on sexuality and gender diversity in the upcoming 2026 census, sending bureaucrats into a weekend scramble, new documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information show. Late on Friday 23 August and into the next day officials at the Australian Bureau of Statistics agreed to cancel a scheduled media briefing on Monday 26 August and the rollout of its “large-scale” test census to 50,000 households from Tuesday 27 August as a result of the 11th-hour decision. The retailers’ peak body has pleaded today with the Reserve Bank not to raise rates before Christmas – and consider lowering them instead – despite stronger-than-expected consumer spending. We have more coming up on this, plus why supermarket superprofits could be fuelling inflation."

          "headline": "New state-owned energy retailer will put ‘people before profits’, Steven Miles says",
          "bodyText": "Seventeen years after a Queensland Labor premier sold off the state’s energy retailer, the party has conceded privatisation failed consumers and promised a new publicly owned “people’s” energy provider to power cheaper electricity bills. Incumbent Steven Miles announced the policy of a new state energy retailer on social media on the second day of the election campaign on Tuesday, before fronting the travelling press pack in Mackay with further details later on Wednesday morning. “The people’s provider will ensure households and businesses reap the benefits of that – not foreign shareholders,” Miles posted across his social media platforms. “We know how important it is to make energy bills cheaper for Queenslanders. “It’s simple – people before profits.” The premier told reporters that the proposed new retailer would deliver the option of a publicly owned electricity retailer in the south-east, where households and businesses have only been able to choose privately owned operators since the then premier Peter Beattie sold off the retail arm of Energex in 2007. Across the vast swathes of the state classed as regional Queensland – which includes major cities from Toowoomba to Cairns – it would see the new retailer compete against the existing state-owned Ergon, which is both distributor and retailer. This would lift monopoly restrictions placed on Ergon by the regulator and introduce competition in the retail market across the rest of the state. “We know more competition equals lower prices,” Miles said. “And we know that publicly owned government corporations can compete against each other to deliver that competition.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the new retailer would run as a subsidiary of Energy Queensland, limiting the set-up cost to about $1.4m and timeframe to about 12 months. It could save households up to 6% on their energy bills, he said – the regulated profit margin private retailers are allowed to bank. The LNP opposition leader, David Crisafulli, who has sought to neutralise some Labor policies such as cheap public transport fares by adopting them – derided the plan as “a desperate thought bubble”. “The solution is state-owned generators running at capacity, not more state-owned retailers running off with your money,” he said. Crisafulli said “10 years of bad planning” has meant Queenslanders “are paying more” for their electricity. Speaking in Rockhampton, Crisafulli reiterated that he would repeal the state’s legislated renewables target if elected, rejecting claims from the state’s environmental peak body that he could not meet the state’s emissions target without renewables. “There is a number of ways a government can deal by working with the private sector and indeed looking at its own back yard to reduce your emissions,” he said. Energy is the leading emitter in Queensland, representing 36% of the inventory. The business lobby also attacked Labor’s proposal, with the Business Chamber Queensland CEO, Heidi Cooper, claiming the “interventionist policy” would do little to put downward pressure on energy prices, but instead create another layer of bureaucracy and reduce competition. “Another state-owned body is anti-competitive, inefficient and interferes in the free market,” she said in a statement. But Dick said that time had revealed a “lack of success” in retail competition, particularly in the privately run south-east, since the public sell-off. “I don’t think we have seen the gains and the benefits to consumers from retail competition and energy prices that people anticipated,” he said. “It just hasn’t materialised.” Paul Williams, an associate professor of politics at Griffith University, said Queenslanders had long embraced publicly owned assets and that privatisation had proved “deeply unpopular”. “Can people honestly say that Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, for example, do they feel they get better service now than they did in the 1980s?” he said. “I think the overwhelming answer would be, no they don’t, they don’t feel they get better value for money.” He said many of these sell-offs had been driven by economic rationalist policy advisers, with the public given little say in the matter. “Is this a turning of the tide?” he said. “It may well be.” But though it might prove a popular idea, a model for others to copy and a “barbecue stopper”, it was unlikely to change the result of an election widely tipped to go to the LNP in a landslide, he said. The Greens energy spokesperson, Michael Berkman, said it was “great to see Miles unpicking some of the disastrous privatisation of his Labor predecessors” but called for 100% public ownership. The University of Queensland economics professor John Quiggin said that this announcement could be “laying the groundwork” for just that outcome, saying “a return for a fully publicly owned system … is what I think we should ultimately aim for”. “The only part of the industry that was fully privatised is retail,” he said. “This is an acknowledgment that privatisation is a failed policy.”"

          "headline": "Ross Raisin’s Ghost Kitchen wins 2024 BBC national short story award with dark gig economy tale – read it here",
          "bodyText": "British novelist Ross Raisin has won the 2024 BBC national short story award for Ghost Kitchen, a story narrated by a bicycle courier and inspired by the gig economy. Raisin was announced as the winner of the £15,000 prize, which is run in collaboration with Cambridge University, on Tuesday evening. “I feel very happy,” said Raisin shortly after finding out that he had won. “I’ve had a bit of a struggle for quite a while with wondering whether writing is still a viable thing for me to continue doing as a living. This moment really does give me fuel. Financial fuel, for sure, but more importantly, creative fuel”. Ghost Kitchen follows Sean, a young man who becomes a courier after a tragic family incident. Raisin said he became interested in the growth of ghost kitchens – food businesses that exclusively serve customers by delivery or pick-up, with no dine-in space – while writing his last novel, A Hunger, which was published in 2022. Ghost kitchens, or dark kitchens, are “so-called in part because they have no windows, no way for anybody on the outside to see in”; they are “often on the outskirts of urban areas”, “concealed islands that sometimes create the conditions for darkness to flourish,” said Raisin. He had also been thinking about food delivery models and having some “fascinating conversations” with couriers, which “led naturally to a deeper level of critical and creative thinking about the gig economy”. Some background knowledge for the story came from “years of working either in kitchens or around kitchens, in hotels and bars and restaurants,” Raisin said. New details came from talking to food service workers. “The guy ends up working in a fish and chip kitchen, and so I had to understand how deep fat fryers work.” “I had a lovely afternoon going with my daughter to the B&amp;Q car park on the Hull Road in York, which has a chip van in it” serving “the best chips that I know of in York.” He asked the man running it: “Tell me everything about that deep fat fryer – how it works, and what the temperature should be, and how do you clean it at the end of the night, and what do you do with your spent oil?” Ghost Kitchen was a “standout story from the beginning,” said novelist and prize judge Jenn Ashworth. “We loved the delicacy of the prose, the pitch perfect handling of memory and backstory.” Raisin was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, and now lives in York. He has written four novels and is the author of the creative writing guide Read This If You Want to Be a Great Writer, published in 2018. In 2013, he was named on Granta’s once-a-decade Best of young British novelists list. He said that he has begun developing a novel which “takes the same world and characters and themes” as Ghost Kitchen but explores new topics related to the gig economy and “different kinds of violence – physical violence, corporate violence – and also the justice system, the asylum system”. Raisin was shortlisted alongside finance lawyer Manish Chauhan and novelists Will Boast, Vee Walker and Lucy Caldwell, who won the prize in 2021. The shortlisted authors receive £600 each. Their stories are available to listen to on BBC Sounds and are also featured in an anthology published by Comma Press. Alongside Ashworth on this year’s judging panel were writers Michael Donkor and Xiaolu Guo, BBC Audio’s books editor Di Speirs, and chair of judges, presenter Paddy O’Connell. “I am absolutely delighted that Ross Raisin, a writer whose novels have stopped me in my tracks and made me see afresh, has turned his undoubted talent to the short story, and with similarly powerful effect,” said Speirs. “A brilliantly rendered glimpse into life in the edge-lands, Ghost Kitchen combines the tension of a dark plot with an unexpected and moving exploration of male friendship.” Previous winners of the award include Jonathan Buckley, Sarah Hall and Saba Sams. In 2023, Naomi Wood won the prize for her story Comorbidities, a story about a couple who decide to make a sex tape. Also announced was the winner of the BBC young writer’s award, open to 14- to 18-year-olds, which went to Lulu Frisson, a 17-year-old sixth former from Birmingham. Her story, Special, is about a neurodiverse student who is struggling at school until an empathic teacher encourages her creativity. *** Ghost Kitchen by Ross Raisin Already, he had mastered these streets. He knew the cuts through the alleyways and service areas; where there would be vehicles parked over the cycle lanes; which lights could be run. He had also, finally, mastered the bike – which had been Frank’s and was, in truth, a piece of shit – and as he rode now onto Museum Street, past the theatre, the memorial park, the old boy playing his penny whistle outside the library, he knew to downshift softly, before the bike got wind of the climb ahead, letting the gears decide for themselves when to catch. At the crest of the hill – the momentary view over yellow fields beyond the city – Sean pushed on, down towards the outskirts. He was two minutes behind. He moved into the middle of the lane and pedalled harder, nervous energy coursing through him, until at the end of the street he was forced to stop. Commuter traffic crawled thickly across the junction in front of him. For a whole minute he waited, watching the slow procession of drivers alone in their cars – before the release of the light when he could slice through the congestion, out onto the other side of the ring road. The roads were at once quieter here. Sean rode quickly, feeling the new strength in his legs. The dark was coming on but he left his lights in his jacket pocket, not wanting to stop and lose more time attaching them, or to make himself more visible. There was nobody about, though. No figures in the shadows of the buildings, no police, yet he remained watchful, checking around him at every turning, the entrance to every enclosed street. The dyke was close to here. He could turn to look down the passageway where part of it would be visible, but he resisted the impulse. He glanced at the wristwatch on his handlebar. He’d gained almost a minute. Still he kept up his pace, moving deeper into this untouched part of the city where blue, spiked metal fencing ran along the backs of industrial units – an electrical distributors, a meat wholesaler, a document shredding firm – and massive tangles of blackthorn and brambles grew undisturbed on the roadside scrubland. When he turned onto the final lane he twisted round to look behind him. Nobody. The roller shutters of the house clearance depot were down and the only sound anywhere was the clicking of the front wheel as he slowed, stealing around the side of the next warehouse building, and dismounted. However long he was made to wait, he was exactly on time. *** The door was open. Sean left the bike and walked up to it. Behind the grilles of the warehouse wall’s two thin, cracked windows, the glass was fogged with condensation. Sean paused briefly, just outside the entrance, then went inside. Syrupy heat immediately enveloped him. He could see all the way down the gangway. A snarled mass of cables, dangling wires, hung down through the cloud above it. Below, the hands and arms of men, silent as ghouls, were moving in the brightly-lit mist of each pod. Even now, a couple of months since he had first come to this place, Sean was amazed by the smell. The smell was wild. Pungent. Weird. On that first night, he had walked down the gangway looking into each pod in turn, mesmerised by the stink and lights, the men with their quick hands, working without speaking inside their small caverns, until a man had appeared and told him to get back to the collection area. An order was on one of the collection shelves, the paper bag stapled and ready. Sean checked the code on his phone against the one on the wall screen. It was his. Outside, a car was pulling up, its engine just perceptible underneath the churning of the ventilation fans. He took off his bag and put the order inside – stooping to take in the smell of it through the mingled fumes of beefburgers and shawarma and Vietnamese food. He lingered for a few seconds before zipping the bag shut. Fish and chips. A smell that reminded him of childhood, of Frank; reminded him too that he had not eaten before coming out to work. He registered the collection and studied quickly the route that came up on his phone. He was about to set off when a movement in one pod, Unit 3, caught his eye. He stepped to the opening of the gangway, from where he could spy in. A tall, thick-set man, foreign, it seemed to Sean through the mist, stood with his back against one of the line of deep-fat fryers. A shorter man was standing in front of him, their faces close together. The short man laughed, pointing to the floor – and the tall man, bending down, went out of Sean’s view, then stood up again. He held out a pair of tongs, which the short man took from him. Laughing again, and speaking to somebody out of Sean’s sight, he raised the tongs towards the tall man’s face and arranged the pincers around him, first from cheek to cheek, then from his chin to the top of his forehead, as if measuring his head. Sean could feel a familiar trickle of fear entering his blood. Suddenly, the short man threw the tongs to the floor, again the other man bent to retrieve them. There was a sound behind him – the man from the car coming into the building. Sean stepped back from the opening, put his bag onto his back, and went outside. He got on the bike and raced into the growing dark – security lights, mounted beneath the barbed wire coiled along the warehouse roof, firing on him, one by one, like search beams. In the shower, he let out a long moan of exhaustion. He knew that he should massage his legs, or at least stretch them out, but he was too tired to bother. And the aching in his thighs, his calves, felt good, a kind of release; it felt, as the water slid down the expanding muscular shapes of his legs, like somebody else’s body. He towelled himself dry and left the bathroom with the towel wrapped around him, crossing the corridor into his room. For a moment, the incident at the warehouse played again in his mind – he was too tired, though, to think about that, and it was nothing to do with him. He was doing okay. This was what he needed now. He could do as many, or as few, deliveries as he wanted. There was nobody to tell him otherwise; there was nobody to tell him anything at all. He could go whole days without having to see or speak to anybody, other than a fleeting transaction on a doorstep. He had become invisible. He picked his jeans up from the floor and fished out the night’s surprising, pathetic, tip from his pocket, to put into the Tupperware on his window sill. Then he collapsed, naked and already almost asleep, onto the bed. *** Long brown puddles had begun to form at the road edges. He was mostly able to steer around them, until a cabbie or a van driver, speeding past, pinned him to the kerb. The rain had been coming down heavily all afternoon. His skin burned under his sodden jeans but he did not care – he barely took any notice of the downpour as he rode and arrived at each office reception, each student house, or waited inside the steaming entrances of chain restaurants. The rain was good. The rain meant more deliveries, higher fees, because most riders turned the work down. Sometimes, when Sean did see another rider gliding by on the opposite side of the road, a necklace of water arcing from their rear wheel, he wondered at the strength of their need to come out into it, to be doing this too. The flat’s button was the first of three grubby, peeling labels on the entry system. Rain drummed on the top of his bag while he waited on the doorstep. He pressed the button again. When it opened, a boy looked at him and laughed. “Hey, man – you look wet.” Sean took the pizzas out of the bag and handed them to him. “Thanks.” The boy lifted the stack of boxes up to his face, inspecting for damp. “Nice one.” He turned to go back inside – “See you later!” – and closed the door. The good thing about students: there was no awkward moment of pause when they didn’t tip you. For a little while longer, rain tickling the skin of his back, Sean stayed on the doorstep. The boy’s face, laughing. He was at least five years younger than Frank would be now, but something about his eyes, the mischief in them. A new request was pinging on his phone. He shielded the rain from the screen with his hand and saw, below the request, a message notification from earlier: Alright mate, how’s things? None of us have... He swiped to clear it, and pressed on the order request. £5.42. The Harbour Fisheries. Unit 3. He accepted, and got back onto his bike. He crossed over the ring road and into the industrial zone, where the hard metallic sound of rain on the warehouse roofs was all around him. At the top of the passageway to the dyke, he paused, looking down it to the wall above the water. Then he forced himself once again to move, and pressed on. He arrived at the warehouse two minutes late, but the order was not ready. He stepped through the collection area and looked into the pod. Four men were at four fryers, all of them working at speed – shaking baskets of chips, lifting golden bars of fish from the hot oil – the backs of their necks slick with sweat. The tall man from last night was putting a completed meal box into a paper bag, then carrying it into the service corridor, vanishing momentarily, before coming back into view behind the shelves of the collection area. When Sean moved forward towards the order, he was already on his way back to the pod. “Want to earn some more?’” A man with a big, moist beard and white, rubber boots had appeared, like a real fisherman, in the gangway entrance. Sean steadied himself, packing the order correctly into his bag. “What do you mean?” “Two of my staff fucked off this week, no warning for me, and tonight is last Friday of the month – busy, busy – so if you want that to be your last delivery today, job is yours.” He was watching Sean put the bag over his shoulders. “We pay better than them.” Sean gazed through the collection shelves to where the tall man had just been. He thought about all the hours he had ridden since signing to the app, to gain tonight’s priority-access shift; a part of him, however, had already decided. “It will be worth it for you.” The man looked down at the pool of water on the floor around Sean. “And it is more dry in here.” *** The rain had eased off by the time he returned. The short man from last night, who, from his clothing, Sean now took to be the site manager, was smoking outside the building. When Sean went inside and looked down the gangway trench into the Unit 3 pod, only the tall man and one other worker were stood at the fryers. The man with the beard was approaching through the service corridor, into the space behind the collection shelves. “Good.” He lifted the metal counter flap to let Sean through. “Mehmet,” he said, clapping himself on the chest. “Follow me.” Mehmet led him into a windowless breeze-block room behind the pods. Towers of meal boxes, differently branded for each of the four pods, were lined against one wall. Further down the room, where it ran behind the other pods, Sean could see a large, clear bag full of burger buns, plump and squished like faces against the plastic. Mehmet beckoned him to the far corner, where it was darker, away from the light of the bare bulb above the door. “Here.” Mehmet handed him a navy apron. “I will put you next to Zac. He can show you, but you can start with just chips. Should be easy now. No rain, less orders.” Inside the pod, Mehmet spoke briefly to a young man with short, stiff blond hair, Zac, while Sean waited by the storeroom. The tall man was close to him, at the far end of the line. He was working quickly, extracting fish from the fryer with one hand at the same time as spooning mushy peas into a frilled paper pot with his other. Zac turned to face him. “Okay, then.” He pointed at the fryer next to his own. “Mr Chips.” Zac showed him the correct amount of chips to get onto the shovel, how to mount and detach the basket, how to submerge it without splashing oil. “Cooked chips go in that tray. Keep them coming for now. I’ll tell you when you can slow down.” ‘How do I know when they’re cooked?’ ‘Ever eaten chips before?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Then you’ll know.’ For the next five or ten or twenty minutes he fell into the timeless dulled rhythm of the work, plunging the basket, again and again, watching the bubble and pop of tiny exhalations that rose to the surface of the black pond of fat. A low hum of unbroken labour was all around him: the shuffle of feet, the soft fizz of frying food, the drone of the extraction fan. Zac, he noticed, sometimes spoke quietly to himself while he worked, as if he was inside a dream. Once, a bang and a muffled shout came through the wall from the next pod – within touching distance, but as separate as another universe. Sean had forgotten to eat again, and his stomach reeled as he processed the baskets and baskets of chips. He saw with alarm that the short man was looking at him from the gangway. Sean focused on another shovel of pale, frozen chips, his skin tightening as he heard the man laugh. But when he peeked up, he realized with relief that the man was in fact looking past him – to the end of the line where Mehmet was standing directly behind the tall man. One of the frilly paper pots was balanced, upside-down on his head, like a miniature hat. Sean tried to ignore the frightened quickening of his blood when the short man came past behind him. He was laughing again, and when Sean turned to look, Mehmet was positioning another pot behind the first one. The man carried on at his tasks with the pots on his head, like it was a party game, and then Mehmet put down a third to make a line, a mohican of pots down the centre of his skull. “Look, Dougie,” Mehmet said to the short man, who was bent over with laughter, his hands on his knees. “That’s how big their heads are!” Next to Sean, between him and the tall man, Zac was staring at the fish floating in front of him. Sean plunged another basket, his eyes following the flotsam of lost, blackened chips drifting against the scummy fatline of the metal, not allowing himself to look up again until the basket was done. A pyramid of pots was now stacked on the man’s head. Mehmet stood with his arms folded, admiring his work, Dougie at his side losing his shit as Mehmet stepped forward, puckering his lips, to blow the pots off the man’s head. They fell to the floor – except for one, which dropped into the boiling liquid of the man’s fryer. For an instant, Sean was sure that he saw anger flicker in the man’s face, and excitement rushed through him in anticipation of the man retaliating. Whatever instinct of reprisal had come into the man, however, he swiftly restrained. Sean watched him – Zac was openly watching now too – use his tongs to carefully pluck out the pot, brown and crumpled, from the fryer and put it into the bin by his knees, while Mehmet and Dougie walked away together into the storeroom. By the end of the night, Sean’s clothes had dried to a crust, and the continuous mizzle of oil had caused red patches to bloom up his right forearm. Mehmet came up to him while Zac was demonstrating how to drain and clean down his fryer. He told Sean that he could work the rest of the weekend if he wanted. “Then we see. Maybe you stay longer.” “Okay,” Sean said. When he looked down the line of fryers, the tall man had gone. *** Over the next two days, he fell into a new routine: delivering from late morning through the afternoon; then, after a quick sandwich which he had foiled and tucked into the bottom of his bag, riding to the warehouse to stand at the fryers, into the night. He was upgraded to fish. Zac told him the cooking times for the different ones, which Sean wrote onto the base of one of the meal boxes. The tall man was there, at his usual fryer at the end of the line, on both days. A mute agitation moved through Sean each time Mehmet or Dougie went near him, although nothing happened, that Sean could see. The man simply got on quickly and silently with his work, uninterrupted. As the weekend went on, time continued to stretch, to lose its shape. There were some occasional stiller moments; long periods, too, of intense heat and sweat. The orders never stopped coming in. Day and night. With every ping on his phone, and every new order appearing on the pod’s blinking screen, he gave himself over to the ceaseless current of demand, a digitized hunger that could never be satisfied. This new life, he told himself, was the right one for him now. He was his own man, on his own time, able to lose himself in work – and the pod, hidden from the city, from people, was a place where the rest of the world, and his family, and the past, no longer existed. Late on Sunday night, when he had drained the oil from his fryer and was shaving the black warts of congealed batter from the sides with a metal scraper, he heard Mehmet calling him from inside the storeroom. When he went inside, Mehmet was sitting in the corner on an upturned crate. Two of the others were there: a boy who had worked on Saturday, and the tall man. From an inside pocket of his denim jacket, Mehmet took out a handful of white envelopes, which he placed on top of the giant tub of curry sauce beside him. Both of the others moved forward slightly. ‘Queue,’ Mehmet said plainly. The tall man automatically moved behind Sean as the boy stepped in front of him. The boy, taking the envelope that Mehmet handed to him, mumbled thank you and left the room. “You are okay with cash,” Mehmet said, not looking up at Sean for a reply, instead opening one of the envelopes. He pulled out a twenty pound note from the small stash that was there, raising his face now, grinning, at the man behind Sean. “Oops.” He slid the note into a different envelope. “Must have counted wrong.” He held out the envelope with the extra twenty towards Sean. A compulsion to not take the envelope, to not leave the man alone in this room with Mehmet, rooted Sean where he was – Mehmet watching him, interested – until Sean felt it weaken, and leave him. Mehmet gave a short laugh. “There will be more next week. Now go on – fuck off. Same time tomorrow.” *** His legs were no longer his own. They ached all of the time, a discomfort that he became able, for the most part, to ignore. Some nights, when he left the warehouse, he stopped off at the petrol station on the ring road and bought two bags of ice. When he got back to his room he arranged a ragged stretch of tarpaulin, that he had found hanging in a bush, over his mattress and lay down with the bags of ice under his thighs. Whole days passed without sitting down – apart from on the saddle, or for the short pause between his two jobs when he would set himself up a little distance down the lane from the warehouse to eat his sandwich, in a gap between the bushes, perched on a tyre behind the fencing of a corrugated lock-up unit. At that time of day there was still some activity in the zone: the shapes of men behind the metal-meshed windows of the house clearance depot; vans leaving the security-fenced area. Mainly, though, it was riders. A stream of them, back and forth, each one inside their own cocoon of music and wind, all indifferent to the risk they might be taking, cycling into this industrial wilderness, the threat of violence. A couple of times, he got to the warehouse a few minutes early and joined Zac round the side of the building for a cigarette. Here, during the strange brief intimacy of leaning back together against the old mattress that had been propped on the wall by the smokers, he learned from Zac that the pods had been in operation for almost a year. Zac had been here almost since the beginning, after being tipped off by a friend. “Couldn’t believe it when I first saw. Like finding a drug factory in the middle of a forest.” He told Sean that Unit 3’s owners, men Sean had never seen, used to have two fish and chip shops in the city. “Went bust, didn’t they? Near as, anyway. So they got a unit out here when all the dark kitchen stuff started. All the expensive stuff gets paid for them, energy and rent and whatever, so all they’ve got to pay for is us, fish, and a shit ton of frozen chips. And the commission, obviously, which won’t be cheap – but as long as the orders are coming in, who’s complaining?” While he was saying this, the tall man became visible through the fencing and scrub, walking down the lane. “They’ve put me on the roll now, and fair enough – they’ve got to be careful, right? The only ones not on the roll, except for newbies like you, is the illegals.” He nodded to where the man was going out of sight past the corner of the building. “But they’ll hardly cost much. Far as anyone else is concerned, they don’t exist. Just ghosts.” *** Whether the orders were coming in hard or steady, the tall man always seemed to work at the same pace – his movements rapid and nimble, his station always immaculate. Sean had noticed, too, that he took more care than the others to assemble his meals, positioning the elements precisely – the fish, the pot of peas or curry sauce, the pointless wedge of lemon – instead of cramming it all in with a slump of chips like Zac and the other boy did. Most nights, he would be hassled at least once by Mehmet or Dougie: dropping his tongs to the floor; standing behind him to whisper in his ear, or flick it repeatedly. The hat game was clearly a favourite. Balancing as many of the pots on his head as they could, trying to break their record. How easy it was, to do nothing; to let it become normal. But every night, when Sean pedalled away down the lane and through the dark industrial shapes of the buildings, a rekindled feeling of guilt would cling to him, as he replayed each incident, and imagined all the ways that he could have stopped them. Thoughts which, by the time he got back to his bedsit with his party bags of ice, had always taken him back to the dyke. One afternoon, two weeks into the routine of his parallel jobs, Sean’s first collection was a Vietnamese order from Unit 1. When he went into the collection area, where his order was waiting for him on a shelf, he heard a shout coming through the gangway. He moved closer and could see Dougie in Unit 3, holding the tall man from behind, pinning his arms. Mehmet was in front of him, their noses almost touching, speaking into the man’s face while he poked him in the belly. Sean could hear his own breathing while he watched the man start to struggle. Dougie’s face and neck were red with the effort of detaining him, the man bigger, stronger than Dougie – and, with a cry, he pulled himself free. His fists were for a moment outstretched, either side of Mehmet’s head, and Sean was certain – the man shouting now in another language – that he was about to strike him. But Dougie slammed his knee into the man’s back and immediately he went limp, Dougie pinning his arms once more, and together he and Mehmet began dragging him backwards towards the storeroom. Sean cycled away, slowly at first, as if a bolder part of him might yet pull up, and go back. Soon, however, he was speeding faster and faster, the chain grinding beneath him. What, really, could he have done? There were two of them, both stronger than him. He fought back the nagging awareness of what Frank would have thought about it; what Frank, in his shoes, would have done. A sudden crunching sound came from below him, the chain wrenching free of the sprocket. The bike became unsteady, careening, and Sean tilted to one side with the abrupt weight of the bag on his back, until he was able to bring the bike to a halt. He paused briefly to regain his composure. Here in the quiet of the passageway behind the shredding firm, his breath was coming thickly again. He dismounted, and when he bent to attend to the chain a spasm of pain shot through his side. He fell to the ground, the bike landing clumsily on top of his body. There were voices – darting white faces above him – and new pain in his right knee, somebody kicking him. “Fuck’s sake, take it off him.” He was being pulled backwards across the tarmac – then forcefully sat upright, his chest echoing with the scrabble of hands that were groping at the bag on his back. Three boys, keyed up, wild. A new terror surged in him, making him attempt to turn his body so that he could see their faces – but he did not recognise them, he was sure; these were different boys. One of them knelt in front of him and straddled his legs. His face when he leant forward was so close that Sean could see a small rash through the hair above his ear, while he slipped the straps from Sean’s shoulders with a skill and delicacy that was like tenderness, and the others pressed down painfully on his ankles. “Got it. Let’s go!” Sean watched them run away down the passageway with the bag. Then he looked at Frank’s bike, still sprawled beside where he sat, too shit to steal. On the ground near him a line of paper scraps followed the contour of the building like a trail of confetti. The boys had stopped running and were opening the bag. The image of the man being dragged into the storeroom flashed in Sean’s mind; the thought seizing him that he had brought this attack on himself. “Taking the piss?” The voice of one of the boys reverberated between the buildings. He threw the bag to the ground and held out the stacked meal boxes towards the others. “It’s fucking Japanese.” *** Sean stayed in bed, awake, long into the morning. The pings were starting to come in – he had turned the app on out of habit – but he let them sound, even though he knew he was not going to deliver today. There was a pain above his hip, bruises on both of his ankles. He lay on his back, his thoughts hovering over him. Each new ping, interrupting the floating dream of yesterday, prompting him to get up. Frank – leaning over him, grinning and shaking his head – badgering him to get his arse out of bed. He got up and walked gingerly to the corner of the room. He was still in his clothes, so he just picked up the hoodie that was on the floor and slowly, carefully, put it on and went out. The rear derailleur mechanism was not right. He had threaded the chain back on yesterday but something was catching more than usual, newly kinked. He would need to get the bike serviced, or finally let it go. When he got to the petrol station, he locked it to the cycle stand by the cash dispenser. An old woman was filling up her little brown car at the pump closest to the shop. She stood in a square of sunshine, gripping the hilt of the fuel nozzle with both hands, her body braced with the physical effort of holding it there. Sean walked towards the entrance, watching her finish filling up, struggling then to pull out the nozzle. He hesitated, unsure whether it would be rude to offer his help, but with a final effort the woman slid it out – and for a moment she stood there, triumphant, the metal dripping in her hands, like a warrior. Sean went inside the shop. He moved straight to the flowers and gave no thought to which of the two varieties he would buy; he had paid and left the shop before the old woman had even reached the sliding doors of the entrance. With the flowers laid across his handlebars, attached by the wristwatch at one end and an elastic band at the other, the petals quivered as he rode. Numbness was beginning to spread through him: the slow drug of ritual moving up his spine, his neck, entering his brain. Only the twinge of his right knee, with every push down on the pedal, cut through. He was close now. The warehouses were spaced further apart here. Between some of them, sunlit clearings of abandoned ground had filled with long grasses, burrows, solitary poppies. Sean cycled on, constantly vigilant, until he came to the dyke. A worm of dirty water trickled below the far bank. The grass of the bank was bathed in sun – and Sean could already see them all there, laughing, drinking, their feet dangling over the water. He got off the bike and leant it up against the crumbling, graffitied wall that ran along the top of the near side, then walked along the wall to the spot. There was not much there: the remnants of some previous flowers, not his, and their tattered plastic sleeve. The document pouch on its rusty spike in the wall, a blue halo of ink diffused around each of the words on the letter. He slung the old flowers over the wall and put down the new ones. For a moment, he stood there. Then he stepped down the bank and jumped across the dyke, before climbing to the place where the bank creased into a grassy shelf, and he sat down. Behind him, beyond the wall on this side, there was the passing thunder of a train. He took off his shoes and socks and let the brown water swallow his toes, closing his eyes now to the memory of the other group arriving, the four of them stepping through the broken wall. Their catcalls coming across the dyke. Goading – playful, at first – but Frank and his friends bristling, a history with these other lads, and the first bit of brick striking the bank close to Frank’s hand, his friends getting to their feet, shouting, leaping the dyke to get to the boys. Sean could feel it strongly now: the intensity of his need for Frank not to join in, to stay there with him. The mangled sound that had left his throat, pleading for Frank to come back. He opened his eyes. A tiny bird was hopping about on the other side. It moved down to the water and took a drink. Sean watched the bird as it hopped back up the bank to the top, where the phantoms of young, male bodies were closing upon each other, straining with intent – one of the other group, his face dark with blood, being held back by his mate but breaking free and in an instant both groups charging towards each other in a chaos of motion – arms and fists and shouts and the hand, reaching down, to pick up the chunk of broken brick. Sean not able to see yet, in the speed of it all, whose body it was, dropping to the ground as everybody else scarpered. He kept to the middle of the streets, taking the longer routes around the warehouses instead of cutting through the alleys. But there was nobody about, the air dead except for the muted rumble of traffic girdling the city and the occasional noise of a train distantly behind him. When he turned onto the lane to the pods he slowed down and cycled towards the gap in the thick mess of bushes. He dismounted and walked his bike into the space, to lean against the metal fence that was exposed to the sunshine like a ribcage, and sat down on the tyre, to wait. Every few minutes a rider rushed past on the lane. They did not notice him, in his tucked away position. With each bright flash of colour, Sean had the strange sensation that he was watching himself: collecting, delivering, accelerating always towards the next order, the next order. Here, in this leafy bunker, everything else became heightened. The faraway hydraulic scoop and lift of a machine. The close, low laughter of a man behind the wall of the lock-up unit. As he listened to these things, his hand, as if separate from the goings-on of his brain, went to his pocket. He took out his phone and put his finger to one of the column of notifications, a voicemail – which, when he opened the list, brought up a uniform queue of attempts to speak to him. He put the phone to his ear and the voice of his mum was at once inside his head, as easy and familiar as if she was calling him in for tea. “...wondering how you’re getting on and if you need anything. We just wanted to let you know as well that we’re going to pay a visit, and we know you might not want to, but if you want to come with us then –” He stopped the message, but before the phone was back in his pocket his mind was already on the dyke. They did not know that he went there; they thought he had severed that from his life, that it was only them who kept the memory of what happened there. Through the fringe of foliage, Sean could see the tall man approaching. It struck Sean for the first time that he travelled in on foot, and he found himself curious about how far the man came in from; the same distance again walking back home into the dark later. Home. The thought of his parents – then the alien picture of his bedsit came into his head: a place that had become, through the press of time, a kind of home; or, at least, a refuge from it. The man was near enough that Sean could hear his boots on the lane. When he was a few metres away, Sean emerged from his hiding place. The man stopped still, staring at Sean, confused. “Got in a bit early,” Sean said. Then, when the man did not say anything: “I work where you do – Unit 3”. The man was looking at the tyre, the drift of rubbish against the fence. “Shall we walk in?” Sean asked. The man still said nothing, but waited for Sean to wheel his bike away from the fence, and they set off together towards the warehouse. Sean had not thought about what to say to him. When he did glance across at the man, he saw that he was older than Sean had presumed. There were small lines at the corner of his eye, a slim silver current running through his hair. When they were almost at the warehouse, Sean could see Zac reclining against the mattress, smoking alongside a couple of workers from the other pods. Zac was looking at them coming down the lane and Sean could feel his heart rate increasing, until Zac went out of view as they came to the front of the building. Sean pushed his bike to lock up in the shelter, while the man, without a word, went inside the building. The orders came in smoothly, a Tuesday night. Neither Mehmet nor Dougie were in and Sean felt himself relax into the flow of work. His hip ached, standing still, but he did not think about the attack, or about his visit to the dyke. At the fryer beside him, Zac was keeping to himself; there was only, every now and again, one of his daydream whispers audible above the fans and the roiling liquid. Further down the line, the tall man was focused as intently as always on his orders. Sean wondered what went through his mind as he worked; whether he was fearful of Mehmet and Dougie returning, or if he imagined, sometimes, what he might do in response to them. At the end of the shift, when they had drained and scraped and paper-towelled the fryers, swept and mopped, refrigerated the unused fish, the man was first to complete his clean-down tasks, and left straight away – giving, as he walked out, a single nod goodbye to Sean. *** The next day, Sean went back to riding. He accepted his first ping at midday – a large order of deli sandwiches to an assembly of mothers and babies in a park, which filled his bag so tightly that the zip would not properly do up – and he carried on riding all through the afternoon until he could arrange himself, fifteen minutes before the start of his kitchen shift, in the gap in the bushes. The man did not seem surprised this time. He stopped and waited as before for Sean to get his bike, then they walked off silently down the lane. When they arrived, Sean turned to the man before he went to lock up his bike. “Sean.” The man looked at him. “Ebdo.” Over the next couple of days, the short walk together became a routine. The same time each evening, the same nod hello and the quiet walk down the lane. On the Sunday evening, however, Ebdo was a few minutes late. An anxious thought quickly took hold of Sean that something had happened, or that he should not be doing this – until there the man was, walking up to him again, just as normal. Sean realized, wheeling out the bike to move away down the lane together, that his arms and legs were streaming with relief, and he wanted in that moment to know more about Ebdo; to talk to him. He wondered whether Ebdo thought it was strange, this ritual that Sean had begun. It was raining, very lightly – the mist of it so fine that Sean, still wearing his helmet, had barely noticed – but Ebdo’s hair was wet through, and Sean realised that he must walk in from some distance away. “Where do you come in from?” Sean asked. For a few seconds, Ebdo did not answer. Then, as Sean was thinking that he had not understood, he said, “Kurdistan”. “Oh,” Sean said. “Long walk, then.” Sean turned his head, at once worried that he had spoken out of turn, but Ebdo was smiling. “Yes,” he said, “believe me.” They were halfway to the warehouse and Sean felt a longing to keep talking like this, for the conversation not to be shut down as soon as they were amongst the others. “You’re good at the job, you know,” he said. “Really fast.” When Ebdo again did not respond, Sean added, “Much faster than me.” “But you have two jobs.” He gestured to Sean’s bag. “Right, yeah. Sucker for punishment.” Mehmet was in the entrance, watching them. When they got nearer, Sean could see his eyes moving between them both. “Come on,” he called, clapping his hands twice together as they came past the drums of spent oil. “Choppity fucking chop.” The orders started coming in immediately, before Sean had chance to get his station ready or even bring his oil to temperature. Some national event was happening in the real world, Sean remembered dimly – a match, or a TV competition – and a tension was in the air of the pod: Mehmet walking up and down behind their backs, clapping or shouting for them to go faster; the pink streak of Dougie in the gangway going between the pods. At one point, Mehmet leant in to speak a few words out of Sean’s earshot to the weekend boy, who was struggling to keep up at the fryer next to him. The boy nodded and went at his work with still more haste. *** It was about three hours into the shift, when the orders were progressively slowing down, that they started. They began in the usual way – the paper-pot hats – and Sean detected again the spark of almost-retaliation in Ebdo, but he carried on, transporting his final completed orders to the collection shelves with the pots on his head for all the couriers to see. A fierce heat of shame flared in Sean – and then anger, that Ebdo let them do this to him. Mehmet was standing against the wall opposite the fryers. In one hand, he held a plastic box of lemon wedges. He picked one out, holding it up level with his eye, like a darts player, then threw it. The wedge landed – with a spurt of oil – in Ebdo’s fryer. The next one dropped in just as Ebdo was tonging out the first and his hats at last tumbled from his head. A barrage of Mehmet’s lemons were now flying through the air, hitting the fryer, hitting Ebdo’s back, and a cord of panic twisted in Sean’s spine at the memory of the pieces of brick firing across the dyke. Ebdo carefully removed each foaming wedge from the liquid, like it was just another part of the job. A desperation for Ebdo to defend himself was climbing inside Sean’s chest. Mehmet, though, had become distracted, moving away to show something on his phone to Dougie. Sean slit open a new bag of chips and emptied them into his drawer. There was a lemon wedge on the floor near his feet. He tried to bend to pick it up but suddenly his body would not move. He could see the chunk of brick, still in Frank’s hand. He remembered the brief moment of nothingness afterwards, Frank muttering, “Shit, shit, shit”. Then, the boy’s head cradled in his own fingers, and not knowing what to do, and looking up to see everybody else, Frank, running away. By the time the orders stopped coming in, Mehmet was already in the storeroom, on his phone, or preparing the wages. He had not spoken to Sean yet about putting him on the books. When he came out, he had the envelopes in his hand. He went down the line and told each worker apart from Ebdo that they could turn off their fryer and finish cleaning down. A short time later, the weekend boy and Zac had left. Only Sean and Ebdo, Dougie and Mehmet remained. Mehmet held the envelopes up above his head. “Come and get them!” Fleetingly, Sean and Ebdo met each other’s eyes. Sean went forward to where Mehmet, standing behind Ebdo, was already holding out his wage packet. Once he had taken it, Sean did not move. Mehmet’s glare was on him but Sean kept his eyes on the envelope in his hand, and stayed where he was. “Go home,” Mehmet said. Dougie was by the entrance to the storeroom. At the edge of his vision, Sean could see him waving. “Bye, bye,” Dougie cooed. Sean did not look at Ebdo as he walked out of the pod. In the collection area, he stopped. A dark rectangle of night was in front of him. Frank’s bike, waiting in the shelter, the ride home – he could visualise himself moving towards it, as if a different person was now stepping out of his body to get away from here, to be on the road and then alone in his bedsit, clambering stiffly and blissfully onto his bed. But he could sense – even as he watched the ghost of himself leaving – his feet still planted on the floor, and he knew, before he turned to see Mehmet crumpling the banknotes, Dougie laughing, that he would not come back to this place again after tonight. None of them noticed him at first. Ebdo was looking into his fryer. Mehmet had the flat of his hand against Ebdo’s back, coaxing him towards the fryer, and Sean understood. “Better get it out quick,” Dougie was saying – and then he turned to see Sean. “Fuck you still here for?” His attention, though, went straight back to Mehmet and Ebdo, the spectacle at the fryer. If Mehmet knew that Sean was there, he was ignoring him. He was studying Ebdo, watching closely as he reached for his tongs. “No,” Mehmet said quietly. “With your hands.” Ebdo stared into the fryer, at his money seething in the oil. His expression gave nothing away although Sean, treading closer, could see that Ebdo’s hand, when he raised it to hover above the fryer, was shaking. The pain, for the first second or two, did not register. Then it came – tearing like a barb of metal up Sean’s wrists and forearm. Mehmet and Dougie stood, powerless, while Ebdo reacted quickly – lifting Sean’s hand out of the oil and guiding him away to a sink, the yellowed money still gripped in his hand until Ebdo could tease it out and place Sean’s hand and arm under the running water – holding him there – a pure, exhilarating pain moving through Sean’s arm and into his shoulder, his chest, until his whole body was alight, a rapture of fire. He did not know how much time had passed when he heard the dim wail of the ambulance coming through the industrial zone. He was sitting outside, on a plastic chair that Ebdo had found in Unit 2; a fire blanket, the only soft thing in the building, gathered around his shoulders. He could piece together only fragments: Mehmet and Dougie running away into the night, the boiled banknotes lying on the floor like damp flowerheads, the shock of new pain when Ebdo had slowly wrapped his hand with cling film. Ebdo, sitting on the ground beside him, had heard the siren too. He started to get to his feet and Sean hurriedly reached his good hand into his jeans pocket for his own wage envelope. Ebdo, standing above Sean now, shook his head, smiling, and Sean let the stillness of the night begin to seep through him – the glow of the city, and further out, his parents at home; Frank, waiting for their visit – as he watched the ambulance arrive and Ebdo walking away, his outline gradually disappearing into the soft blue pulse of air. • Ghost Kitchen appears in the BBC National Short Story Award 2024 anthology (Comma Press, £8.99)."

          "bodyText": "I love cooking rice, from paella to soupy stews and everything in between. What I enjoy most, though, is when a rice dish is seasonal and designed for sharing and bringing people together. Today’s recipe highlights autumnal wild mushrooms, and it’s essential to balance the texture and flavour of the rice and stock. A top-quality stock is crucial here, too, so I’d really recommend making your own or buying the best you can afford. Due to droughts in parts of Spain, some autumn mushrooms are unobtainable this year, so I’ve suggested using dried porcini instead. Wild mushroom rice This makes a great vegetarian main, as well as a delicious side. Prep 10 min Steep 10 min Cook 35 min Serves 4-6 10g dried porcini 50ml olive oil 2 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped 250g mixed fresh wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles, girolles, chicken of the woods, roughly ripped if large 300g bomba rice 100ml dry white wine 800ml good chicken stock Salt and black pepper A squeeze of lemon juice, to serve 30g manchego shavings, to serve Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve Put the dried porcini in a small bowl, pour over 100ml just-boiled water and leave to stand for at least 10 minutes. Put the olive oil in a saute pan on a medium-low heat, then gently fry the shallots for five minutes, until tender. Turn up the heat a little, add the fresh mushrooms and fry for four or five minutes, until nicely golden brown. Add the rice, stir it in the oily juices to coat, then add the wine and leave to bubble for a minute. Pour in all the stock, season generously, then turn down the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until the rice is tender but still quite soupy. Drain the rehydrated porcini, reserving their soaking liquid, then stir them into the pot with 50ml of their liquor. Cook for just a minute more, then turn off the heat. Stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, then spoon into bowls, top with the cheese shavings and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and serve."

          "headline": "‘Game-changer’ Phoebe Litchfield rediscovers the fun – and form follows",
          "bodyText": "Here is a story that says a lot about cricket’s next-generation star, Phoebe Litchfield. When she was 16 and a relative newcomer to the Sydney Thunder in the WBBL, Litchfield decided to play a prank on a newly arrived “rookie” on the team, who happened to be the England captain Heather Knight. With the team camped in a Covid lockdown bubble in a Sydney hotel for two months, Litchfield wrestled the mattress from her own room down the hallway and stood it up across her illustrious teammate’s door, which Knight discovered when she tried to leave her room. What does this say about Litchfield? She can find the fun in any situation, she’s willing to take a risk and she’s not daunted by reputation. That pretty much explains her rise from teen prodigy to a 21-year-old middle order batter who is expected to bring the “X factor” to the Australian team that will defend the T20 World Cup title in Sharjah and Dubai over the next three weeks. Litchfield hails from Orange in central western New South Wales where she first learned her craft from her father Andrew, a local vet and former Sydney grade cricketer, who heads Cricket NSW’s western region female academy in his spare time. His daughter’s hand-eye coordination was apparent from the time she was five years old. By 14, the little left-hander was playing men’s grade cricket alongside her dad, who does confess to some anxious moments when she was facing adult male fast bowlers on difficult wickets. “But she actually handled it well,” he says. “That’s probably when I realised that she had a real aptitude for being gritty and watching the ball and batting. She not only managed to score runs and handle herself, she looked as though she enjoyed it. She’d come off [the field] with a smile on her face. She loved the challenge of getting in the middle and trying to score runs. And I think that’s something she’s never lost.” At 15, Litchfield was playing in the first grade men’s competition in Orange when she was selected for the Australian under-19 women’s team. She was also playing hockey, and was named in the Australian under-16 team that would be touring at the same time. Something had to give, and when Cricket NSW came through with a contract to play for the Sydney Thunder she took it. She juggled school and playing in the WBBL for a couple of years before moving to Sydney to study communications at the University of Technology Sydney and play cricket. Her ascent to the highest level of the sport happened rapidly. She made her T20 debut for Australia in late 2022 against India, scored back-to-back unbeaten half-centuries in her first ODI matches against Pakistan in early 2023, followed by an Ashes Test in England, a maiden ODI century against Ireland and a successful ODI tour of India, where she averaged 86.66. It was enough to earn her the ICC’s emerging cricketer of the year award last year. But a full international schedule took a toll on the youngster. Earlier this year the runs started to dry up and she lost the fun as she struggled to meet her own high standards. By the end of the summer it was apparent that fatigue was eroding her form. “She had just played so much cricket in such a short space of time, and it’s really hard to sort of step back and take a break and kind of refresh mentally as much as physically,” says Leah Poulton, Cricket NSW’s Head of Cricket (Women). “I think everybody knew that Phoebe just needed a break at some point where she could go away and think about things that weren’t cricket, and then she came back to training and was actually able to train and work on things. At that age, they really need those development windows.” Litchfield used that time to regroup, work on her technique, and she returned to play a starring role in The Hundred in England in July and August, when she scored 450 runs at a strike rate of 130.43 for the Northern Superchargers. Her strong form confirmed her place in the Australian team for the T20 World Cup and she joined her teammates for last week’s three-match warm-up series against New Zealand in Queensland, which gave a glimpse of what we may see from Litchfield in her first outing on the global stage. She scored a career-high 64 in the opening match in Mackay, reaching her half-century off 32 balls and going on to smash the winning runs with a daring reverse sweep over the in-field to the boundary. “Any runs is good runs,” she said after producing an array of drives, pulls and sweeps, conventional and otherwise. “I’m not really looking to play for selection, I’m just playing for the love of the game and also the fact that I get to play for this team … it was just so much fun out there. The way we want to play is an attacking brand of cricket and it will come off sometimes and sometimes it won’t. We are always looking to score.” Coach Shelley Nitschke called it an “exceptional” innings. Litchfield now has the highest strike rate of any woman who has scored more than 200 international runs since the last World Cup. She has passed her first real test of resilience and the fun is back. Former international cricketer Poulton predicts Litchfield will be a “game-changer’’ for women’s cricket as she continues to develop. “The thing that makes Phoebe such a fantastic player is that she’s just got this aggressiveness about her style of play out there, looking to score runs every ball,” Poulton says. “And for someone on the sideline, it just looks fearless out there, throwing caution to the wind. “That can get beaten out of you in international cricket. If you have a couple of poor series or whatever, then you can go a bit more defensive. But that aggression is Phoebe’s strength, so it was nice to see her come out against New Zealand and just play like Phoebe Litchfield. When you watch Phoebe, the excitement is because you feel like you are watching the future.” The Australian team that will defend the World Cup is a blend of established stars and youngsters like Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Darcie Brown. The champion thirtysomethings – captain Alyssa Healy, opening bat Beth Mooney and all-rounder Ellyse Perry – still dominate the top order, but the next generation is hungry for honours to match those who have come before. Poulton has no doubt that Litchfield will thrive in this environment. “She’s ready to go and light it up at the World Cup,” she says."

          "bodyText": "Writer-director Michael Felker makes his feature debut with this trudgingly downbeat sci-fi, an uncanny-realist time travel movie about a couple of criminals hiding out in the future; it’s a little in the style of Shane Carruth’s Primer or Rian Johnson’s Looper – though without the thrills, and without the cerebral frissons and ingenious plot contrivances where those thrills would otherwise go. It is produced by film-makers Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who established a kind of authorial stamp on this kind of indie hipster-cosmic fantasy with their own (more interesting) film The Endless. Things Will Be Different is about a dour and bearded drug dealer called Joseph (Adam David Thompson) who reconnects with his sister, single-mom Sidney (Riley Dandy), from whom he has long been estranged after their troubled childhood. He has pulled off some kind of robbery or con and is in possession of a bag full of millions of dollars; he meets up with Sidney who wants a better life for herself and her daughter, a future in which things will be different. So Joseph offers to let Sidney in on this new bonanza, but first they will have to hide out together for 14 days in a remote farmhouse that one of his clients has told him about. It’s a dusty, eerie place where, if you follow the secret procedure on its old-fashioned dialler phone and alter the time on the hands of its various grandfather clocks, you will be transported 14 days into the future (though in the same place), after which you can come back when the heat has died down. Inevitably, after a very long montage-type depiction of their calm life in this rural time bubble, things go terribly wrong on Day 14 and they are stranded in mortal danger, but also enduring much boredom and Beckettian futility. (When “Day 352” flashes up on screen, you’ll feel like you’ve lived through it with them.) They have to communicate across time with the shadowy figures in control via a laborious method involving a tape machine on a chain in a safe in a mill (separate from the house) which houses a crepuscular chapel. Despite an intriguing high-concept lo-fi premise, its oddities and uninteresting superfluities mean that it never really emerges from its self-imposed inertia and gloom. • Things Will Be Different is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 October"

          "headline": "‘It commemorates collective moments’: Radiohead through the eyes of Colin Greenwood",
          "bodyText": "The story of one of Britain’s biggest bands of the past 30 years didn’t begin with rowdy rehearsal rooms or rock’n’roll lore. It started with five school friends in drafty village halls in rural Oxfordshire, paying £1.50 per band member to the keeper of the keys, moving rubber crash mats and plywood chairs to set up their equipment. In barely more than a decade, they were headlining arenas and festivals. The sweet story of Radiohead’s rise is documented in How to Disappear, a new book by bassist Colin Greenwood, big brother of guitarist Jonny and lifelong friend of singer Thom Yorke, guitarist Ed O’Brien and drummer Phil Selway. Ostensibly a photographic record of their working lives after 2003, when he started taking a camera with him into the studio and on stage, it also includes a beautifully written 10,000-word essay on the experiences they’ve shared. “The perspective is uniquely my own,” Greenwood writes of his photographs. “I have spent nearly all my working life either on stage or tucked away in a recording studio, where I’ve tried to catch out my friends with my Yashica T4 Super camera, a black analogue plastic box that records light, like our vinyl does sound.” These times are also punctuated by long stretches for which the band members are apart, he adds, which he reflects on tenderly. “When we do reunite, it’s like plunging into the latest season of a long-running box set: everything essentially the same but all of us just that little bit older… coming back together at these moments is both addictive and reassuring – a communion through music.” I meet Greenwood holed up in the book-lined snug of his publisher, just before he heads off on tour with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (as well as contributing to their new album, Wild God, he’s standing in for Bad Seed Martyn Casey, absent on grounds of ill health). A gentle, generous soul, Greenwood is touched when his writing and photography are praised, crediting two “old friends” for making it happen: editor Nicholas Pearson, who encouraged him to put pen to paper, and Charlotte Cotton, one of three saxophonists when the band were starting out in the mid-1980s (when they were called On a Friday), who became a photography curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum. “She helped foster and mentor my interest in the early 1990s,” Greenwood explains, sitting in the corner of a sofa. His practice only began a decade later because “everything was so intense” for the band before then. As he struggled to work out how to frame these photographs in his words, he asked Nick Cave – an old hand at writing books – for advice. “And he said, where do these photos begin? You could write about what it felt like then, not to be at the top of your success, but not starting out either. What are you? Where are you going? So I began from there and everything else followed.” Radiohead’s 1990s had been a whirlwind, as Greenwood goes on to capture powerfully. Signed to EMI after only a handful of gigs, their debut single, 1992’s Creep, was, in his words, a “sugar-rush success”, its video played constantly on MTV, the mixture of longing and rage in its lyrics and sound getting it lumped in, unfairly, with other grunge-era slacker anthems. Their second album, The Bends, arrived in early 1995, a year that reached summer with Blur and Oasis battling for No 1 and Pulp headlining Glastonbury. Full of strangely beautiful songs about iron lungs, rubber men and fallen skies, it had little in common with the surrounding hubbub of Britpop and took time to take off. “I spoke to so many music writers who’d received The Bends as a promo, left it to gather dust on top of their PC tower, and hadn’t bothered to play it until word of mouth nudged them,” Greenwood writes. Four singles with powerful videos saw them move up the charts: their last from The Bends, Street Spirit (Fade Out), got to No 5, with a video by Jonathan Glazer (later to direct Under the Skin and The Zone of Interest). Support slots with REM in the UK and Alanis Morissette in the US, and their music being used in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, also helped. “It meant that when we released OK Computer [in May 1997] nobody wanted to make the mistake of missing out on us again.” OK Computer went five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, allowing the band to buy and convert a Thameside barn and its outbuildings into a studio. This home-from-home features in this book’s earliest pictures and pops up in the years after that: we see a studio blackboard featuring potential track names from 2003’s Hail to the Thief, and a snap of artist Stanley Donwood, painting that album’s colourful cover in one of its cowsheds. The tone is private, unpolished, unglamorous. Here is Thom scribbling lyrics, Ed shattered after a night on the tour bus, the whole band wandering on stony sand by the sea. There are plenty of pictures of Jonny, who has never minded his brother’s interventions: pushing a luggage trolley through a silent American airport, looking impish at a mixing desk, playing a viola in a bath to create an interesting sound. He has possibly the world’s most photogenic cheekbones. This isn’t a tempestuous fraternal relationship, I say – Colin laughs when I mention the Gallaghers. “Well… we’re just very English and very self-contained, really.” Then he speaks with incredible tenderness. “I love working with Jonny, and I love being on stage with him, watching him play and riff furiously.” Influenced by photographers such as Gaylord Oscar Herron and Tim Barber’s mid-2000s website Tiny Vices, featuring “snaps of small pleasures, photos of friends, road trips documented with 35mm cameras like mine – beautifully curated with an expert eye”, much of the book is charmingly quotidian, but hints of their hugeness trickle through. It’s hard to miss the faded grandeur of the 16th-century manor house on Jane Seymour’s Marlborough estate, their recording space for 2007’s In Rainbows, the many boxes of gig gear backstage, and a lovely shot of Thom singing Spectre – a song commissioned but ultimately rejected for the 2015 Bond theme – in a booth in Air Studios, looking out at an orchestra. The book ends with shots from mega-gigs in the US, Canada and Ireland after their last album, 2016’s A Moon Shaped Pool. Greenwood takes pictures on stage when his bass isn’t required, and also writes about touring life, enjoying reggae, beer, books and chess with the backline crew, and tea and toast as he sits and stares at the “unending deserts and prairies… feeling gloriously cut adrift until shimmering skyscrapers appeared on the horizon, our next port of call”. Radiohead last toured together in 2018. Thom and Jonny have made two albums as the Smile with Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner; O’Brien and Selway have solo projects; Colin’s now busy with the Bad Seeds. Where does Radiohead exist now? “We did some rehearsals in, I can’t remember, June or May? Let’s say early June. We just ran through some stuff this summer specifically just to see how it felt and just to reconnect. It was really good.” He also talks touchingly about Ed’s 2020 debut album, Earth, under the name EOB, and Phil’s “amazing” gig with Portishead’s Adrian Utley a few years ago at the Union Chapel. “Everyone’s been very supportive of one another’s projects,” he says. It’s all terribly grownup behaviour. Colin’s photographs – delicate, warm, unobtrusive – also feel supportive of his friends, but I wonder what kept him taking photographs all these years. He thinks for a while, then a theory starts to bubble up. “Maybe taking pictures is a way of celebrating and commemorating these moments that are collective – moments that are shared with all these people on stage and all the people off stage, too.” It’s also made him reflect on the blessings of being in a band all this time – it’ll be 40 years in 2025 – of getting the opportunity to play with them, and the joy of capturing them unawares when they’re about to perform or record. “Or when they’re getting ready or meditating or yawning or doing anything, really.” Greenwood smiles. “They’re still allowing me there when the last thing they want around is an idiot with a camera.” • How to Disappear by Colin Greenwood is published by John Murray (£26).

          "bodyText": "Senior Tories are already predicting that whoever wins the Conservative leadership race is unlikely to survive until the next election, amid criticisms of a “B-list” contest that risks taking the party farther to the right. Some veteran figures have decided to give this weekend’s conference in Birmingham a miss, fearing the party has learned little from the complete loss of discipline that characterised its final years in government. With former prime minister Liz Truss lined up to give a speech to the party masses and Boris Johnson publishing his memoirs, including claims of an aborted idea of invading the Netherlands to seize Covid vaccines, they say the event looks on course to confirm their misgivings. However, apart from the outbursts from former Tory leaders, there are rumblings that none of the four candidates to be the party’s next figurehead – Kemi Badenoch, Robert Jenrick, Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly – have the obvious qualities to unite the party’s factions and make a swift return to power. “It’s like one of those celebrity reality TV shows where you don’t actually recognise any of the celebrities,” said one recently departed Tory minister. “It feels like a B-list selection. We are probably going to make a stupid decision. We will have to get this out of our system in order to make the right decision next time.” The depression that has descended on some senior Tories comes before a conference dominated by the leadership race. The four hopefuls will make onstage Q&amp;A appearances before their all-important speeches, designed to win over colleagues and convince Tory members that they are the right candidate to lead the party to recovery. The four will be whittled down to two candidates via a ballot of Tory MPs after the conference, before members make the final selection. It is hoped the format of the race would allow the four to be properly tested and avoid the disaster of Truss’s prime ministership or the communication struggles of Theresa May, who was ultimately crowned leader unopposed. Yet the run-up to the conference has been dominated by scratchy battles over speech lengths and timings, as well as disputed claims of preferential treatment – some insiders accuse Conservative HQ of favouring Badenoch. But one former cabinet minister said that several figures in the party were having doubts about how long the next incumbent would even be in the role, because none seem capable of holding together a party that has been pulling apart for years. They said: “I’ve heard this from a few people, thinking: ‘Why are we getting excited about this? Because it will happen again between now and the general election.’ We’re not talking about the next Conservative prime minister yet. We don’t know what we are at the moment. “Tugendhat’s too left for the right, Kemi’s too right for the left. Jenrick is just unexciting and attempting to be something that he isn’t, which leaves Cleverly.” Others, however, describe Cleverly as too close to Rishi Sunak’s regime to represent a fresh start. Many expect tensions to bubble up in some of the conference outings. One senior figure said he was worried about Badenoch’s ability to “start a fight in an empty room”. The continuing doubts over the party’s future direction are borne out by the latest Opinium polling for the Observer, which shows that voters no longer know what the Conservative party stands for, and believe it is disunited and lacking a clear sense of purpose. Over the last three years, the Conservatives have dropped 25 points in terms of whether voters know what the party stands for. The party has dropped 18 points in terms of having a clear sense of purpose and 22 points on perceived unity. Although the Tories are very much seen as being out of touch, they scored relatively badly on this measure even when they were doing well in the polls back in 2021. While the candidates are relatively unknown to the wider public, there are also worrying signs that those who voted Tory in its 2019 election win are not enamoured of the options on offer either. Among that group, Badenoch is the most unacceptable option, with 27% unhappy about the prospect of her were to be elected. The others are not far behind, with 24% saying Cleverly would be unacceptable as leader, 20% saying the same about Tugendhat and 17% about Jenrick. One senior Tory source also questioned Jenrick’s record, suggesting it was “extraordinary” that he had faced so little scrutiny for his role in the controversial approval of a Tory donor’s housing development in 2020. They feared the saga would gain fresh attention should Jenrick become leader. Then the housing secretary, Jenrick intervened to approve Richard Desmond’s £1bn property scheme in east London. The pair had recently sat next to each other at a Tory fundraising dinner. Others also criticised him for retaining links to aides who had been involved in the so-called “grid of shit” plot to destabilise Sunak during his prime ministership – something Jenrick’s team has firmly denied. Such are the doubts about whether the party is ready to unite that some are already discussing the return of Johnson in a couple of years’ time, should the next leader be struggling to make an impression on the Labour government. “He will time his run quite carefully, once he’s got £10m in the bank,” said one of his former cabinet team. “He won’t want to be leader of the opposition – he’ll want to be prime minister.” Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, said there was little sign the party had come to terms with its huge election loss. “The impression given to voters is of a party in denial. Conservative leadership candidates have so far attempted to ‘style it out’, behaving as if the party just lost by a few seats, rather than the near two-thirds cull of MPs that took place,” she writes in the Observer today. “The party has to jolt itself back into the real world. With Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats now in parliament in force, politically waiting to eat them up, this chance won’t last for ever.”"

          "bodyText": "Sometimes political leaders send up a test balloon on a policy idea to gauge public reaction. The news that Treasury officials have been working on possible fresh housing measures, including options for changing negative gearing and capital gains tax, was not one of those times. Since the promise to pare back negative gearing helped Labor lose an election they thought they’d win in 2019, nobody in the Albanese government has even dared to whisper about the possibility of doing it again. Not until this week and the accidental balloon. The clue that Nine newspapers’ mid-week revelation was an unauthorised disclosure and not a deliberate balloon-shaped leak was all over the treasurer’s face when his attempt to trumpet a stunning drop in the monthly inflation figure was foiled by questions on negative gearing. “First of all, the real story today is inflation,” Jim Chalmers insisted, after the first question at his Wednesday news conference ignored inflation altogether. “The story today is about a substantial moderation in headline and underlying inflation in our economy. We’ve got a housing policy, and that’s not in it. We’ve made that clear today.” But it wasn’t really clear and six more questions about negative gearing followed. The ghost of policies past even followed him to Beijing, where he made the first visit by an Australian treasurer in seven years. There, after days of speculation about how treasury came to be working on this advice, Chalmers continued to walk a careful line. “When it comes to negative gearing changes, it is not unusual at all for governments or for treasurers to get advice on contentious issues which are in the public domain, including in the Parliament,” he told journalists. “It is not unusual for treasurers to do that, but we have made it very clear through the course of this week that we have a broad and ambitious housing policy already, and those changes aren’t part of it.” He said it’s not unusual for treasurers to get advice but he didn’t actually say whether he’d asked for – or received – any. It would be a bit unusual if treasury officials were working on options for adjusting such a controversial policy measure without the treasurer at least knowing about it. Word is, while advice may have been prepared on policy options, it hasn’t yet gone up the hill. Chalmers’ protestations notwithstanding, not much has been “very clear” about the government’s public responses in the days since the newspaper report appeared. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, tried to wave the issue away, saying the government had no “plans” to make changes – a language construct he also used when asked many times if he would amend the Coalition’s tax cuts in the months before he did. In that case, it was a denial and then it wasn’t. So you can see why this kind of response might not exactly stop the questions. “We have no plans to touch or change negative gearing,” Albanese said on Thursday. “What we’re concerned about is supply of housing.” He added that he was “not convinced” that paring back the concessions underpinning negative gearing would help supply. When Labor under Bill Shorten proposed the move, its plan was to grandfather all existing arrangements and restrict future arrangements to newly constructed homes. Then, it was pitched as a housing supply measure. Even if that argument could be made again, the political appetite for making it seems vanishingly small. It’s less evident that the same goes for any adjustment to capital gains tax arrangements. It’s just not clear because there’ve been no definitive denials. In the midst of a flurry of interviews featuring the “no plans” lines, Albanese made a slightly more absolute-sounding statement when ABC News Breakfast host Bridget Brennan asked for clarity on Thursday, on behalf of viewers. “Are you considering taking negative gearing reform and capital gains tax reform to the next election?” Brennan asked. “No, we’re not,” the prime minister responded. Of course, politicians aren’t considering something until they are. Still not really clear. At a news conference on Friday, he was not repeating that language and the only thing clear was his irritation. Asked, again, for clarity, he said: “Just for clarity, what we are doing is what we have before the parliament. So I talk about what we’re doing, not what we’re not doing.” The refusal to be clear or even consistent means the rogue balloon remains aloft. Contrast that with another time under this government that something floated into the public domain and got caught in a force-10 gale. On that occasion it also involved the treasurer, though then by his own hand. On 20 February last year, Chalmers addressed the Australian Superannuation Funds of Australia and raised concerns about the sustainability of the tax concessions on superannuation balances. “I think it is important that we recognise if our big task is to make superannuation sustainable, then this kind of conversation shouldn’t be off the table,” he said at the time. It was certainly a dispatch with all the characteristics of a test balloon. Unfortunately for both treasurer and government, the journey skyward began without a tethering strategy and the damn thing got away. Doing something about capping super concessions was a live discussion inside the government at the time but there had been no actual policy decision. They hadn’t even fixed on where such a cap should be set. The opposition seized on Chalmers’ big thought bubble and the debate exploded. The government didn’t want the idea itself to go the same way. Within two days, the treasurer was seizing control of the renegade blimp and trying to steer it to a safe landing. He doubled down on the proposal and started speculating about capping concessions once contributions hit the $3m mark. Just over a week after the balloon went up, Chalmers and Albanese announced their new policy – a concession cap on contributions above $3m. But it’s a bit different this time. On whether something might be going on with negative gearing or capital gains tax or both, it seems a notion has taken off without anyone from the government letting it go. At week’s end, it was still on the loose. Maybe they think it will just quietly deflate and drift back to earth. But speculation has a remarkable capacity to remain airborne. History suggests to avoid a nasty crash there are only two ways to deal effectively with a political balloon that gets away, whether as a tester or a rogue release. It needs to either be hauled back in and tethered to some kind of announcement, or burst. Karen Middleton is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

          "bodyText": "The competition regulator has announced it is suing Coles and Woolworths over allegations they misled shoppers by offering “illusory” discounts on hundreds of common supermarket products. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said on Monday the regulator would seek a “a significant penalty” after the major retailers allegedly profited from the sale of tens of millions of products sold through promotions the regulator claimed breached consumer law. Coles told shareholders on Monday it intends to defend the proceedings, while Woolworths said it would review the claims. So how did we get here? What’s happened so far? Promotional prices at Coles and Woolworths were misleading and a breach of consumer law, the ACCC alleged, because they were usually higher than the products’ regular long-term prices. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The regulator has used specific product examples in the case documents to show the brevity of the price spikes at Australia’s two major supermarkets – which control two-thirds of the market. For example, Woolworths sold a family pack of Oreos for 696 days at $3.50, which the ACCC describes as its “regular price”. The price was hiked to $5 for 22 days, and then dropped to $4.50. Shoppers were told they were getting a discount even though the price was 29% higher than the long-term regular price. All up, 266 products sold at Woolworths followed a similar pattern, and 245 products at Coles, all of which had temporary price spikes of less than 45 days before being placed into promotions between 2021 and 2023. What does the law say? Jeremy Goldman, principal lawyer at Melbourne-based KCL Law, says when it comes to “was/is” promotions, interpreting consumer law is not an “exact science”. “The critical issue is whether or not consumers would have, in fact, paid the ‘was’ price for a reasonable period of time before the sale commenced. “The other question is what was the length of time that the product was previously offered for and was that a reasonable length of time.” Goldman says the size of any penalty could be influenced by the precautions supermarkets took in their promotions – if they obtained legal advice, it’s possible they just made the wrong decision based on the advice provided, he says. “But if the promotion was the ‘thought bubble’ of someone in the marketing department that did this without either obtaining legal advice or informing themselves of what the legal parameters are, that’s when you probably are going to receive a significant penalty,” Goldman says. Coles said in a statement the allegations relate to a period of significant inflation when it was receiving a large number of price increases from its suppliers. “Coles sought to strike an appropriate balance between managing the impact of cost price increases on retail prices and offering value to customers through the recommencement of promotional activity as soon as possible after the establishment of the new non-promotional price,” the supermarket said. Woolworths said it was committed to offering many ways for customers to save, including through specials, own brands and its rewards program. The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC), Erin Turner, says while the courts will determine the legality of the promotions, there’s a separate question over whether the supermarkets have acted fairly. “Great businesses don’t do this to their customers,” says Turner. “Anyone who’s run a small business or had to work with people knows that you shouldn’t take advantage of others.” Has this ever happened before? Comparative pricing promotions have long been a focus for the ACCC. In 2020, the federal court ordered Kogan to pay a fine over misleading customers about a tax time promotion in response to proceedings pursued by the regulator. The online retailer had told customers they could use the code “TAXTIME” to receive a 10% discount on products at the checkout but had increased the product prices by more than 10% shortly before the promotion. In 2019, four furniture retailers paid penalties for advertising a “was” price that either never existed or was only advertised for a short period of time. Three years earlier, British clothing retailer Charles Tyrwhitt paid a fine after advertising a $69 shirt that “was” $160. The retailer had advertised the “was” price “for a short period in a section of its website which was difficult to locate”, and no consumer had ever bought it at the high price, the ACCC said at the time. What’s the problem? Surveys conducted by consumer advocate Choicehave repeatedly shown that many consumers are confused by supermarket specials, with the “Down Down” and “Prices Dropped” promotions among those cited as a source of the problem. Last year, Guardian Australia analysis found that Woolworths had a practice of briefly lifting the price of Nescafé Gold before discounting it and advertising it as a promotional item. Anthony Albanese said on Monday if the allegations were found to be true it would be “completely unacceptable” behaviour by the supermarkets and that “specials need to be real, because household budgets are tight.” The ACCC found in a government-ordered interim report separate to the legal proceedings that Australia’s major supermarkets provide broadly similar products, prices and loyalty programs in an oligopolistic market that may limit incentives to compete vigorously."

          "bodyText": "Dame Maggie Smith’s trophy cabinet reflected her extraordinary achievements across theatre, film and television – and in the biggest arenas of British and US culture, from the BBC to Hollywood, the West End to Broadway. A measure of her versatility and durability is that, in the 1960s, she played nine major roles in the formative years of the National Theatre, but also, from the start of the 2000s, appeared in five series of Downton Abbey, the ITV Sunday night series that became one of the biggest popular hits of the new millennium. Her role in that show was Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, who lived in such a bubble of exclusive comfort that, in trademark one-liners, she would drawl in mystification, for example: “What is a ‘weekend’?” That acerbic superiority was a signature throughout Smith’s career, including the part that brought her first Academy award in 1970, against a shortlist also featuring Liza Minnelli and Jane Fonda, for the title role in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, adapted from Muriel Spark’s novel about a maverick, arrogant schoolteacher in Edinburgh. Smith consistently had the courage and talent to do unexpected things. Her second Oscar, in 1979, was for California Suite, with a script by Neil Simon and a cast of high Hollywood talent including Alan Alda and Walter Matthau. Introducing an element of postmodernism to a mainstream comedy, Smith played exactly what she had been at the start of the decade: an English actress up for her first Academy award. Another surprise on her CV demonstrated an ability to play it straight and dark. In 2019, after 12 years away from the stage, Smith, at the age of 84, performed a 100-minute monologue at the Bridge theatre in London. A German Life was adapted by Christopher Hampton from a documentary movie interview given, at the age of 102 (the show was a rare case of an octogenarian ageing up for a part), by Brunhilde Pomsel, who worked for the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels during the Holocaust, but who continued to deny complicity or guilt. With typical meticulousness, Smith refused to accept the part until she had proved to herself at home that she could memorise an extended solo. Combining enduringly impeccable technique with the guts to test it again at such an age, it was a late triumph in an astonishing career. Margaret Smith – she preferred her full first name, the “Maggie” imposed on her to distinguish from another performer on the Equity register – was born in Ilford, Essex. Her mother, who worked as a secretary, was Scottish, so useful for the creation of the Brodie brogue. Her father, Nathaniel, was a pathologist, whose academic posting to Oxford led to his daughter attending the city’s girls’ high school. Despite joining the Oxford Playhouse Company at 16, rather than going to college, Smith benefited from the local varsity theatrical privileges, cast in Oxford University Dramatic Society productions, including revues, which, at the time were attended by national critics. Such was the impact she made in comedy skits and songs that, aged 21, she was part of an ensemble recruited to appear on Broadway in a revue called New Faces of 1956. In London, during the following two years, she appeared, with co-stars including Kenneth Williams, in an English show, Share My Lettuce, billed as “a diversion with music”, with a script by Bamber Gascoigne. At that point, Smith seemed set to be a sketch-and-music comedian, especially when Strip the Willow, a play about the survivors of a nuclear war in the UK, failed to transfer to London from a UK tour. It was written by Beverley Cross, whom Smith had met at the Oxford Playhouse. He wrote the play for her as an attempted seduction, the first description of her character being “beautiful. As elegant and sophisticated as a top international model. A great sense of fun. A marvellous girl.’’ However, at that stage, no lasting relationship occurred. And Smith’s serious dramatic career was launched when she appeared, again paired with Kenneth Williams, in a double bill of plays, The Private Ear and The Public Eye, by Peter Shaffer, in 1962. These won Smith her first Evening Standard best actress statuette, at the age of 27, and caught the attention of Sir Laurence Olivier, then establishing, at Chichester, the first attempt at a National Theatre. Crucially to the development of her reputation, Olivier trusted her not only with comedy – such as The Recruiting Officer, George Farquhar’s early 18th-century farce – but also tragedy: she was Desdemona to Olivier’s performance in the title role of Othello. Also at the National, Smith formed a relationship with the actor Robert Stephens, who became her first husband, and father of her sons, who, as Toby Stephens and Chris Larkin, followed their parents into acting. Dramatic Exchanges, a collection of correspondence from the National Theatre archives, shows the close creative relationship between Olivier and Smith. A habitual nicknamer, he addressed her as “Mageen”. He had long told her that her perfect role would be Millamant, a strong-willed woman conspiring to achieve a desired marriage, in William Congreve’s Restoration comedy The Way of the World. But, in 1968, with Smith having left the company following her marriage with Stephens and pregnant with their first child, Olivier proceeded to stage the play with Geraldine McEwan as Millamant. Olivier’s letter of apology to Smith contained elaborately verbose admiration. Smith wrote a reply of pained regret concluding: “Well, what’s the point of trying to tell you my feelings. They obviously count for so very little. It was nice of you to say you will devote your energies to my return but really I do not think it would be wise of me to believe that either. Margaret.” There is a waspish, unforgiving tone in that letter that was part of Smith’s personality; some of those who worked with her, especially younger actors struggling with their roles, were wounded by witty but cruel putdowns. That bad casting luck at the National, though, was more than balanced out. Had Julie Andrews, in the same year, not turned down the Jean Brodie movie, Smith would never have played the part that redefined her career. With her American bankability increased by a US tour of Noël Coward’s Private Lives, Smith used it to go into a kind of theatrical exile from Olivier and Britain. From 1976 to 1980, she played four summer seasons at the Shakespeare festival in Stratford, Ontario, conceived as a sort of ex-pat RSC-National, where she finally played the part of Millamant and other roles that might have been expected in London, such as Lady Macbeth. Smith fell into a happy rhythm of filming gigs split with Canadian acting sabbaticals. While she rehearsed or acted, Beverley Cross wrote to her, having become Smith’s second husband in 1975 following her divorce from Robert Stephens. When Smith returned to London theatre, she took over from Diana Rigg as the troubled modern colonial wife Ruth Carson, in Tom Stoppard’s Night and Day. She confirmed her resurgence with two more Evening Standard awards, in 1981 and 1984, for London runs of shows she had premiered in Canada. In Virginia, by Edna O’Brien, she was the writer Virginia Woolf, for whom Smith’s gift for haughty wit made her natural casting. Then, 16 years after the disappointment with Olivier, she finally played the coveted role in The Way of the World in her own city. Smith, in contradiction of the standard professional graphs, had, after that slight mid-career dip, a third act even more glorious than her first. Shaffer wrote for her Lettice and Lovage, a comedy maximising her command of sardonic superiority, as Lettice Douffet, a tour guide who begins to embellish history. She took the play to New York, where she won a Tony award. Smith also became an Alan Bennett specialist. She co-starred with Michael Palin in the movie A Private Function in 1984, as a Yorkshire woman using a black-market pig to prevent wartime rationing thwarting her upward mobility. In the 1988 first series of Bennett’s Talking Heads monologues for television, she was a vicar’s wife, anxious about private sins, in A Bed Among the Lentils. On stage (1999) and screen (2015), she was memorable as The Lady in the Van, a fictionalised version of Miss Shepherd, a Catholic evangelist tramp who for some years lived in a caravan on Bennett’s driveway. There was a trio of West End appearances in plays by the great American dramatist Edward Albee: as the oldest (90-something) of three versions of the writer’s imperious mother in Three Tall Women (1994); playing a vicious drunk in a family menaced by an unnamed “plague” in A Delicate Balance (1997); and a mysterious matriarch visiting a deathbed in The Lady from Dubuque (2007), a rare flop that put Smith off theatre. Another reason for her retreat from theatre was, unusually for a septuagenarian performer, a vast demand from movie studios. Between 2001 and 2011, she appeared in seven of the eight Harry Potter films, as Professor Minerva McGonagall, transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts, her embodiment of the formidable Scottish academic seeming to contain affectionate nods to Brodie. The part brought Smith considerable wealth – she joked about the “Harry Potter pension fund” – and a vast new fanbase that, she complained, made it impossible for her to shop in Waitrose any more. Her cinematic renaissance had also included Robert Altman’s Gosford Park (2001). In this English country house drama, written by Julian Fellowes, Smith’s character was at least a first cousin to her Downton Abbey countess. Appearing in a TV series with an average audience of 10 million made it even harder for Dame Maggie (as she had become in 1990) to go shopping. But this late superstardom, half a century or more after her first major theatre and movie successes, confirmed that she was an actor with the rare ability to do anything she wanted anywhere. • This article was amended on 27 September 2024.

          "headline": "Mary’s, London W1: ‘New name, new menu, softer edges’ – restaurant review",
          "bodyText": "“Mary’s” sounds like a biker bar in Missouri, but it’s actually a smart-casual brasserie from Jason Atherton close to Hanover Square, London. It was, until recently, Pollen Street Social, but it’s now a case of new name, new menu, softer edges, and more of a come-one come-all, pre-theatre, boozy-treat, long-lunch vibe. Taking a Michelin-starred restaurant and turning it “casual” is always controversial in the foodie world. Not only are you pricking the bubble of those who adore pomp and small portions, but you’re also annoying people who like telling you that they’ve experienced this pomp everywhere from Dundee to Dubai. So when the likes of Atherton suddenly tells staff they can wear jeans, begin serving steaks and doughnuts, and allow the words “Mary’s dirty burger” to enter the fray, pearls will be clutched. Or, more accurately, someone called Douglas in a cummerbund in Cirencester will insist furiously that Mary’s was better in 2012, when his meal took three hours and there were more dishes with translucent, 42-hour consommé and shards of yeast. The paper tablecloths, the soft-serve ice-cream sundaes, the offer of curry mayo on the two-course £29 prix fixe are all daggers to the heart of fancy diners. It’s important, however, to say right now that Mary’s, despite everything above, retains rather a lot of pomp. Atherton has not gone mad, opened a Wimpy and begun serving slop. Quite the opposite: this is a large, elegant, pale room with plenty of light from the vast windows looking down on to Pollen Street. The walls are festooned with modern art, the staff are still drilled to politeness (they’re diligently friendly to solo diners) and, most importantly, chef Alex Parker’s menu is still secretly fancy. Expect Lyonnaise onion agnolotti, Orkney scallops with ajo blanco, rabbit leg with lovage persillade butter, grass-fed tomahawk and Cornish brill with surf clam pil pil. I have not faced down “Mary’s dirty burger”, but closer scrutiny tells me this is good-quality Cumbrian beef stacked with deep-fried pickles and served with Koffmann’s chips and a choice of black garlic aïoli or truffle mayo; you can also eat this burger sitting on a tall stool in the adjacent Blind Pig bar. Eagle-eyed readers might say, “But Atherton’s Blind Pig is a mile away on Poland Street?” Not any longer; the Blind Pig is now part of Mary’s. Over recent months, tracking the Atherton empire’s global transmogrifications requires a large whiteboard and several pens; he’s opened about 40 restaurants over the past 20 years, and now there’s Sael on St James’s Market, the forthcoming Three Darlings in Chelsea, Hot Dogs in Harrods and Row on 5 on Savile Row. Suffice to say, diners who are irked that the former Pollen Street Social is now more user-friendly is the least of Atherton’s worries. Not least because Mary’s is hugely enjoyable: she’s kicked off her shoes and taken the pins out of her barnet. No longer a place to eat daintily, this is now a place to eat rather too much. Expect things with posh names to be battered or breaded – apologies, in tempura or panko crumb – such as top-grade monkfish or a hash of duck breast served in a puddle of rich, silky satay sauce and topped with pickled cucumber. That chunk of tempura monkfish arrives crisp, hot and slathered with warm, freshly made tartare. A side of humble-sounding bobby beans come in a rich tomato fondue with fresh parsley, and there is globe artichoke barigoule for those grasping at health; however, if you’re here on Earth for a good but not a long time, please order the Lincolnshire potato with cabbage, onion and caviar, a soft, heavenly mush of cream, cheese, chive and roe. Or, for that matter, any of the day’s grilled fish – mackerel, john dory and skate on the day I went – which is served with lashings of café de Paris butter. The pudding list is, as you’d imagine, a menace to public health. There was a very good, warm, boozy, cheek-flushing doughnut with calvados-powered custard and plentiful cinnamon sugar, and a Basque cheesecake made with orange, chocolate and tonka bean. There is a chance that by 2028 Atherton might be running all the restaurants and employing all the chefs in the western hemisphere. I would try to be more uppity about this, but I’m still too high as a kite on the calvados doughnut to take the higher ground. Mary’s, 8-10 Pollen Street, London W1, 020-7290 7600. Open Tue-Sat, lunch noon –2.30pm, dinner 5.30-11pm (6.30pm prix fixe). About £60 a head à la carte; set menu two courses for £29, three for £35; all plus drinks and service. The next episode of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is out on Tuesday 1 October – listen to it here"

          "headline": "The real victims of Olivia Nuzzi’s affair with RFK Jr are other female journalists",
          "bodyText": "Anyone who is not a moralist or kidding themselves will admit that a good piece of gossip is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Gossip exposes the false sanctimony of the powerful: it reveals the smug and self-righteous to be grubby, selfish and embarrassing – just like the rest of us. If the pronouncements of politicians make history, and the reporting of the media shapes that history’s official narrative, gossip runs along behind them, like a bratty younger sibling, filling in their omissions to tell a truer story. “You left out this part.” “That’s not what you told me.” Maybe this is why media gossip about journalists and politicians carries such a frisson of transgressive delight: it breaks their monopoly on narrative authority. The people who have been appointed to tell us stories about our world, and about ourselves, finally get themselves subjected to the same treatment. It helps, too, to bust the bubble of a media industry that has long demanded more moral gravitas than it has really earned. These are the people, after all, who claim to be holding power to account. But how do they actually behave towards those in power? And so it was maybe predictable that so many people would feel a gleeful jolt of schadenfreude last week, when New York Magazine revealed that it had suspended Olivia Nuzzi, a young star reporter known for her biting wit and deep bench of Republican sources. The cause? Nuzzi had allegedly admitted to sexting with one of her reporting subjects: the anti-vax crusader, animal corpse desecrator, former presidential candidate and brain worm host Robert F Kennedy Jr. Love is blind, and it could be that Nuzzi simply has unconventional taste. But the incident has taken on heavy symbolic proportions, becoming a litmus test within media circles for various opinions on journalistic ethics, how to earn and keep readers’ trust, and the journalists’ vexed obligations to the truth in an industry where models of “access journalism” routinely incentivize them to have close – even cozy – relationships with those they cover. Nuzzi, in particular, has a talent for getting incendiary and controversial figures on the right to say things that they probably shouldn’t, and media watchers have long speculated that this might be because of her own conservative leanings: that she is able to ingratiate herself to rightwing subjects because she is able to convince them that she offers a sympathetic ear. In that much, at least, any honest journalist will have to admit that Nuzzi is not alone. But she seems to have taken her sympathy for her subjects far beyond the industry baseline. Not everyone finds Nuzzi’s conduct objectionable on journalistic grounds. Ben Smith, the former New York Times media columnist who now runs the outlet Semafor, used his newsletter to ask what all the fuss was about. He claimed that British journalists had texted him to the effect of: “If you’re not sleeping with someone in a position of power, how are you even a journalist?” The NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik characterizes this statement from Smith as “bananas”. We might also add that it is insulting to Smith’s colleagues, be they American, British or anything else – and in particular, to the women. It implies that there are large numbers of female journalists trading sex for access. There are not. It is rare, and more than frowned upon, for journalists to sleep with their sources or subjects: doing so compromises the integrity of the work. And most female journalists, like most female professionals in any field, are not interested in trading on their sexuality for professional advancement. And yet Smith’s defense of Nuzzi was not the only comment that seemed to take a kind of prurient delight in the story. Almost immediately, RFK Jr sympathizers started leaking stories to the media that seemed aimed at minimizing his own role in the relationship and portraying Nuzzi as a sex-starved obsessive, who “bombarded” the Kennedy scion against his will with “increasingly pornographic photos and videos that he found difficult to resist”, in the words of Jessica Reed Kraus. Sure. Other outlets, eager to credulously repeat these claims, took a similar track. The New York Post ran a story to this effect that featured an image of Nuzzi in a bikini. Another journalist, Keith Olbermann, chimed in with the irrelevant and unhelpful information that he also dated Nuzzi once, back when he was in his mid-50s and she was in her early 20s. The Daily Beast went to far as to publish a gross fictionalization of Nuzzi and RFK Jr’s correspondence. The schadenfreude has changed its tenor: from delight in the revealed hypocrisies of the powerful to delight in the sexual humiliation of a woman. It is assumed that it is Nuzzi’s sexuality itself – rather than her decision to direct it toward a subject of her reporting – that disqualifies her from public dignity. Let’s be clear: Nuzzi is not a victim. There is no indication that her relationship with RFK Jr was anything but consensual, however distasteful we may find it. Nor does she appear to be a woman of robust feminist commitments. Not only has Nuzzi routinely cozied up to powerful Republican political players, but until recently she was engaged to the Politico writer Ryan Lizza, who was fired from the New Yorker in 2017 for alleged sexual misconduct. The misogyny directed against her, then, raises an uncomfortable question for feminists: how do we criticize the actions of patriarchal women without falling into the trap of perpetuating misogyny against them? The most ungenerous interpretation of Nuzzi’s career – which is not necessarily the most likely one – is that she used her youth and good looks to her advantage, flattering the egos of men who could get her jobs or serve as sources. In this scenario, she would have made a trade-off – sexual attention for professional opportunity. There is a tendency to demonize this kind of use of sexuality by women (and a less pronounced, usually tardy tendency to criticize such trades when they are demanded or accepted by men). It is this tendency, feeding off the unspoken and unproven assumptions about just what Nuzzi and RFK Jr were offering each other, that has led to all the slut-shaming of Nuzzi in the media. Women who make such trades are not necessarily unequipped for the jobs they get by them: talent and corruption often coexist in one person. (And whatever the controversies and uncertainties about Nuzzi herself, there is no dispute that she is very talented.) But the problem with such transactions, where they do happen, is not that the women who make them are sluts. It is that they are scabs. Such trade-offs can be consensual, but they can never really be ethical: they make it harder for other women in their industries who are not willing or able to use their sexuality to advance to do so; they set the precedent that sex for opportunity is an acceptable trade to make to female workers; they encourage men to leverage their professional power to extract sexual favors. They cast all female professionals under the suspicion of corruptibility and unseriousness. Whatever Nuzzi was doing, she doesn’t seem to have been thinking much about her female colleagues; she appears to have mostly been thinking about herself. But she’s not the only one in this scenario who deserves our attention. Spare a thought for the other women working in journalism – including many of Nuzzi’s colleagues at New York Magazine – who will now be embarrassed by unfair comparisons to her. If there’s a victim in this story, it’s them. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

          "headline": "Baggy jeans are back, and the barrel-leg is the grown-up way to do them",
          "bodyText": "I probably shouldn’t say this, what with fashion literally being my job, but the honest-to-god truth is that you can safely ignore about 98% of fashion trends and it won’t make you any less fashionable. A sea change in how we dress only comes around every so often. Most of what the fashion industry calls trends are just the surface ripples that happen between these big waves. Sheer skirts, mesh shoes, cowboy hats, that kind of thing. You can ignore pretty much everything else that has happened in fashion this year, except for one thing, which is that your jeans can’t be tight any more. A jean with a looser leg shape is the one change you need to have made to your wardrobe. OK, OK! Obviously I do realise this isn’t an essential in the literal sense. But it is essential if you want to be in the world looking and feeling like you know what year it is. And, since you are reading this, I rather think that you do. But how big your jeans need to be is the main question. They don’t have to be as dramatic as the pair pictured here, at least not yet, so please don’t panic. The only non-negotiable is that you need to feel space between flesh and denim, from the hem at least up to mid-thigh. So the switch can be as low-key as swapping sausage-skin skinnies for a straight-leg jean, to start off with. But once you get used to the way a loose-leg jean feels on your body and looks in the mirror, you may be ready to take things to the next level. There are three ways to go. The first is baggy all over, the second option is flared, and the third way is a barrel or horseshoe shape, which is what you can see here. Today – as you may have guessed from the photo – I’m putting forward the case for the barrel-leg. Here’s why. Baggy-all-over jeans are, style-wise, arguably the most on-point, judging by the fact that this is the shape young people are mostly wearing. But the vibe of a big old baggy jean is deliberately scruffy. The way the hem drags along the pavement? That’s intentional. Youngsters dress like this because they want us to clutch our pearls. I know age-appropriateness is not supposed to be a style concept any more, but I do think scruffy is hard to do with charm north of 40. So the big old baggy jean? I’m sitting that one out. Flares are tricky, now that jeans are bigger all over. A boot-cut or a kick flare was a manageable, bitesize way to do a flare when jeans were tighter. But if the top half of a jean is already loose, the flare gets enormous. To make baggy flares work, you need to lean into glamour: a high-waisted flared jean with a stretchy knit top and a platform sandal, say. Fabulous. But not the easy-to-pull-on look most of us want from our denim. The barrel-leg jean, or horseshoe jean, balloons outward in a harem-pant silhouette, and tapers to a neat ankle. The ones you can see here are the Luna style by Agolde, in recycled denim, with a straight front seam that emphasises the crescent-moon silhouette of the leg. Whistles is a good place to head for sophisticated, easy-to-wear takes on this shape: I really like its authentic barrel-leg jean (£95), which is made in non-stretch denim – that’s the “authentic” part – meaning they keep their shape much better. Stretch jeans are great if you want them to mould to your shape, but if you want them to keep their own silhouette, go for non-stretch. Free People’s We the Free Good Luck Mid-Rise Barrel Jean (£88-£98) comes in every colour from pistachio to tie-dye bubble-gum pink. The shape is … let’s go with eye‑catching, shall we? Not silly but bold. It might feel intimidating, but it is an efficient way of dressing, style-wise, because with a pair of jeans in this shape, your look doesn’t need much else. A close-fitting top that you can tuck in, and some simple shoes with a low profile – a ballerina flat works just as well as a pointy court – are more than enough. These jeans are the only dose of fashion you need. Stylist’s assistant: Sam Deaman. Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Sam McKnight and Nudestix. Model: Maria Diniz at Milk.

          "headline": "‘We always felt safer here’: Tel Aviv unmoved by Hezbollah missile attack",
          "bodyText": "Air raid sirens blared in Tel Aviv on Wednesday morning as, for the first time, Hezbollah fired a surface-to-surface missile at the coastal city. A few minutes after the incident, beachgoers flooded the bustling promenade, playing beach volley, cycling and kite surfing. “Was there an attack this morning?” asked Eyal Kadosh, 31, confused, while resting on a bench with a friend after their daily workout. “Well, I’m here, what should happen will happen anyway.” Despite the looming prospect of an all-out conflict with Hezbollah, as an intense bombing campaign inside Lebanon stretched into a fourth day, the lives of Tel Avivians seem unaffected, consumed by a sense of near invulnerability. The unprecedented attack did not appear to burst what is sometimes seen as the city’s bubble while conflict rages elsewhere. “I went to the shelter as soon as I heard the air siren, but I’m not afraid,” said Ravit, a 28-year-old teacher, on the promenade. “I think the Hezbollah threat is like others we have faced before. But I believe in our army, and as long as they tell me I can go to the beach, I will go to the beach.” Tel Aviv, known to some in Israel as “the state of Tel Aviv”, with its luxury hotels and restaurants and its vibrant nightlife, has a reputation as a place to escape the Israel-Palestinian crisis. When the city hosted the Eurovision song contest in 2019, against a backdrop of a three-day conflict that claimed the lives of 23 Palestinians and four Israelis in the southern region, contestants never skipped a beat. “We are used to life under these threats,” said Jonatan, 28, “Last night I went out and I knew that some rockets might come, but I thought: what’s the difference if I stay at home?” “Part of it is also geography,” said Yoni, 33. “Being at centre, far from the threats from the south in Gaza and far from the north with Hezbollah in Lebanon, we always felt relatively safer here.” Tel Aviv, boasting the country’s stock exchange, a high concentration of tech enterprises and esteemed cultural establishments, has always stood as a stronghold for Israeli liberals. In the aftermath of Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October last year, in which 1,200 people died and about 250 were kidnapped, the city became the “capital of hostages” as protesters flooded its streets daily to demand a deal for the return of those held captive in Gaza. Demonstrators blocked roads, lit fires and clashed with police, who often used water cannon to disperse the crowds. For months, Tel Aviv was the most vibrant political voice across the country. Every day, thousands assembled in a bustling public plaza outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art known as Hostages Square, where a Shabbat table was set up surrounded by about 200 vacant chairs symbolising those who had been captured. Hundreds of people queued at stands selling T-shirts, flags and merchandise bearing the rallying cry “Bring them home NOW”. Then, slowly, the mood changed. On Wednesday evening, Hostages Square was desolately empty. Despite protesters continuing to gather in the plaza at weekends, few believe in the sudden return of the hostages. As the anniversary approaches of the attack that triggered a war that has disrupted the lives of millions, hope for a deal between Hamas and the Israeli government seems to have almost entirely vanished from the media. The protest lived on as dozens of young women and men gathered near the exit of an underpass next to the IDF headquarters in downtown Tel Aviv, blocking hundreds of vehicles while silently displaying photos of the hostages. Meanwhile, Yigal, a 35-year-old lawyer, sat in the nearly deserted square bar surrounded by vacant tables. “Until a few months ago, people here in Tel Aviv still had hope to put pressure on the government, but things have changed,” he said. “Today we have even stopped talking about Gaza, and Lebanon is almost the only topic of discussion.” Yonathan, 35, said: “We are under threat from different fronts. As much as the hostage deal is crucial, I feel like the priorities have changed in this country.”"

          "bodyText": "No iron law of politics says a government cannot recover from a bad early stumble. So don’t write Keir Starmer off too quickly because of the long game he insists on playing or the freebies he took. But don’t kid yourself that his government is not wounded either. Because, after only three months in power, it has already felt a brush with mortality. The Labour conference in Liverpool has made little difference to this. Party conferences can seem absorbing when you are present. But their wider importance is overstated. The same goes for leaders’ speeches. Most people living outside the bubble barely notice them, and they didn’t care that much in the first place anyway. In Tuesday’s speech, Starmer showed he could see this, but also that he doesn’t possess the tools to change it. He acknowledged the indisputable, that the public mood towards politics and government has changed in modern times: “brittle and fragile” were his chosen words. When ministers ask for “patience in pursuit of national renewal”, people wonder what there will be to show for it. “I understand that,” said Starmer. What followed showed the limits of his understanding. The speech relied on a reiteration of familiar assertions that ought, in theory, to inspire but do not, and have triggered Starmer’s recent lurching poll ratings. That politics can make a difference. That Labour’s is a long-term project, requiring patience. That the project is not easy. That, in the words of the speech, “It all comes back to that question: can politics be a force for good in people’s lives?” That is indeed a big question, one of the biggest. But the decline in public confidence towards politics has gone further and faster than the politicians’ responses. Three months in, Starmer’s homilies, worthy and well-intentioned, do not supply an adequate answer. Recent polls underline this. They confirm instead that no response is worth anything if it fails to grasp how much of the public no longer has confidence in politicians and government. To underestimate this is to doom oneself to failure and disappointment. Confronting this problem is Starmer’s central challenge – and perhaps also our country’s. But Labour’s answer is too tepid. After the Conservatives imploded in autumn 2022, it was always obvious Labour would win the next election. Preparation for government was intense. Shadow ministers were briefed for months. Few incoming governments could have been more ready for the task than Starmer’s. So how come they didn’t see this month’s freebie row coming until it hit them in the face? It wasn’t as if the scandal was about anything new. Quite the opposite. MPs’ dubious expense claims and ministerial sleaze have tainted British politics for decades. Surely there was someone in Downing Street or in Starmer’s office who saw in advance that ministers accepting cash from donors for clothes, rentals, holidays and tickets was an awful look, especially post-Boris Johnson? Why did no one say “Just say no”? Was there no one who grasped that saying yes to freebies is a prime example of exactly what leads so many to conclude that all politicians are the same – and that all politicians are in it for themselves? In the campaigning part of its brain, Labour knows this. It is why the party put the issue front and centre in its election manifesto at the start of the summer. There was a crisis of confidence in politics, the document said. Labour would, therefore, govern differently. It would restore confidence. No ifs, no buts. Did ministers simply not bother to read these words? How does that square with free tickets and clothes? To which the answer is that too many in Labour have awarded themselves a free pass. Some of this is fed by the suspicion, expressed by several ministers, that a hostile Whitehall establishment is behind the leaks. Most, though, is explained – though not excused – by the Labour belief, clearly widespread, that they are financially underprivileged compared with the Tories (not invariably true, by the way) and thus morally entitled to be judged by a lower standard. Labour’s blind spot about its own virtue is deep in its culture. Remember “pretty straight sort of guy”, anyone? What the past two weeks should tell Starmer is that he can never afford to be so insouciant about such matters again. Starmer said nothing in his speech to confront the issue. But Labour is kidding itself if it thinks the impact of the freebie rows has receded. It is far more likely that the damage inflicted by the freebies will outlast the optimism at which party loyalists clutched in Liverpool. For starters, Starmer needs to appoint someone to his inner circle whom he trusts to tell him when he is digging a hole for himself. Experience suggests this is not Sue Gray. If he had had such a person already, he would not have got into the freebie hole and then tried to defend himself in the feeble manner he still adopted on the Today programme this week over the central London accommodation supplied to him by Lord Alli. But he also needs to send a clear and more insistent message about Labour’s project. A stronger No 10 team and a more aggressive communications operation are parts of this. But only parts. A much more significant part is to be personally proactive on the issue itself: to cap donations and gifts to ministers and to put them all into an independently operated body such as a blind trust to which genuinely needy ministers can apply if appropriate, up to a modest ceiling. But the bigger key is to do what I warned on these pages on the eve of the election needed to be done. Starmer needs to ensure that he, his staff and his ministers all absorb the Nolan principles of public life into their every waking act. This has not happened, with the consequences we have seen. It is a disgrace that there is not yet an updated ministerial code in place. When that is rectified, Starmer must make the code tough, transparent and independently enforced. This government’s wider political credibility rests, to a degree it may not appreciate, on a collective ability to maintain and enforce a regime of demonstrable modesty and frugality. Without such an approach, Labour is one sleaze scandal away from a slide into a disrepute with a doubting public that would make even the most virtuous project unachievable.

          "headline": "Money by David McWilliams review – the story of cold hard cash",
          "bodyText": "Money – or the lack of it – was central to the Victorian novel. Think of Mr Micawber in David Copperfield banged up in a debtors’ prison waiting for something to turn up. Or Augustus Melmotte, the crooked financier in Trollope’s The Way We Live Now. Plots invariably involved wills, the dowry of an heiress, or the collapse of get-rich-quick Ponzi schemes. They knew how to keep the reader gripped back then. Popular nonfiction books about money, by contrast, are something of a rarity. John Maynard Keynes’s masterwork – The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money – is like James Joyce’s Ulysses: a book finished by only a small percentage of those who start it. Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations falls into the same category. As, more recently, does Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century, an unexpected bestseller. Economics books are rarely page turners, in large part because most economists aren’t exactly stylists. So all credit to David McWilliams for his attempt to tell the history of the world – all the way from 18,000BC to the present – through the medium of money. The author makes a bold claim: that the story of money is the story of humanity itself. Writing, he says, “came about because of another groundbreaking technology: money. Money was the first thing we wrote about.” The argument doesn’t altogether convince, but McWilliams, a former economist at the Central Bank of Ireland, does know how to write. His book is well researched and crammed full of anecdotes that help bring a dry subject to life. Some are familiar enough. No book about money would be complete without a mention of Dutch tulip mania in the 1630s or the South Sea Bubble of 1720. Other stories will be more surprising, for example the fact that Darwin’s theory of evolution was inspired not by a biological treatise, but an economic one – Thomas Malthus’s work on population. It was also news to me that The Wizard of Oz could be seen as an allegory for the struggle between the populists of the American heartlands and the east-coast financial elites in the 1890s. Hitler’s planned attempt to destroy the British economy through airdrops of counterfeit banknotes crafted by inmates of concentration camps is well told. From King Midas and his golden touch to Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press, the narrative zips along at a fair old pace, even though some of the historical references are a bit contrived. There is a long section about the trial and execution of Sir Roger Casement – hanged for treason during the first world war – the relevance of which is not immediately obvious. Joyce’s role in establishing Dublin’s first cinema also seems an unnecessary digression from the book’s central theme. There are other – slightly nit-picking – criticisms. An interesting passage about the modernist revolution in art and literature could have been expanded to include more than a cursory nod to the modernist revolution in economics pioneered by Keynes in the 1930s. The section on how commercial banks create money will be tough going for the lay reader, and is out of character compared with the light touch in the rest of the book. The early chapters – which take in a credit crunch in Imperial Rome and the challenge posed to the Catholic church by the merchants of Florence around the time of the Black Death – feel fresher than the boilerplate accounts of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the advent of bitcoin. As the book progresses, the strain of keeping up a mono-causal explanation of how the modern world has evolved starts to show. That said, there is much to enjoy – for the lay reader as well as the economist. The book’s flaws are comfortably outweighed by its strengths: not least the fact that McWilliams clearly had a lot of fun writing it. • Money: A Story of Humanity is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£25).

          "headline": "How to make the perfect flan (or French custard tart) – recipe",
          "bodyText": "Flan: not the cheese-and-tomato traybake served up for British school dinners or the Latin American creme caramel, but the magnificent custard tart that stands proud on so many French bakery counters. I have become mildly obsessed with flans, for their unapologetic plainness, for the sturdiness of the starch-thickened filling (which is so different from the more delicate, nutmeg-flecked British custard tart) and, mostly, for the fact that they sanction the consumption of what is, essentially, a wedge of solid custard. Flan is sometimes sold as flan pâtissier, sometimes as flan parisien and occasionally as a far breton (though, as far as I can tell, the latter tends to contain fruit). Pastry chef and Paris resident David Lebovitz explains that there “are a lot of variations on the name and the way it’s baked, so I just go into a bakery and order it by whatever name they decide to give it. (Rule #1: avoid arguing with people serving you food.)” Rule #2: flan may not be the flashiest pastry on offer at most patisseries, but it will be the one you wake up in the middle of the night two weeks later desperate to recreate. Here’s how. The pastry Rolling-pin phobes and coeliacs will be delighted to learn that one can dispense with the pastry altogether, and with it the pretence that a flan is about anything other than custard – though, as Lebovitz observes, “the crust certainly makes the dessert more dramatic”. Master patissier Christophe Michalak apparently believes a crustless flan is lighter and more digestible; I’m no nutritionist, but I can confirm it’s an awful lot quicker and easier to prepare. That said, eliminating the pastry means no pleasurable contrast between crisp crust and soft filling, so though you can, by all means, bake the custard in a well-buttered baking dish, it won’t be quite the same. If you don’t do gluten but do like pastry, note that pastry chef Brian Levy links to his gluten-free version in his piece for Nicola Lamb’s Kitchen Projects Substack. You could, of course, save time by buying your pastry readymade, though I wouldn’t recommend using puff; I try that in the Atelier des Chefs flan, and my testers and I find the flakiness a less enjoyable textural pairing than snappier, shorter crusts, particularly given the importance of leaving the custard to cool completely before serving, which gives those airy layers ample time to sink and soften. I test a couple of rich, sweet recipes, too, one, from baker and author Richard Bertinet’s book Pastry, with half as much butter and sugar as flour, and two eggs plus an extra yolk, which is delicious but very delicate. The other is a slightly less buttery version using icing sugar and ground almonds from Nicola Lamb, which is easier to work with and has a gorgeous flavour. The most popular, however, is Edd Kimber’s savoury shortcrust, from his Boy Who Bakes substack, that’s hydrated with water rather than egg, which makes it incredibly crunchy – and anyway, one might conclude there’s enough egg in the filling not to miss it in the crust. Though many more adept than I believe that there’s little point in blind baking pastry before pouring in such a wet filling, I agree with Kimber that skipping this step results in “underbaked, pale pastry … the [base] doesn’t get the chance to brown properly and … will inevitably take on a little moisture from the custard, this results in an insipid pastry that is a bit pasty. Now, many bakeries bake their flan using this method, and I know there are people that actually like their pastry like this, but for me I want the pastry well baked, golden and with some crispness.” Me, too, Edd, me, too. In fact, I’m going to brush the pastry with the egg whites left over from the custard as extra insurance against sogginess. I also like Kimber’s tin-lining technique, which is new to me, but which also pops up in Lamb’s new book Sift. This involves separately lining the sides and base of the pan, which, though it sounds fiddly, is actually far more practical when you’re working with a deep tin. The custard Let’s be honest, this is all that most people care about here. Note that flan is not made with a purely egg-thickened custard, but a creme patissier thickened by both eggs and starch, which puts it somewhere between creme anglaise and my beloved Bird’s. This means that the delicate, silky wobble of a creme caramel is not the aim here; a flan must be robust enough to be self-supporting, even when sliced, and a certain flexibility – or rubberiness, if I’m being completely honest – is also desirable, so embrace it. That custard can be made with milk alone (whole milk, please), as in the Atelier des Chefs recipe, or with a proportion of cream as well. Many French recipes call for crème liquide, which has a fat content more consistent with our own whipping cream or American heavy cream than with the double cream used by Kimber (30-35% as opposed to 48%). The more fat you add to the creme pat, be it in the form of dairy or egg yolk, the softer and richer the custard will be, while the more egg white you include, the firmer and more jelly-like its texture and the milder the flavour. As I want this to have more body than a set custard, I’m going to use an equal number of whole eggs to yolks, as Kimber and Bertinet suggest, rather than yolks alone (Michalak); the Atelier des Chefs flan, made with only whole eggs, is a little too light for my liking. I’ve tended towards Levy’s modest ratio of milk to cream, however, rather than the equal parts suggested by Bertinet – though I’m never one to be swayed by aesthetics over taste, the visual appeal of a substantial wedge of flan cannot be underplayed, which means it shouldn’t be so heavy as to require wafer-thin portions. No one wants a slender slice of flan. For the same reason, I won’t be enriching the custard with Kimber’s knob of butter, but feel free to disagree. And note that I’ve used double cream, because it’s easier for me to get good-quality stuff than it is with whipping cream; you could always substitute the latter and adjust the proportions slightly. Cornflour is the patissier’s thickener of choice, which is handy, because it also happens to be gluten-free, though Atelier des Chefs uses equal parts wheat and corn flour. Wheat flour is supposed to make the custard more stable, but I don’t find separation a problem with any of the recipes I try – plus, the less flour, the silkier the consistency. Make sure you let the custard simmer for at least 30 seconds before taking it off the heat, stirring all the time, or it won’t set properly – the starch gelatinises and thickens the mixture at about 79C, but amylase, an enzyme in the egg yolks, will break it down again if it’s not deactivated by bringing the custard to just below a full boil and holding it there. Don’t worry, the starch also means the custard mix is unlikely to scramble, but do keep stirring to prevent it burning. Vanilla is the classic choice of flavouring here, with most recipes infusing the dairy before use (Levy calls for up to three pods, which makes his flan so luxuriantly speckled with seeds that they crunch in the mouth, but you could always use less expensive vanilla extract if you prefer). Michalak doesn’t add any extra flavourings, and indeed there’s no need given how nice sugared cream is on its own. Or experiment with alternatives: Kristina Razon mentions lemon and chocolate versions in her piece for Serious Eats, for example. The tin and the bake time As previously mentioned, this is essentially a custard rather than a pastry dish, which dictates a fairly deep mould. But it’s also a dish with a liquid filling, which means that, even if you blind bake the pastry, I would caution against using a loose-bottomed tin. Even though Kimber’s version in a springform pan (which I wrap in foil and place in a shallow bowl, just in case) works out fine, I’m loth to recommend taking the risk, especially with such expensive ingredients. Given that solid pie tins are available only in slightly larger sizes (I find them from 20cm up, and buy one described as a tarte tatin dish), I suggest making a large flan; it will keep well for a few days and in my experience is easy to give away if you can’t manage the whole thing. I’m blind baking the pastry, so I’ve kept the baking temperature fairly low to guard against scorching its edges. This adds to the time in the oven, but the results are worth it. If you’d like your flan to have the gorgeously browned top boasted by Levy’s version, feel free to turn the temperature up right at the end to help things along, but I think it looks pretty irresistible as is. Perfect flan Prep 15 min Infuse 1 hr Chill 1 hr 30 min+ Cook 1 hr 20 min For the pastry (or use 300g ready-made all-butter shortcrust; optional) 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tbsp icing sugar ¼-½ tsp fine salt 105g cold butter, diced For the custard filling 750ml whole milk 150ml double cream 1-2 vanilla pods, depending on taste and budget 4 eggs plus 2 egg yolks 80g cornflour 150g caster sugar If you’re making your own pastry, start with that. Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then rub in the butter, or whizz it in a food processor – stop as soon as you can see no large pieces of butter. Stir in just enough water (you’ll need about two tablespoons) to bring the mix together into a smooth dough, then divide in half, and shape one half into a flat disc and the other into a flat rectangle. Wrap each piece of pastry individually, then chill for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put the milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Slit open the vanilla pod(s) lengthways, then scrape out the seeds. Put the seeds and pod(s) in the milk pan and bring slowly to just below a simmer, stirring occasionally. Take off the heat, cover and leave to infuse for about an hour. Grease a 20cm solid deep pie dish (mine is 5cm tall). Roll out the pastry rectangle on a lightly floured surface to make a rectangle 1cm or so wider than your dish is deep and a little longer than the dish’s diameter. Trim the edges, then cut into two equal rectangular strips and use these to line the sides of the dish, pressing the join in the middle firmly until you can’t see it. Roll out the round piece of pastry, then use the base of the pie dish to help you cut out a neat round. Separate one of the whole eggs and, keeping the yolk aside, whisk the white until frothy. Paint this all over the pastry in the tin. Now lift in the base piece and press firmly to stick it down, so you can’t see the join. Cover and chill for at least an hour. Bring the vanilla-infused milk back to a simmer. Meanwhile, put the reserved egg yolk in a large heatproof bowl with the other two egg yolks, then add the three remaining whole eggs and anchor the bowl to the surface with a damp cloth. Put the cornflour in a small bowl, whisk in a little of the egg mix until smooth, then whisk this back into the egg mix, followed by the sugar. Fish out the vanilla pod(s) – I wash them, dry them and use them to infuse sugar – then pour a little of the hot milk on to the eggs, whisking as you do so. Once thoroughly combined, whisk in the rest of the hot milk. Pour the lot back into the pan and bring back to a simmer, stirring continuously. As soon as the mix begins to bubble (you can stop stirring briefly to check this), stir for 30 seconds more, then take off the heat and leave to cool (I put the bowl in a sink of cold water to speed this up), stirring occasionally to stop a skin forming. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and, once it comes to temperature, line the pastry case with baking paper (scrunch it up first so it sits more easily) and baking or dry beans, or rice. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove, take out the beans and paper, brush the pastry with a thin layer of more egg white, then return the pastry case to the oven for another 10 minutes, until the base is golden. Remove and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4, and give the case 10 minutes or so to cool down. Whisk the custard to bring it back together, or, for a really smooth custard, whizz it with a hand blender, then pour it into the shell, making sure you leave at least 1cm of pastry showing at the top. Carefully lift it into the oven and bake on a lower shelf for about an hour, until set but still with a wobble on top. Remove and leave to cool completely before slicing and serving. Flan: why is this French bakery classic so underrated? Do you like it plain or flavoured; soft or solid; with a flaky or crunchy crust; or with no crust at all? And where serves the best version?"

          "headline": "Top Chinese economist disappears after criticising Xi Jinping in private chat – report",
          "bodyText": "A leading Chinese economist at a government thinktank has reportedly disappeared after being disciplined for criticising Xi Jinping in a private chat group. Zhu Hengpeng, 55, is believed to have made disparaging remarks about China’s economy, and potentially about the Chinese leader specifically, in a private WeChat group. Zhu was subsequently detained in April and put under investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal which cited anonymous sources. Zhu worked for the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass) for more than 20 years, most recently as the Institute of Economics deputy director and director of the Public Policy Research Center. He has reportedly not been seen in public since April when he spoke at an event organised by Chinese media outlet Caixin, which he had done previously. Efforts by the Wall Street Journal to contact him at home were unsuccessful. The Cass has not responded to queries from the Guardian. Earlier this month Hong Kong media reported a shakeup of the institute’s senior ranks, with the director and secretary also removed from their posts at the same time Zhu was stripped of his role. The other two officials were reassigned, according to Sing Tao Daily, but Zhu was not, and is no longer listed on the Cass website. Websites related to his work at Tsinghua University have also been taken offline, although the Guardian could not confirm when. The Cass is a leading thinktank in China, which reports directly to the cabinet of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), the State Council, and has long been an influential policy advisor, sometimes providing relatively frank analysis. However under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Xi, criticism of the CCP and his individual leadership has become increasingly frowned upon, and treated punitively. China-based academics have previously told the Guardian of a growing fear among their profession of reporting or discussing negative assessments of China’s economic, social, or political situation for fear of reprisals. Discussion of Xi as an individual, especially in online spaces which are censored and monitored, is largely avoided or done through vague or coded statements. Notices on the Cass website show staff engaging in several political education sessions in recent months, with a heavy focus on party loyalty and adherence to Xi Jinping Thought – the name given to the enshrined political ideology of the CCP leader. “The meeting emphasised that we must always bear in mind that the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is a political institution whose work is centred on scientific research, put strict enforcement of the party’s political discipline first, work hard to enforce strict discipline and abide by rules,” said a report on one July meeting, led by Cass president Gao Xiang. Gao, a Xi loyalist, was appointed to the role in 2022 and has overseen a campaign to improve party loyalty at the institution. The specifics of what Zhu wrote in the private WeChat group are not known, although Sing Tao Daily described it as “improperly discussed central policies”. The Wall Street Journal also reported he allegedly made a reference to “Xi’s mortality”. China’s economy is struggling, and there are concerns that the world’s second-largest economy will miss its own 5% annual growth target, a relatively modest ambition by historic standards. On Tuesday the country’s central bank announced the biggest stimulus efforts in years in a bid to boost growth, but experts expressed concern the measures, including a cut in interest rates, would not be sufficient. A growing crisis in China’s property market has unfolded since authorities cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers, leading many to default on their debts. Property developers and owners continue to cope with high mortgage payments, dragging on their ability to invest and grow. Regulators have avoided making large-scale cuts to borrowing costs, fearing that the stimulus would reignite a boom in sales and values, creating a fresh property bubble.

          "headline": "Ballet star Joseph Sissens: ‘I’d be in this world of gross privilege, and then I’d go visit my brother in prison’",
          "bodyText": "I used to be really apologetic, like, I’m sorry for breathing, for being here, shall I go in the corner … ” says Joseph Sissens, acting flustered and describing himself as a young dancer when he first joined the Royal Ballet. But over the last eight years, the change has been dramatic. Now, he says, “this weird animal has kind of come out on stage”. He talks about creating Wayne McGregor’s piece Untitled 2023, being in “a state of complete and utter instinct. Weird stuff just comes out. I can be my oddness.” There was a duet with the dancer Leo Dixon, where Sissens was imagining what would happen if he were an alien falling in love with a human. “Leo’s arm was just there, and randomly in a rehearsal I just bit him,” he giggles and mimes nuzzling and chomping on a forearm. It was a move that made it into the final piece. In this wide-smiling 26-year-old, sitting backstage at the Royal Opera House laughing and effusively telling stories with his whole body, there’s little trace of the shy boy Sissens describes to me, a child of few words who would watch his sister’s ballet class through the hatch from the kitchen of a church hall and dance along. The teacher soon clocked him and asked him to join them, and when he started dancing, he says, “the personality just fell out, and it was like: Well, this is Joe. Joe is a dancer.” He certainly is and, newly promoted to principal dancer at the Royal Ballet, he’s one of the best in the country. Sissens is one of those performers who is very visible, always seeming to be chosen for new creations and by visiting choreographers – this season he’s in McGregor’s new piece MaddAddam, based on Margaret Atwood’s novels, and is a standout in Crystal Pite’s The Statement. He’s demonstrated his fine classical line and perfectly balletic feet as Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake and other leading roles, but is one of the most convincing dancers in more modern styles too, such as the hip-hop-influenced work of Joseph Toonga. Sissens has also been visible as an articulate, switched-on person, gently pushing at, and overtly challenging, some of the underlying racism that has been long embedded in ballet culture and institutions. The reason we’re chatting today is because Sissens (whose heritage is Anglo-Jamaican) is co-creating an event called Legacy at the Royal Opera House in London, a gala performance “celebrating Black and Brown excellence”. He had the idea a few years back and took it to the Royal Ballet’s artistic director, Kevin O’Hare, and now here he is putting together the final programme with guests from major UK and international companies, including New York’s Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, all dancing excerpts from the classical rep plus two new short commissions. “I call it a kaleidoscope of love,” says Sissens. He describes inviting the kind of dancers who, “when I’m having a hard day, are the people whose clips I go and watch to be inspired. If you have little microaggressions during the day and then you look at a clip of, say, Nikisha Fogo [from San Francisco Ballet] doing her absolute best, it reminds you: ‘OK, keep going. She can do this, I can do this.’” In Legacy, Sissens wants to create an event where the dancers can come and put down “some of the baggage, some of the bricks they might be carrying, and just relax for a second and be themselves”. That means things like making sure there’s someone who can work with afro hair, for example, and who can braid and deal with dreadlocks. Historically, hair that doesn’t conform to slick/straight European norms has often been seen as “difficult” or “inappropriate” in ballet, but in recent years Sissens has been changing expectations, wearing his hair in braids or locs on stage. And when he danced the Prince in The Nutcracker, who always wears a silver wig, a wig was made for him with cornrows. It’s a small but seismic change. “I’m not, like, blowing up ballet,” he says. “I’m just saying you have to understand its roots” – in the 17th- and 18th-century European courts – “and what that means for the people within it now, in order to contextualise it.” Sissens didn’t set out to be an activist but, as he puts it: “I’m one of six dancers of colour in the Royal Ballet. If no one else is going to do it, it has to be me.” When he came back to work after the Covid lockdowns, and after the murder of George Floyd, he was angry. “The anger was kind of consuming me,” he says, but that later turned into resolve, to speak out and to make change in his corner of the world. He’s spoken honestly in public discussions at the Royal Opera House (“I’ve definitely spilled my guts”) but with Legacy, he says, the tone is celebratory. “No trauma, yeah. My blackness isn’t just pain, it’s beauty.” Especially now he’s a principal, he feels a responsibility to look out for younger dancers of colour coming up in the industry. There’s a moving moment in one of those public events, which you can watch online, where he addresses the young dancer Marianna Tsembenhoi: “You see someone with a similar experience and you take care of them” he tells her. “Our community is so beautiful. We got you.” It can be a rarefied world, the upper echelons of an institution such as the Royal Ballet, but it’s clear Sissens hasn’t lived in a ballet bubble. “Dance is my safe place,” he says, discovered when he was living with his mum and four siblings in a village in Hertfordshire. At eight his talent was spotted and he was offered a scholarship to Tring Park performing arts school. He lived between two worlds. Home was a council house, while the school was based in a mansion formerly owned by the Rothschild banking family, which Sissens describes as like being at Hogwarts, complete with secret doors into the library. “I’d be in this world of gross privilege, and then on a weekend I’d visit my brother in prison,” he says. “There was no middle ground: ultimate privilege or the hardships of real, real life, that being in the Harry Potter School of Dance can’t protect you from. I hadn’t got the adult brain yet in order to figure it out: ‘OK, now I’ve got a sniffer dog sniffing me. Tomorrow I’m going up to English National Ballet to be Fritz in The Nutcracker.’” He mentions that, in the future, he’d like to do something to support vulnerable children, or perhaps start a foundation for victims of domestic violence, something that has touched his life. But his focus now is very firmly on dance, where he’s soaring. What kind of dancer does he think he is? “Sensitive,” he says straight away. “Very emotional. I find it hard not to give everything. I can feel everything – it’s annoying how much I can feel things.” He finds it hard to dance unless he truly believes in what he’s doing, but when he does: “I’m the type of dancer that loves to completely and utterly embody that for three hours on stage.” And in terms of the roles he longs to dance: “I dream, dream, dream of being Romeo,” he says. You don’t doubt that wish will come true. His mum always told him he was headstrong, he tells me. If he got something in his head that he wanted, it would happen. This is a dancer who worked hard, but also knows how lucky he is to have landed here and he’s going to make the most of it. “I want to push my body as far as it goes,” he says. “I want to push my mind as far as it goes. I never want to feel like I didn’t absolutely exploit the hell out of it all,” he beams, ready to take a great big bite out of this dancing life. Legacy is at the Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, 29 to 31 October."

          "headline": "Agimat by Romalyn Ante review – spells to ward off trauma",
          "bodyText": "The hospital ward is often where the heart sinks – a place steeped in pain and unspeakable grief. However, Romalyn Ante, a Filipino-British practising nurse in the NHS, offers another side to this familiar tale. In her spellbinding meditation on love and loss, hope is less “the thing with feathers” and more the thing with forceps – prescribing metaphors like medicine from a hospital drawer. The collection starts with the heartbreaking stories of day-to-day life in a British clinic, including the chaos of Covid-19 frontlines. One woman hangs herself from a hospital rail. Later, a teenager jumps from a viaduct and another boy, certain he can never be healed, decides to drink bleach: We are salted with the knowledge of what it’s like for a life to be at stake. Ante’s medical instinct extends towards the natural world: a crimson moon becomes a blood clot whose light dissects skeletal leaves, scar-tissued soil and the “cardiac flutter” of ferns. It is a delight to diagnose the world in such a visceral way. Her poems throb vigorously with life. Yet the vision of this poet shimmers anything but clinically white. In fact, the collection blooms with a kaleidoscope of colour – often tropical in the turbulent memory of typhoons and tsunamis. Ante dwells in the bioluminescence of plankton, peregrines and patchouli, asking the unruly persistence of nature to provide an antidote to the pressures of medical life. It is a magical follow-up to her debut collection, Antiemetic for Homesickness (2020), featuring nymphs, hexes and shape-shifting rams. Mythology holds a magnificent presence as the poet’s alter ego becomes a many-breasted goddess called Mebuyan in Filipino legend. While Mebuyan nurses the spirits of departed children, Ante extends this favour to words. Throughout Agimat, language holds the power to harm – “like an arrow” that “pierces through the flesh of the afternoon”. Its violent capacity is painfully clear in the poem [In Transit], recalling the racist vitriol that spread with the virus “in a town that hasn’t learned/to love us back”. What is special here is the power that language holds to heal, like the precious “agimat” the poet keeps close. This amulet of protection is given to some Filipino children by their parents based on a mystical faith in its ability to “deflect bullets” and “unbloom wars”. The pendant becomes a prism for exploring “the magic that lives” inside language, and it is fascinating to see the mouth foam like a cauldron as “words bubble like potions”. The anaesthetic haze of mistranslation and word-slippage conjures up the most captivating promise of this collection: I will chant until every wound seals, and no child knocks, Nurse, I cut myself again Ante’s agimat is carried alongside the more abrasive gift of inherited grief for the “distant yet deafening war” that haunts her family in the wake of Japan’s wartime occupation of the Philippines. It is impossible to forget the aunt who mistakes two bombshells for rocks, sets them as a stove before limbs scatter into the trees – one hand still clutching the ladle. It might be unsettling to picture a nurse with a notebook, mythologising such memories of pain. But this project is not gratuitous. Instead, I felt grateful for the tender attention the poet affords to a hope that many of us hold dear: that as patients – that as people – we may amount to more than just flesh and bone. Thankfully, in the hands of Romalyn Ante the human self far exceeds statistics and the subtotal of all its scars. Agimat by Romalyn Ante is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£12.99).

Delivery charges may apply [Evening walk, Wednesfield] I navigate this light-pricked town; my shadow skims on pavements – rain-embossed leaves, fox-eyed alleyways. I reach the tunnel of tulle-purple fog and my thoughts flicker like the canal waters. As the hour deepens, I wonder how far this heart can listen."

          "headline": "China unleashes boldest stimulus in years to boost ailing economy",
          "bodyText": "China’s central bank has cut interest rates in an attempt to revive flagging economic growth and prevent scores of debt-laden property owners from going bust in its boldest intervention to boost the economy since the pandemic. Adopting a suite of measures to reduce borrowing costs, the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates on existing mortgages by 0.5 percentage points and supported new lending by reducing the level of reserves banks must set aside before making loans. The bank’s governor, Pan Gongsheng, said he would also ease restrictions on borrowing to invest in stocks and shares on Chinese exchanges, boosting the Shanghai composite index by more than 4% within hours of the announcement. Oil prices rose, with Brent crude up more than 1% at nearly $75 a barrel. The central bank was responding to concerns that the world’s second-largest economy will miss its own 5% annual growth target, a relatively modest ambition by historic standards. Pan did not specify when the moves would come into effect, but said up to £50bn worth of assets could be used in the stock exchange programme to support extra investment. To give the housing market a further stimulus, Pan said he would reduce the deposit needed to buy a second home from 25% to 15%. The central bank expects the combination of lower interest rates and lower deposits to help about 50m households, reducing the total interest bill by about 150bn yuan (£16bn) a year, he said. A growing crisis in China’s property market has unfolded since authorities cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers, leading many to default on their debts. Property developers and owners continue to cope with high mortgage payments, dragging on their ability to invest and grow. Regulators have avoided making large-scale cuts to borrowing costs, fearing that the stimulus would reignite a boom in sales and values, creating a fresh property bubble. “The move probably comes a bit too late, but it is better late than never,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, adding: “China needs a lower-rate environment to boost confidence.” Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said the moves represent “the most significant … stimulus package since the early days of the pandemic”, although “it may not be enough”. He added that a full economic recovery would “require more substantial fiscal support than the modest pickup in government spending that’s currently in the pipeline”. Beijing is aiming for economic growth of about 5% for 2024. However, some investment banks including Goldman Sachs, Nomura, UBS and Bank of America have recently lowered their forecasts for China’s growth rate this year. Pan said further monetary policy easing was on the cards later this year. The latest move follows a significant rate cut by the US Federal Reserve last week, which gave China the opportunity to lower its own interest rates without putting pressure on the yuan."

          "headline": "Labour conference fringe event may be turning point for racing’s fortunes",
          "bodyText": "Almost three months on from the general election campaign which swept Labour into power – and also included an unexpected rash of betting-related headlines – the new government’s ideas for regulation of the gambling industry, an issue which also has significant implications for the racing industry, remain opaque. That is likely to change on Tuesday, however, when Baroness Twycross, the minister for gambling, will be a speaker at a fringe event at the Labour conference, organised by the cross-party think-tank, the Social Market Foundation (SMF), entitled “Bad Money: the Economics of Gambling Harm”. That might not sound like a session which offers much for racing and betting to feel optimistic about. It is at least faintly possible, though, that this might one day be seen as the moment when the gambling industry’s passionate 25-year love affair with gaming products rather than traditional sports betting started to turn sour. It remains to be seen how much light Baroness Twycross will shed on the government’s immediate plans. Tuesday’s event, though, is being chaired by Dr James Noyes, a senior fellow of the SMF with a long-standing interest in gambling issues, who believes that a significant hike in in Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), the tax levied on gaming profits from products such as online slot machines, is long overdue. When you live (and gamble) in the racing bubble, it is easily overlooked, but as the veteran campaigner Brian Chappell, the founder of Justice4Punters, pointed out in a recent blog post, the rise of online slots – widely seen as one of the most potentially harmful and addictive forms of online gambling – in recent years has been extraordinary. The number of active players on online slots has more than doubled in five years, from around 2m to nearly 4.5m – around one in 10 of the adult population. Between April 2022 and March 2023, gross gambling yield (GGY) from online gaming products as a whole was £4bn, of which £3.2bn, or 80%, derived from slots. It was pointed out in this column a couple of months ago that any move to increase the tax differential between betting and gaming products would be a positive one for racing, not least because it would reduce the incentive for operators to use sports betting as a loss leader to attract new customers before pushing as many as possible towards their gaming products. Duty on betting profits is currently 15%, while the rate for gaming products is 21%. Noyes and the SMF, though, point out that many of the global gambling conglomerates that now dominate the UK market pay much higher rates to access overseas gaming markets. In a report due to be published before the budget on 30 October, it will argue that RGD should be at least 42%, ie. double the current rate. That would be a very positive development for betting and, by extension, for racing too. And while some will suggest that betting duty would soon follow suit, Noyes recently made it clear that the SMF’s focus is squarely on gaming. “Racing should be untied … from other sectors when it comes to the debate over regulation and taxation,” he said on Twitter/X. “Online slots should be limited but racing should be supported.” The principal reason that racing has become “tied” to the gaming sector in recent decades is that the multinational gambling operators, having long since swallowed up the “bookies” of yesteryear, have been busily conflating betting with gaming at every opportunity. Racing, for the most part, has stood back and watched it happen, not least during the extended scandal of £100-a-spin roulette machines in betting shops. The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), the industry’s main lobby group, is also keen to blur the boundaries. The clue, as they say, is in the name, and it seems safe to predict that its response to the SMF’s proposal when it is published next month will be volcanic. But the BGC’s attempt to ride two horses at once may finally be running out of road. Racing’s fortunes are closely tied to betting, not gaming, and if influential critics of online slots like the SMF are keen to untie one from the other, it is very much in the sport’s long-term interests to stop spectating and actively lend its support."

Then it occurred to me that, along with black beans (for plant points) and mozzarella (for melt), it would also make the perfect quesadilla filling, and was happily proved right. If you have leftover roast chicken from the weekend, this is a lovely way to use it up; if not, I’ve included a quick 15-minute poached chicken method.

Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to just below a simmer – you want just the odd bubble breaking the surface – and poach the chicken for 15 minutes, until cooked through. Meanwhile, mix the coriander leaves, grated lime zest and the juice, mayonnaise, yoghurt, mozzarella and black beans in a bowl and set aside. In another bowl, make the salad: whisk the lime juice, extra-virgin olive oil and one teaspoon sea salt, then stir in the grated carrot and beetroot. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, then set aside. Drain the cooked chicken and discard the coriander stems and lime zest. Finely chop the chicken and add it to the black-bean mix. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, then divide equally between the wraps and fold them neatly in half. Brush the outsides of the wraps with olive oil. Put a griddle pan or large frying pan on a medium heat, then fry two quesadillas at a time (if they’ll fit in your pan) for three to four minutes on each side, until golden brown. Serve two wraps immediately with half the salad, and cool and refrigerate the other two for lunchboxes tomorrow."

          "headline": "‘Not having a phone is the dream’: Jamie xx on dance music, modern life and getting hooked on surfing",
          "bodyText": "Jamie Smith has been incommunicado. He’s just returned from a holiday in Norway: a remote cabin in a quiet valley, where he had to catch his own fish for dinner. Best of all, he says with a blissful expression, there was no wifi or mobile phone reception. Smith talks about his phone like it’s a ravenous predator he has to go to great lengths to evade. It took him five days to stop instinctively reaching for it. “I have a lot of hang-ups about the phone,” he admits. “I’m annoyed how much control it has over me. It seems like that can’t be good for the brain.” It’s funny hearing Smith rhapsodise about the hermit life because he makes his living in loud places. As Jamie xx, he is not only one-third of the xx but perhaps the most far-reaching British DJ-producer of his generation – a cultural superconnector whose work transcends the club and bridges the spheres of pop and art. Yet at the same time, he is always trying to slow down and live in the moment. He does yoga. He surfs. He meditates, sporadically. He tries to read books in the evening instead of watching screens. He fantasises about giving it all up. “I love the idea of living in a beach shack and going surfing every day and that being it,” he says wistfully. “Not having a phone is the dream.” We’re sitting in an otherwise empty bar on the 10th floor of the Standard hotel in King’s Cross on a weekday afternoon. Far below, beyond the glass, London churns busily like a giant machine. Tousle-haired and bashful, Smith will never be the loudest voice in the room – even this one – but he is far more forthcoming than he used to be. For years, hiding behind his xx bandmates Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft in interviews, he was so taciturn that he might have been mistaken for someone who says little because he has little to say. But his friends describe a man of substance: curious, thoughtful, steadfast, empathetic. Only now is that person rising to the surface. “I’ve done hundreds of interviews with him and I’ve never seen him be the Jamie that I’m friends with before,” Sim tells me fondly. “The Jamie I know is very animated. He can sometimes be quite a camp straight man. I think he’s the most open and confident version of himself that he’s ever been.” Smith is 35 now. He was just 20 when the xx released their Mercury-winning, double-platinum debut album, transforming three introverted school friends into the toast of their town. Their haunting minimalism was sampled by Rihanna, underpinned countless TV shows and informed the sound of pop for years to come. At one intimate show in New York in 2014, they looked up to find themselves eyeball to eyeball with Madonna. It was a lot to take in for a band whose music looked inwards. “We all pushed one another and we all leaned on one another,” says Smith. While Sim and Madley Croft took time off between albums and tours, Smith’s extracurricular work kept him on the treadmill: studios, clubs, airports, hotels. He took on high-profile remixes (Adele, Radiohead) and production gigs (Drake, Alicia Keys) and DJed in as many as four clubs a weekend. He scored Wayne McGregor’s acclaimed ballet Tree of Codes, which led to further adventures in modern dance and art installations. And he released a breakout solo album, 2015’s In Colour, a vibrantly outgoing counterpoint to the xx’s nocturnal investigations. “Jamie is an unusual creator,” says the Californian artist Doug Aitken, a friend and collaborator. “He’s very polymedia, looking at a lot of strata of culture simultaneously. He’s constantly unearthing new things, culturally and intellectually. That’s an attractive trait.” All well and good on the work front, then, but when Smith looked at his friends – settling down, growing up – he worried that he was treading water as a human being. Rarely at home, he was insulated inside a touring bubble. “It was very easy to carry on in an adolescent way,” he says apologetically. “Especially in dance music, which is a very young person thing.” He felt as if he went years without having proper conversations, hiding in the noise, lagging behind his bandmates. “I think those two have had things going on in their lives that forced them to go deep. But it took me a lot longer to come to terms with some things.” Eventually he started asking himself why he made music at all. He thinks an album should tell a story about where you are in your life but he didn’t know the answer to that question, so most of the tracks he attempted with a view to following up In Colour were functional and lifeless. “None of it felt like it deserved to be out there.” Smith only stopped when the world did. He agrees that it’s weird that he enjoyed the 2020 lockdown as much as he did. “I didn’t know I needed it. It did make me stop and reflect on everything that had happened since I was a teenager, which was all amazing but very fast-paced and kind of the opposite to how I am. I had a chance to think about all the other bits that make you a human being that are not your job. My whole self-esteem was built around work, and that makes it hard to make music that’s going to connect with anyone, even yourself.” Being forced to rebalance his life set him on the four-year path to his extravagantly enjoyable second album, In Waves. “The fact that people are still interested is really heartwarming, especially as everything seems to go faster and faster in the world these days,” he says, sounding about 70. Jamie xx doesn’t have a signature sound so much as a signature feeling: an embracing joy with a twist of yearning. Aitken astutely calls it “euphoric melancholy”. If a track doesn’t promise to deliver that emotional fullness, it doesn’t get finished. “I’ve tried so hard to make a linear dance track and it’s just so boring,” Smith says. “I think in terms of a verse and chorus even if it’s instrumental. It tells more of a story.” Not a lyricist himself, he expresses himself through guest vocalists (Robyn, Panda Bear, his xx friends), crate-digging samples and, increasingly, spoken word: the dreamy dancefloor recollections of American singer Kelsey Lu on Dafodil, a monologue by yoga teacher Juliana Spicoluk threading through Breather’s big-room techno. The album’s cathartic finale, Falling Together, reworks a piece he made with the Belfast dancer and choreographer Oona Doherty for her 2022 show Navy Blue. “I said, ‘Jamie, there’s no hope in this show and we need to end on hope,’” the roaringly charismatic Doherty tells me. Now he has re-edited and reframed her monologue of “existential dread” as a healing sermon. “I think he’s taken the good bits out of me – get out of your own way, Oona! He’s not really a dread kind of guy.” One of Doherty’s phrases seems to sum up the whole album’s quest for transcendence: “the great let go”. Smith deploys these other voices to explore why people come together to dance. “I thought a lot about that,” he says. “It can be such a simplistic answer but it can be a lot more than that if you want it to be, especially if you dedicate your life to it.” It might get a bit pretentious, he allows with a soft laugh, “but there’s loads of more pretentious dance music out there”. Smith is a romantic about club culture. In Colour was his “nostalgic, rose-tinted” homage to a dancefloor era he was too young to experience. On the rave fantasia Gosh, he sampled the kind of pirate radio chatter that once beckoned him into an exotic, mysterious world. “It seemed like the coolest shit ever,” he says. “I wanted to be there but I had no idea where it was. I’d made up a whole story in my head before I’d ever been to a club.” Given that he now headlines festivals and venues as big as Alexandra Palace, it’s interesting that his introduction to proper clubbing was almost solitary. The first time he went to Plastic People in Shoreditch, the hub of the post-dubstep scene until its closure in 2015, “there was, like, three people. That seemed ideal to me. I could stand in a dark corner and learn to dance by watching people.” During those strange temporal grey areas in lockdown, when the country was tentatively half-open, he was cheered up by the illegal boat parties that took place on the canals near his east London home, seeming to echo the merry outlaw tenacity of early 90s rave culture. “People really wanted to do it so much that they were making a big effort,” he recalls. “Everyone was so happy to be back together in one place. Even if the music was terrible, the vibes were great.” Was the music terrible? He winces, laughs. “Oh yeah. But I’m so glad that they can exist.” * * * Smith’s parents were more old-fashioned music buffs. His mother, a teacher, loved Stax Records and his father, who worked in the housing department of Ealing council, had been a folk-rock drummer in the 1970s. One album he played on – 1975’s ultra-rare Jack With a Feather, by the preposterously named Spriguns of Tolgus – is the most valuable record in his son’s collection. After Smith met Sim and Madley Croft in his first year at Elliott School in Putney, they bonded over music, movies and skateboarding but he had no musical ambitions to speak of. Sim remembers walking back from school one day when they were 13 or 14: “He was like [shruggingly], ‘I’m not going to make big waves in this world and I’m totally cool with that.’ Whereas the rest of us were like, ‘I’m gonna be a rock star!’ There’s still part of him that’s like that. He genuinely has a lot of humility.” The other two formed the xx in 2005. Smith declined to be their drummer (“It seemed so wrong to be smashing drums next to Romy and Oliver’s beautiful quiet voices”) but found a role playing rhythms on an MPC synthesiser. (A fourth member, Baria Qureshi, left in 2009.) Perhaps he is the xx’s George Harrison, his talent potentiated by proximity to two more driven songwriters. “I was a bit of a late bloomer in many ways,” he agrees. “They’re the reason I get to do this. I still feel like we’re just friends at school and I’m so grateful that they’re letting me be in the band. I never imagined any of it was possible.” He sought out situations where he had to overcome his doubts and deliver. After various big-name producers failed to capture the fragile magic of the xx’s demos, he put himself forward to produce their debut. “I wasn’t elbowing my way in but I was trying really hard to prove that I could do it.” It was similar when XL Recordings founder Richard Russell asked him to remix Gil Scott-Heron’s 2010 comeback album, I’m New Here – Smith’s first solo project. “I’m glad that I was very naive. If I had to do the same now, I don’t think I could do it.” Smith likes to work with people he knows well: the only album he has produced for someone else to date is Sim’s 2022 solo record, Hideous Bastard. “He took a step into my world,” says Sim. “It takes a total lack of ego not to push himself into the music. I think he did that with the band as well, on the first record. If there was space in the music, the other producers tried to insert themselves, and he just left that space.” For Smith, making the album was as much about friendship as music: “I needed it as much as he did. We’d spend all day at the studio and then go home and play video games and watch TV and eat Nando’s. It was like being back at school.” In Waves completes the trifecta of overlapping xx solo albums, following Hideous Bastard and Madley Croft’s 2023 dance-pop extravaganza Mid Air, to which Smith also contributed. Recently, they’ve been back in the studio to plot the first xx record since 2017’s I See You, but they had to spend four days talking before they could pick up their instruments. “It’s proving to be hard,” Smith reveals. “They’re struggling with collaboration now that they’ve had complete creative control. I’m quite eager to not have complete control. It takes a lot of communicating, which we’re not very good at.” Even after all these years? He laughs. “Yeah. We do [communicate] in our lives but not when we’re together. We just revert back to our young selves.” Smith’s happy place is the ocean. He describes his first surfing lesson, in Hawaii in 2014, as a life-changing epiphany. “It blew my mind in a way I didn’t think could happen to me at 25. I was instantly hooked. I’m a city boy, I’ve never been about silence or nature, so that discovery was big for me.” He loves the “trippy, spiritual vibe” of surf culture. “For him, it’s not so much a sport as a reason to escape – to be in the moment,” says Doug Aitken. Smith agrees: “It’s very calming and fulfilling. It really makes me not want to make music. I’ve done surf trips where I also have a studio and the music I make is terrible because I’m just so happy.” But perhaps there is a connection between surfing and music, after all. He says he can sometimes find that same flowing, out-of-body sensation of being subsumed into something bigger than himself in the middle of a six-hour DJ set or in the studio, when a whole day of work can feel like half an hour. What he says about surfing is true of In Waves’s long gestation, too: “A lot of it is about being patient. Letting other people go and waiting for your moment.” In Waves is out now on Young Recordings. Jamie xx headlines Alexandra Palace, London on 25 and 26 September"

          "headline": "‘Students want to stay here now rather than disappear to London’: how design transformed the city of Dundee",
          "bodyText": "The city of Dundee, about 60 miles north of Edinburgh on Scotland’s east coast, was once best known for its industry: whaling and shipbuilding in the 19th century, then its celebrated “three Js” – jute, jam and journalism. But in recent years, Dundee has developed another reputation: as an arts and culture hub, and the UK’s first and only Unesco-designated “design city”. On Friday, at a former Michelin factory in the north-east of the city, the finishing touches were being put in place for the fifth Dundee design festival, which opens on Monday. The festival, held every two years, showcases work by more than 180 designers across disciplines including textiles, homeware and more. In the factory, a colourful woodland of knitted trees points towards a collection of bookends commissioned from Scottish designers and inspired by the globetrotting travels in 1894 of Dundee Courier journalists Marie Imandt and Bessie Maxwell. Elsewhere, sculpture made from coat hangers sits alongside jewellery, ceramics and furniture. “We’re obsessed with design and we just want other people to see why we’re so passionate about it,” said the festival’s creative director, Stacey Hunter. “You can tell so much about a society by the way it designs things and expresses itself. It’s what gives objects meaning.” Exhibits ranging from tables, chairs and vases to video games, costumes and aeroplane seats are displayed on reworked plinths and backdrops salvaged from previous exhibitions and retail deadstock – a mark of the festival’s zero-waste commitments. Visitors will be able to attend free practical drop-ins on disciplines ranging from screenprinting to biophilic design, alongside a programme of talks and discussions. This year’s festival will mark 10 years since Unesco designated Dundee a design city, alongside Berlin, Montreal, Istanbul and others. The accolade is given to cities that have an established design industry and opportunities for designers, among other criteria. “The designation recognises everything that was happening here already and it also gives us access to so much,” said Annie Marrs, lead officer for Unesco City of Design Dundee. “For us, it’s about getting design and creativity out into communities across the city. With the festival, we want to build capacity, grow skills, employ people and create opportunities to make a living from being a designer here.” In 2018, the Victoria and Albert Museum opened V&amp;A Dundee on the city’s waterfront, the star attraction in a £1bn regeneration of what was once dockland. The V&amp;A, Scotland’s first design museum, is housed in a striking geometric building designed by Japanese architects Kengo Kuma and Associates, and inspired by the jagged cliffs of north-east Scotland. The city is also home to Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (DJCAD), one of the UK’s top art schools. “I don’t think there’s another place in the UK that could have this building,” said the museum’s director, Leonie Bell. “With all our history and now the art school, the Unesco designation and the incredibly epic and exciting journey the design festival is on, you’ve got a real layering of design heritage in Dundee, but also the potential to use it and keep the future journey going.” The welcome desk for the festival stands upon a set of paving slabs – known by the Scots word “cassies”, which are cut with patterns to emulate woven designs associated with Dundee’s textile history. The cassies were co-created with Dundee residents after hundreds of hours of consultation about how they wanted the city centre’s redesigned Union Street to look. “Since the designation, we’ve been working more collectively with groups throughout the city, showcasing how design can make a positive impact to their daily lives,” said Gary Kennedy, a co-designer of the slabs and co-founder of the architectural practice Kennedy Twaddle. “We’re reaching a lot of different people that don’t consider themselves designers. We’re propped up by being a Unesco city of design. “That is having impacts in communities across the city.” Alongside his practice, Kennedy and the co-designer of the cassies, Linsey McIntosh, teach at DJCAD. McIntosh said their students benefited from the ambition driven by the Unesco recognition. “They’re not designing in a bubble within the confines of DJCAD, but getting out there and engaging with people and design across the city,” she said. “It gives them another string to their bow and makes them more employable. The opportunities are becoming more and more here – it’s really building momentum, and students want to stay here now rather than disappearing to London.” Designer and craftsman Camillo Feuchter, whose work features in the festival, graduated in June in interior and environmental design. On Dundee’s Annfield Road, the results of his ambitious thesis project can be seen in the form of EH9, a coffee shop. He designed and built its interior from scratch – from its service counters and partition walls to the 3D-printed lampshades inspired by the cafe’s rippled mugs, and stools built from recycled plastic. “There’s a really supportive creative community – within such a short time I feel so embedded,” said Feuchter. Many here describe Dundee as a “goldilocks” city for creativity: not too big and not too small, but just the right size to cultivate connections and create ambitious work. That is a description Feuchter recognises: “There’s so much going on, but it’s on a level where you can make a name for yourself.” That future looks bright for the city, with Scotland’s first iteration of the Eden project and a cutting edge visual effects lab among new developments set to arrive in the coming years. Back at the Michelin factory, between sewing costumes and adjusting lighting, Marrs said: “Things feel really exciting. “Our Unesco designation is for life and it belongs to everyone – there are so many possibilities.”"

          "bodyText": "More than £700,000 worth of free gifts and hospitality has been received by MPs in the past year for everything from Taylor Swift tickets to helicopter rides, new analysis reveals. The figures, based on data from the MPs’ register of interests between September 2023 and August 2024, come during a growing furore around the acceptance of gifts by the prime minister and his inner circle. According to his parliamentary register of interests, the Labour leader received more than £65,000 in gifts in the last year, including new clothes and accommodation funded by millionaire Labour peer Waheed Alli. The total value of what he has received is more than any other MP. On Friday, the prime minister pledged that he, Rachel Reeves and Angela Rayner will not accept any more free clothes from donors in an effort to draw a line under the debacle. The Conservatives have been critical of the number of gifts received by senior Labour figures and called for a full investigation into Starmer’s potential breaches of the rules. But Conservative MPs have also significantly benefited in gifts from wealthy benefactors – 141 Tory MPs received £359,891 in free gifts, including tickets paid for by the water industry and thousands of pounds of clay-pigeon shoots and helicopter rides from wealthy donors, according to Observer analysis. In the same period, 118 Labour MPs netted £298,151 worth of gifts. Nearly £80,000 of the total amount of freebies was given to MPs since the election in July, mostly to newly elected MPs. One of the biggest categories of freebies was football tickets or gigs hosted at football stadiums, which came to £96,000 in the last year. Free tickets have largely come from the Premier League and its football club members, many of whom are lobbying against Labour’s plans for a new independent regulator for the sport. Starmer himself has received thousands of pounds of corporate hospitality tickets to watch Arsenal games in the last year, a move he said was necessary due to security concerns about him sitting in the stands. One of the other significant spenders, the gambling industry, spent more than £20,000 on gifts for MPs over the last year. While corporate hospitality passes to football games, golf tournaments and tennis matches were common, 11 MPs also received more than £17,000 worth of free tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras tour. There are growing calls for reforms to the way MP gift declarations work and for an overhaul of the ministerial code. On Friday, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued in a piece for the Guardian that scandals like that over Starmer’s acceptance of free clothes have helped show the party leadership’s “crushingly disappointing response” to being in power. Meanwhile Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, told the Times the scandal was “a good example of the Westminster bubble, where everyone is doing it without really thinking through how it looks to the wider public”. “The country is at a bad time, everyone is going to have to make sacrifices,” she added. “It does not look right if politicians making some of the decisions are having nice freebies.”"

          "bodyText": "Their father, Vincent, is dying. And this, perhaps, is the only thing that estranged sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) and Katie (Carrie Coon) can agree upon. Flung together in the Manhattan apartment where Vincent (Jay O Sanders) lived, with Rachel on hand as his carer and companion, the women’s long-submerged tensions bubble to the surface. Written and directed by Azazel Jacobs – who, as his 2008 breakthrough success Momma’s Man demonstrated, has a knack for raw, perceptive explorations of New York family dynamics – His Three Daughters is sublime in its simplicity and elegance; exquisitely judged in its balance between tragedy and comedy. It’s shot almost entirely in the claustrophobic single location of the apartment: Rachel gets to venture outside to a bench, but only because Katie takes issue with her “top shelf” weed habit. This is subtle, unshowy film-making that is entirely in the service of the screenplay and the performances – and what performances. In a just world, all three stars would be at the very top of the list of potential awards contenders for the coming season. As Katie, Coon is barricaded behind crossed arms and a layer of superiority; she delivers her lines in a rapid-fire assault of judgment. Olsen plays Christina, the youngest; a bit of a space cadet, with a beatific, slightly baffled smile and a sense of permanent disconnect. And Rachel, the stepsister and odd-one-out, is brought to life by a wonderfully lived-in performance from Lyonne, who demonstrates that she’s as gifted a dramatic actor as she is a comedian.

          "bodyText": "There is barely a wrinkle on the surface of Frederick Henry Bay as Grace Tame stands still, slides her blue eyes right and reboots the side-eye that launched a thousand memes. Tame’s snub of prime minister Scott Morrison – deployed at a photocall marking the end of her tenure in 2022 – is an image that came to outlast many from an entire year of official duties as 2021 Australian of the Year, and sent some into a tailspin. “That’s the one that took down the government – sort of,” the 29-year-old child sexual abuse survivor and advocate says before we rejoin the Roches beach track, having wandered our way along the coast towards Seven Mile beach on nipaluna/Hobart’s easternmost fringe. Various things ended the Morrison government, of course, but its relationship with women was one of them. “I mean everyone was ready for that, everybody was done with him.” That encounter, and the commentary it sparked, was a good example of how moments are so often taken out of context and repackaged to suit others. It’s a lesson she learned at the age of 16 during the first court case of her rapist, school teacher Nicolaas Bester. In news coverage, she was painted as the aggressor and the abuse romanticised. The Murdoch press’s coverage in 2011 still sickens her. “Nothing has even come close to what that was like. That was horrific,” she says. There’s a jarring disconnect between the past we are talking about and the grass-lined, gum-dappled coastal path on this bright August morning. Tame has been up since 4.30am, has done Bikram yoga and had a run. She’s wearing a jumper emblazoned with the art of Martin Sharp: “This is a symposium on beauty” it reads across the back. A tattoo on her hand saying “Eat my fear” is taken from a David Lynch sculpture deemed so grotesque it did not make it to public viewing. Along with the infinite calm of the setting, the combined effect is one of soaring loveliness coexisting with the fact that some things are hard to stomach. Here, she is enveloped in her home habitat, around the corner from her father’s place and a stone’s throw from her grandparents’. She runs this path at least once a month, chasing active meditation as a foil to her role as CEO of the Grace Tame Foundation, working to improve child abuse prevention and responses. “The work that I do goes in peaks and troughs. Some weeks I might receive a deluge of disclosures or there might be a particular incident that I’m processing,” she says of the need to move her body and be close to the ocean. There’s a “weird paradox” between living in the public eye and within “her own little bubble”, sometimes oblivious to and often amused by the distortions of fame. On one hand, she has helped elevate conversations around child sexual abuse, dismantle shame and connect communities. On the other, her award brought with it a tumultuous three years that put as much strain on herself as it did on her family and loved ones. Abuse was amplified, with trolls finding “every crevice that they could creep through”, she says. Along the way, she was conflated with other advocates with whom she had little in common. “It’s been quite difficult to negotiate some of the consequences of the multidirectional pressure that came as a result of that award,” she says. Grounding connections – with friends, with the bushland under her feet – are important, particularly as she lives with autism. “Most people are in the spotlight deliberately … it’s more strategic and they have more supports in place to protect them. I was sort of just thrust on to this platform out of obscurity and … into a really fraught space in a really fraught dialogue.” She’ll soon be back on stage – this time one of her own choosing – when she appears in her forthcoming speaking tour, exploring how she survived that spotlight. A hefty part of her armoury was laughter, something that has been cast as at odds with the experience of victim-survivors. “For a long time, victim-survivorship was seen as a one-note experience that defined an individual, which is bullshit in my opinion,” she says. And while it may be true that the best humour is not about making fun of others, she “will probably be making a few laughs at the expense of Mr Bester because he is a bit of a comedy piñata”. In one of her jokes, she describes him as having the child sexual offender starter pack: “He wears New Balance 1080s, he’s a Catholic schoolteacher, he plays the fucking organ. All he needs is a Mr Whippy van and he’s got the full set.” On the tour, she’ll be wrangled by a host each evening and, while she is both disarmingly honest and understandably guarded, she’s performed standup before, debuting with A Rational Fear live in Melbourne in 2022. Her entire five-minute set at the same show last year was aimed at defaming Rupert Murdoch. (Her other bete noir, Morrison, remains “in the bin”. At any rate, she says she is an anarchist and has little time for politicians, no matter their stripes.) “It’s just [about] having a good time,” she says of the show. Many people in the audience will be autistic, she says, and she hopes they feel safe and “free to be themselves”. Still, she is aware that everything she does can become news, somehow: her hair, her muscles, speaking out, not smiling. “You cede power to whoever consumes that content. But the people who are on your side, they understand you and your intentions,” she says. “And you’ve got to trust that process.” We walk past what real estate agents call a substantial property with commanding views, its lawn stretched towards the tiny cove of Peaches beach. Occasionally, when running, she’ll climb down for a swim, and her mother (who is also her neighbour and landlord) swims in the ocean every day, calling it her natural shock therapy. Tame’s knuckles are inkily etched with her grandparents’ surnames: Tame and Free. Those hands do their own drafting, often in biro, usually hyperreal and swirling with icons from the many lives that have so far fitted into her years. For Tame has survived low lows, made even more extraordinary by their timing. Nine months before receiving the Australian of the Year award, she was living in Los Angeles, where life “was rough as guts”. She had been addicted to drugs, lived out of her car, worked for minimum wage. And, “Jesus fucking Christ, I was married.” She started running again, got sober and became celibate. She was so anorexic that she was unable to think clearly, going to bed at 6pm each evening. “I was almost chasing this pre-abuse state. I looked at a picture of myself recently from that time … I was a rake. It was so sad. So much trauma.” Back on our stage, a pademelon lollops past, then another. Tame is 12 weeks post endometriosis surgery. Within six weeks – “typical me”, she says – she was back running 80km a week, leaving her with tendonitis. A couple of years ago, she fractured her pelvis and foot by running too much. This week is a 68km week – she’s preparing to defend her Bruny Island ultramarathon title in late November, recently completed the Great Ocean Road ultra and in February will run the Kilimanjaro marathon. Forcing her to rest takes a straightjacket, she admits. Long-term thinking plays no part in her neurodivergent outlook – but she has stuck to the plan to step back from her CEO role and is about to select a new chief executive from 91 applicants. It’ll leave her with more time for advocacy, sketching, travelling. There’re still mistakes to be made and lessons to learn, she says. “I am one of those ‘I’ll do anything’ sorts of people. I’ve had such a strange life, really,” she says, before applying a running lesson to the unpredictabilities that she knows lie ahead. “If you resist the forces outside of your control, they only hurt more,” she says. “You just have to accept that there’s nothing to master, you are one with the elements. They are part of you, you are part of them, and that’s how you get through it. That’s life. Nama-fuckin’-ste, bitches.” Lightening the Load with Grace Tame is touring around Australia"

          "bodyText": "A year ago today we launched Guardian Europe, a new digital edition of the Guardian to help bring journalism about the world to Europe and journalism about Europe to the world. It has been a dramatic year for the continent, with moments of intense political peril, from huge far-right electoral surges to extraordinary people power and progressive fightbacks. It has also been a year of sporting joy at the Paris Games and Euro 2024. We’ve been there to capture it all, and we’re very grateful that millions of you have joined us. The history of Europe is enmeshed with the 203-year history of the Guardian, revolutions, wars and all. Soon after Britain left the European Union in 2020, I wrote to readers pledging that the Guardian would become even more European in its perspective, not less. The result of that renewed focus was the launch of a digital edition – our fifth, alongside our UK, US, Australia and international editions – powered by an expanded network of correspondents and commentators. Our hope was, and remains, to expand the number of people across Europe using Guardian journalism as their primary English-language global news source. I’m delighted to report that Guardian Europe has been a resounding success. We’ve witnessed sustained growth in our audiences and deep levels of interest and engagement from readers old and new. The Guardian Europe front page has become our second most popular, behind the UK edition, and our European audience is our second most engaged overall. Single financial contributions from readers in Europe are up 45% and our supporter base has increased by 8%. It’s been important to remember that our readers in Europe have a global perspective. They come to us for expert coverage of international affairs and to understand a complex world. This year, that has included the ongoing horror in the Middle East and the latest from the frontlines in Ukraine as well as the ceaseless anxiety-inducing drama of the US presidential election. And we’ve shared deeply reported European stories with the rest of the world, too. As well as Lili Bayer’s daily live blog covering the biggest breaking stories across the continent, our reporters have delved into the causes of, and possible solutions to, a housing crisis afflicting young people from Lisbon to Łódź and have reported extensively on the scourge of overtourism, as well as ideas to tackle it (go to fewer places, stay longer). Our new European culture editor Philip Oltermann has helped to share artistic gems across the language divide from the rise of a Serbian horror writer to a pioneering Czech documentarian, while new European sport correspondent Nick Ames has told vital stories outside the bubble of mainstream sports, from Ukrainian Olympians and Paralympians training against the odds to a football derby in Belgrade that offers a snapshot of local and global tensions. European environment correspondent Ajit Niranjan has been an important addition to an environment team that has focused on the fatal impact of extreme heat and wildfires in Europe as well as an increasingly dangerous rightwing backlash to green policies. And Ashifa Kassam, our new European community affairs correspondent, has produced vital articles about people in countries such as France and Germany who are feeling the brunt of the rise in the far-right vote. Ashifa was often the first person to speak to many of these communities, from either local or international media. Our expanded team of brilliant columnists, many from beyond the Anglosphere, have become essential reading, too. The likes of Fatma Aydemir, Rokhaya Diallo, María Ramírez and Nathalie Tocci are among those who have helped Guardian readers to understand the dramatic political, social and cultural challenges facing Europe. Our opinion writers have made strident interjections into important debates: from the grind of being LGBTQ+ in Giorgia Meloni’s Italy to the failures of the EU to recruit more people of colour. They have also been busy confounding national stereotypes: from the “Kafkaesque” hell of commuting on Germany’s failing train network to a Swedish parent lamenting being a “bad dad”. Speaking to our writers about the impact Guardian Europe has made, they tell us that it has allowed them to chart new territories with a renewed effort and deep focus, to amplify voices that have previously gone unheard, and to share hundreds of good ideas about how to run a society. Miranda Bryant, hired as our new Nordic correspondent, looked at how sauna culture helps to make Finns so happy, while we also investigated how Ireland became the world’s literary powerhouse, why young people in Lithuania are so happy and how Vienna cracked housing to become the world’s most livable place.

          "bodyText": "In 1998, life was good for Ilya. She was a post-graduate student in women’s studies at York University in Toronto, and had started dating Ashley (not her real name) “the big romance” of her 20s. “I was living in a house share and having a great time,” she says. Ashley started a band with some women on campus and it wasn’t long before Amy came into their lives. She was working as an education coordinator in an art gallery when she was introduced to Ashley by a friend. “I’d been playing drums since I was a teenager and I was keen to meet new friends,” she says. “As soon as she introduced me to the rest of the group, the band, Lazy Susan, was formed.” After several weeks of rehearsal, they were ready for their first performance. “It was at a student house party predominantly for queer and lesbian graduate students,” says Amy. “I was terrified of going. Although I’d been out for a few years, I wasn’t comfortable flirting with people.” After playing a few songs with the band, Amy bumped into Ilya. “I remember she had an eyebrow piercing which I thought was very edgy,” she says. “Ilya seemed really calm and warm. I felt safe talking to her.” Ilya says they clicked immediately. “It felt like we were in this magical little bubble together. I remember it being really funny and energetic.” They began to see each other more regularly at the band’s gigs and developed a strong friendship. “We used to go to pot luck dinner parties, where everyone brings a dish,” says Amy. “I had a great apartment in downtown Toronto and would invite people over. We also went to my family’s lake house with all our friends.” In 2001, Ilya broke up with Ashley. “When they split up, I remember thinking I really wanted to keep up our friendship,” says Amy. They continued to hang out in the same spots until 2007, when Ilya got a job as professor of gender studies at the University of British Columbia and moved to Kelowna, nearly 2,000 miles west. “While I was super excited for her, it was hard. Even now, I sometimes feel a bit sad that she’s so far away,” says Amy. Despite the distance, their friendship continued. “We have phone calls and lots of texting almost every day. I don’t feel there’s anything I couldn’t tell her.” They visit each other four times a year, and plan to celebrate their 50th birthdays together in 2025. When Ilya had an operation in 2009, Amy travelled across the country to help her. “It’s really special to have someone do that for you, who isn’t your partner or your mother,” says Ilya. They have supported each other through relationships and breakups. Ilya is now married to a man and has a stepdaughter, Amy has two children with her ex-wife, from whom she separated in 2017. “We go up to her family’s lake cottage together with my stepdaughter and she gets on so well with Amy’s kids.” Ilya has continued her academic career, while Amy retrained as a teacher. She recently left the profession after suffering some health issues. “I developed severe endometriosis in 2010 and when the pandemic started I ended up having a full hysterectomy,” she says. “I’ve lived in a lot of pain and it’s tanked my confidence, but Ilya has been my rock throughout. She has this really successful career, but doesn’t judge me for taking time out before I decide my next steps.” Ilya says they have both had mental health challenges over the years, and supported each other throughout. “We both have anxiety and are able to talk about it to each other. We even exchange tips on managing it better,” she says. “Whenever I feel overwhelmed, she will share the loveliest long messages.” Ilya loves her friend’s commitment to honesty. “It’s a hard thing to do but it’s so valuable. Amy is very emotionally intelligent, she’s like my emotional hero.” Amy admits she often feels insecure in friendships but that is never the case with Ilya. “I am someone who really struggles to believe I can be loved, but Ilya is the one person I trust deeply and feel completely at ease with,” she says. “I think of her all the time, even when we’re not communicating, and it’s such a gift to have a friend like that.”"

          "headline": "How to make a classic French omelette – recipe",
          "bodyText": "It’s odd that in English we have only one word for a dish as multifarious as the omelette, which is used for everything from a solid Spanish wedge of potato and egg to the golden American half-moon encompassing a generous filling. The quickest and simplest example, however, is the classic French omelette, which goes from shell to plate in less than five minutes, and is a skill that’s well worth mastering. Prep 1 min Cook 3 min Serves 1 2 eggs Salt and black pepper 1 generous knob butter – about 1 tbsp Filling of your choice (optional) 1 A note on the size The amounts listed are for individual omelettes because, unlike the tortilla española, this is a dish that’s best kept small, plus in larger quantities it’s all too easy to overcook. Note that if your omelette is to be perfectly round, you’ll need a small frying pan, preferably a fairly heavy-based one (I used a 23cm diameter one). 2 Beat the eggs Crack the eggs into a jug or bowl, season generously, then whisk until just combined; if you overwhisk, you’ll introduce air into the mixture, which is not the aim here (unlike in the omelette souffle in step 8). If you’re particularly hungry, add a third egg, but bear in mind that your omelette will then take slightly longer to cook. 3 To fill or not to fill? Lay out any fillings by the hob. I often eat omelettes plain, but they are a good vehicle for most cooked leftovers, as well as grated cheese, chopped herbs, shredded ham, diced tomatoes, cooked or defrosted frozen spinach, etc. Avoid anything too wet, though, so squeeze out the water from spinach, remove the seeds from tomatoes and so on. 4 Coat the pan in melted butter Once you’re ready to cook, put a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, add the butter and swirl it around in the pan so it greases the entire base. Once the butter has melted, it will begin to foam. Wait for this to die down slightly, then pour in the eggs, which should sizzle as they hit the pan. 5 Cook the eggs Shake the pan to distribute the eggs evenly across the base, then leave to cook undisturbed for 20 seconds, until the eggs begin to bubble up. At this point, add any filling of your choice, remembering that this will be a classic rolled omelette, so there’s no need to confine it to one side. 6 Draw the cooked edges into the centre The eggs should by now be beginning to set around the edge of the pan. Using a spatula or fork, draw the cooked edges of the egg mix into the centre while shaking the pan to redistribute the liquid egg to the edges. The omelette is done when it’s still slightly runny in the middle, though you can, of course, cook it right through, if that’s your preference. 7 Fold, shape and serve Take the pan off the heat and fold two opposite edges into the middle. Shake the pan so they roll together, then tilt the pan and turn out your omelette on to a warm plate. Don’t worry if your omelette is not perfectly shaped – you can always tidy it up before serving, if you like. Season and eat immediately, while it’s still deliciously runny. 8 Or, for a more airy alternative … For a fancier take, you might prefer an omelette souffle, for which I tend to use three eggs, not least because the bigger it is, the more impressive it looks. Crack the eggs into a bowl, season and beat until foamy. Put a lightly greased small frying pan on a medium heat, and keep beating the eggs until they are thick and almost mousse-like. 9 … try an omelette souffle Pour the mixture into the pan and leave to cook until the base begins to set. Gently lift up one side and slide a knob of butter underneath, tilting the pan so the butter melts and coats the bottom of the pan. Once the bottom is a deep golden colour and the top still foamy and loose, slide the omelette on to a plate and fold over."

          "bodyText": "Good afternoon. More details, reactions and questions are emerging after the unprecedented attack against militant group Hezbollah, in which thousands of pagers were remotely and simultaneously detonated across Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding almost 3,000. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, said a young girl was among the dead, and that at least 200 people had critical injuries. The Taiwanese manufacturer linked to the pagers that exploded as part of the attack has said the devices were made by a company in Europe. “The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,” said Hsu Ching-Kuang, the founder of electronics company Gold Apollo. In Australia, the Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said the attack “is exactly the type of sickening warfare people in Naarm Melbourne were protesting against”, while the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, said “probably every intelligence agency in the world is waking up this morning and asking themselves, how do we stop this happening to us?” Top news Secret defence report tabled after publication ‘error’ | The Albanese government has published a report recommending an overhaul of the military justice system after it was discovered published “in error” on the website of the royal commission into veteran suicide after being provided on a confidential basis. Arrests over alleged criminal messaging app | Dozens of people have been arrested as part of an investigation into an encrypted messaging network known as “Ghost”, the first of its kind to allegedly be administered by an Australian, and a platform trumpeted as “un-hackable”. Moira Deeming defamation trial continues | The ousted Victorian Liberal MP told the federal court she was “determined to be brave” by attending a controversial “Let Women Speak” rally despite security warnings, and that she “didn’t know” about Nazi salutes performed on the steps of parliament. CFMEU supporters hit the streets | Victorian building unions are threatening a strike of up to three days if employers don’t stop a “sustained attack” on pay and conditions, the head of the electricians’ union has said, as members rallied in Sydney and Melbourne against the placing of the CFMEU into administration. ‘Not the actions of a friend’ | The federal opposition has criticised a video appearing to show a Chinese military aircraft in a “dangerous” interception with an Australian surveillance plane in 2022, with the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, calling on Anthony Albanese to raise the matter with Xi Jinping. Murdoch succession battle deepens | As a secret legal case over the future control of News Corp is heard in the US, investors are seeking to loosen share voting powers that allow Rupert Murdoch and his heirs to maintain a firm grip on the media empire. Kashmir votes in ‘crossroads’ election | There is a palpable buzz in the Himalayan region of India, as Kashmiris go to the polls on Wednesday to vote for their first regional assembly since 2014 – the first since the region was stripped of its statehood by prime minister Narendra Modi. Fake Harris hit-and-run video | A Russian propaganda unit created a video claiming Kamala Harris was involved in an alleged hit-and-run incident, paid an actor to appear as the alleged victim and spread the claim through a fake news website, Microsoft researchers have found. Lizard nostril bubbles | Water anoles, small lizards dubbed “chicken nuggets of the forest” that plunge into streams to evade predators, survive underwater by breathing through a bubble that forms on their nostrils, researchers say. In pictures Australia’s farming shopfront: Henty Machinery Field Days More than 50,000 people are expected to descend on the town in southern New South Wales for the largest agricultural event in Australia. More than 800 exhibitors are spread across a 104-hectare specially built site for the three-day field event, which organisers say connects agricultural businesses and farmers who use their products and technology to increase efficiency, profitability and sustainability. What they said … *** “Social media companies know very well they directly benefit from our anger, divisiveness and the valuable time we spend on their platforms. So, until they own responsibility, I see the government’s proposed ban as a small but significant step.” Writing for Guardian Australia, Chanel Contos, the founder of Teach Us Consent, says that until social media giants take responsibility for the harm they cause, she supports the government’s proposed ban for children. In numbers Japan’s long campaign to appoint more women to senior roles in business and industry has suffered a blow, after a survey found only 0.8% of top firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were led by women. The proportion of senior women in business remains low even under the government’s wider definition of “executive”, which includes corporate officers, as well as directors, auditors and executive officers. Before bed read Stamps, sticks and stories: looking for traces of baseball in North Korea Earlier this year, when a baseball team made up of young North Korean defectors toured the US, American and South Korean media reported that baseball was “unheard of” in the North. But like a trail of breadcrumbs, there are signs this most cherished of American sports may still be played in a country that calls itself the “biggest enemy” of the US.

          "bodyText": "Pencil-long lizards that plunge into streams to evade their predators survive underwater by breathing through a bubble that forms on their nostrils, researchers say. Water anoles live around rocks and plants near streams and waterfalls in Central and South America and are preyed on by birds, snakes and other lizards, making life in the forest an often short affair. But the ever-present risk of being eaten alive has driven the lizards to evolve several escape strategies. When camouflage and scarpering for shelter fail, the lizards launch themselves into streams, where they remain submerged until the threat has passed. Scientists knew that water anoles produced bubbles over their nostrils when diving for cover, but whether the bubbles helped them stay underwater for longer – and so improved their odds of survival – was far from clear. “We know that they can stay underwater for a really long time,” said Dr Lindsey Swierk, who studies anoles at Binghamton University in New York. “We didn’t know whether there was actually any functional role for this bubble in respiration.” When water anoles take the plunge, they exhale to produce a bubble that covers their nostrils. But tiny bubbles form naturally on the lizard’s hydrophobic, or water-repellent, skin and these join up with the larger bubble, potentially raising the amount of oxygen available to breathe. To see whether anoles used their bubbles to breathe underwater, Swierk recorded how long the lizards remained submerged with and without moisturiser smeared on their skin. The moisturiser prevented the bubbles from forming properly. Writing in Biology Letters, Swierk describes how water anoles stayed underwater 32% longer without the moisturiser to disrupt their bubbles. “When they are prevented from forming regular rebreathing bubbles, they can’t dive quite as long,” Swierk said. While the anoles stayed underwater for only a few minutes in the study, they can be submerged for about 20 minutes in the wild. Water anoles are so heavily predated that Swierk calls them “the chicken nuggets of the forest”. Their first line of defence on spotting a predator is to freeze and hope their camouflage conceals them. If the predator pursues them, the next option is to make a dash for a crack in a rock. Diving into streams is the last resort, not least because it can lower their body temperature and make them sluggish. “At least to their human pursuers, like us researchers, diving is by far the most effective means of escape,” Swierk said. “Once underwater, they’re very hard to detect through the moving stream surface.”"

          "headline": "The Lib Dems need a tight policy focus – but the stunts are here to stay",
          "bodyText": "About 10 days in to the election campaign, after Ed Davey clambered into a rubber ring to ride down a water slide in his swimming trunks, several fellow Liberal Democrat MPs quietly warned they might struggle to defend such stunts in interviews. Ten days further on, after the Lib Dem leader jumped off a 150ft high platform at Eastbourne FC, shouting out to voters to “take a leap of faith” and vote for his party, any doubters had been thoroughly won round. “Within moments of the bungee jump there was wall-to-wall media coverage,” says one party insider. “Ed was on the front page of the BBC website – with a picture of Keir Starmer giving some worthy speech tucked away at the bottom – and was all over the TV bulletins. It was incredible.” As an election strategy, it was simple but hugely effective: combat the usual lack of attention for a smaller party with images of a wetsuit-clad or Zumba-dancing Davey, with each stunt linked the party’s core policy areas of the NHS and care, sewage, and the cost of living. “In other elections, when we did get airtime we’d be asked about Labour or the Tories, or why we were so useless,” another party insider says. “This time we were asked about our policies.” Going from 15 MPs to 72 was a dramatic vindication of the strategy, but as Davey closes a gleeful Lib Dem conference in Brighton, some in the party are wondering whether more of the same will work again. One thing is clear: for now, the tight policy focus remains – as do the stunts. On Saturday, Davey arrived at Brighton marina on a jetski. Later in the conference he accepted a challenge to recite the names of all of his MPs while riding the rollercoaster on the city’s pier. Some Lib Dems express private worry about this, wanting the party to focus also on areas that distinguish them from Labour, for example on Brexit and a suite of relatively radical tax policies in the election manifesto. But, for now, Davey seems invulnerable, the beneficiary of an image revamp in which his team sought to highlight the empathy that comes with his role as a carer for his disabled teenage son, and his inherent sense of fun and mischief. The election stunts are direct descendants of the camera-friendly visual metaphors the party began using to celebrate a series of byelection wins, such as Davey bursting a giant Tory-blue bubble, and lighting a giant cardboard cannon. These emerged almost by accident when the party suddenly realised they were on course to win the hugely safe Tory seat of Chesham and Amersham, just outside London, in 2021. A team of party aides hit on the image of Davey demolishing a “blue wall”, a plan so last-minute that the flatpack cardboard boxes were only assembled after the count, with a staffer sent to B&amp;Q to find a yellow hammer. Davey’s very visible enjoyment of these events led to an election brainstorming session in which staffers wrote down a list of 50 possible stunts, some of which were then crossed off as either too dangerous – wing-walking – or undignified. There were still mishaps. Only a last-minute schedule change stopped Davey shooting arrows at an archery centre in Cambridgeshire while also outlining the party’s policy on bereavement payments. This ended up coinciding with the bungee jump – only a slight improvement. “When we first came up with the strategy it was supposed to show Ed’s human side, how much fun he could be, as an antidote to some of the disillusionment with politicians,” says one senior aide. “But in the end it bought us airtime.” Internal party polling found that the under-30s in Lib Dem target seats liked the stunts, while they also resonated with middle-aged voters, who enjoyed what one aide called “the centrist dad vibes”. Some older voters, however, were turned off by the antics, which they viewed as unserious. But Davey’s team had a second act to come: a highly personal election broadcast that showed the Kingston and Surbiton MP at home with his son, John, and reminiscing about having cared as a child for his terminally ill mother. This was widely viewed and well received. So what now? For one thing, Davey has 71 colleagues to keep busy, with a frontbench revamp expected soon. Newer MPs with smaller majorities will be encouraged to focus on their constituencies, while others will join select committees. Two of the most influential of these, health and the environment, are now chaired by Lib Dems. The party’s leadership wants to be a “critical friend” to Labour, supporting the government on some of the big issues where there is broad agreement, but holding its feet to the fire when they need to, and keeping up the pressure in areas like social care reform. At times, the mantra of constructive opposition to Labour will be a tricky balancing act. More MPs could also mean more moaning – one recurrent joke in Brighton has been Lib Dems saying that they can finally have some factions. But, the hope is, it will still be fun."

          "bodyText": "Winner: Arizona Cardinals It is always satisfying to see shaky NFL narratives proven false shortly after they bubble up, especially when it concerns a first-round draft pick. The knives were out for Arizona’s rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr after his one-catch debut against the Buffalo Bills in week one. Some assessments were unkind to say the least: “shockingly slow and uncertain” was one of the more gentle ones on social media. But some grace for a difficult debut was due considering how a fierce Bills defense limited his impact. On Sunday, he put in a redo for the record books as he torched the LA Rams with two touchdowns and 130 yards in the opening quarter, more than his father gained in any quarter in his Hall of Fame career. The highlight was a 60-yard score in which Harrison’s raw speed turned tight coverage into a yawning runway. Rams safety Kamren Curl is still asking for directions to the nearest end zone. Loser: Baltimore Ravens Isaiah Likely cannot catch a break. A week after a toenail out of bounds ruled out a touchdown and the chance of upsetting the Kansas City Chiefs, the shoulder of Jack Jones arrived to disrupt Likely’s stunning sideline catch. The Las Vegas cornerback’s rude arrival upset a play that would have given Justin Tucker a makeable field goal to tie the game with one second remaining. After losing two winnable games, the Ravens are now scratching their heads at 0-2. There is no shame in losing to Patrick Mahomes and none, on paper, to the Raiders either. The added context of John Harbaugh’s team turning a 10-point final quarter lead into a 26-23 defeat, a familiar trend for a team who often struggle to put opponents away, is where things turn sour for the Ravens. Since the start of the 2022 season Baltimore have blown a double-figure lead seven times. Sure, Maxx Crosby helped bulldoze the Raiders back into contention, but killer errors, such as Brandon Stephens’ pass interference giving Las Vegas a gimme touchdown, mean a tough trip to Dallas now looks like a must win with the Bills and Bengals waiting in the wings. Winner: kickers Is it just me or are kickers enjoying a hot streak, wrapped in a golden age, inside an apex? Everywhere you look 50-yard bombs are thundering through the uprights. The numbers are incredible: as of Sunday, 136 field goals had been made from 146 attempts at a 93% success rate. Last season the success rate was 89% over the opening two weeks and 86% across the season as a whole – the second-highest hit rate after 2013’s 86.5% (the average season success rate since 2013 is 84%.) The numbers only get you so far though. The Commanders brought in Austin Siebert after Cade York’s two misses in week one. First-day jitters? Nope. The new kid scored every point of Washington’s 21-18 win over the New York Giants, with seven field goals. Veteran Chris Boswell did something similar for Pittsburgh, with six from six in week one. The NFL’s elite feet have gone from making 80% of total field goals in just one season last century to now forming an army of Justin Tucker clones (although Baltimore’s historically accurate boot is one of only three kickers to have missed twice this season). Harrison Butker’s game-winning 51-yarder for the Chiefs against the Bengals neatly tied a double bow on things. His kick hit the safety net so high up it looked as if it might have challenged Tucker’s 66-yard NFL record. How much better can these kickers get? Loser: Anthony Richardson Would the Colts have been better off keeping Gardner Minshew? It feels wrong to suggest so, considering the upside of Anthony Richardson’s ridiculous arm – the overhead view of his 60-yard score last week has to be seen to be believed. But his former backup did have some success last season as the Colts just missed out on the playoffs, a scenario that feels unlikely under the prevailing wind in 2024, with the Colts at 0-2. On Sunday Richardson’s high stakes style delivered all of the risk and none of the reward with three interceptions in an embarrassing loss to the Packers, who were led by backup Malik Willis. While QB suitability is always going to be questioned after such a defeat, the bigger issue for the Colts is how much pressure their flimsy defense is putting on Richardson. Behind the limited capacity of Willis, Green Bay’s plan was always going to be to run the ball. A lot. Yet Indy laid down to such an extent they allowed 164 rushing yards in one quarter and 261 in total, missing 16 tackles in the process. And this after they gifted 213 rushing yards to the Texans in the first week of the season. Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley’s run defense regressed despite knowing what Green Bay would do. The Packers just hogged the ball, chewing up an immense 40 minutes of possession to Indy’s 20, the exact energy-sapping split as against Houston. Richardson or any other quarterback will fail if the defense continues to skew games so wildly away from the Colts’ control. Winner: defensive disciples New Orleans and Minnesota were given intimidating defensive assignments on Sunday. The Saints had to stop a Cowboys team on a 16-game regular-season home winning streak, while the Vikings had a visit from Kyle Shanahan’s mighty 49ers. Both teams were huge underdogs. Both were driven to stunning wins through defensive might. While Derek Carr pitched an MVP innings on one side of the ball, his defensive counterparts pulled their weight with three sacks and two interceptions. Dak Prescott looked shot to pieces as he came back with nothing from three trips to the red zone. The Saints’ most impressive turn was cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry holding CeeDee Lamb to 90 yards on four catches. The rookie is proving a more than capable understudy to Marshon Lattimore. The Vikings have their own star in defensive coordinator Brian Flores. He wrote the perfect script to disrupt Brock Purdy and the 49ers. Flores’s creative blitz schemes generated seven QB pressures and six sacks. Credit must also go to GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah whose acquisition of free-agent linebackers Blake Cashman, Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel has added bite this season. They each had one sack while Cashman also deflected three passes. Purdy’s honest post-game praise of Flores says it all: “Your scheme is crazy.”"

          "headline": "‘I filed my copy from Waterloo station loos’: the Guardian’s theatre critics assess The Critic",
          "bodyText": "‘The friendship between a critic and an actor violates a boundary’ Arifa Akbar Oh, how I’d love to take bubble baths in the morning, long lunches at my club in the afternoon and arrive in the stalls by evening with my secret lover-cum-amanuensis and pencil-carrier in tow. Jimmy Erskine (Ian McKellen), chief drama critic of the Daily Chronicle, really does have it good. My quotidian reality as chief theatre critic of the Guardian cannot compare: a supermarket sandwich wolfed down before the bell, a frantic filing of copy after the curtain goes down (from a bench by the loos at Waterloo station on one occasion), or eating biscuits at my laptop into the small hours if it is a morning deadline. But then, Erskine is an acid-tongued anachronism, part of a dying “old guard” even in the 1930s of the film. His portrait still contains a kernel of historical truth, though: Erskine is part of a bygone era when a single, revered critic held godlike sway over public opinion. His real-life counterparts were many, from Kenneth Tynan to “Butcher of Broadway” Frank Rich, whose most scabrous notices could close a show. Those imperious emperor-critics are no more, their unilateral power diluted by the growth of the internet, with its mix of theatre vloggers, TikTokers, and other online critical voices who represent different ways of reviewing a show. And isn’t this a good thing? All of it makes criticism broader, less monolithic, although the power of some negative newspaper reviews can still dent ticket sales. Erskine is a cartoonish archetype of the evil critic, a Mephistophelean figure who is having his portrait drawn for “immortality” (the shadow of Oscar Wilde’s Dorian Gray looms large) and more than a little reminiscent of Addison DeWitt, the manipulative theatre critic in All About Eve. But how evil is he before Nina Land (Gemma Arterton), an actor desperate for his validation, pursues him for praise? We’d certainly consider him a dinosaur nowadays for his personal digs about Nina’s body and his bitching tone. That wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) be allowed. But in essence, there is bald honesty to his savagings of her wooden over-acting. She sees it as cruelty, he as rigour. The love-hate relationship between some actors/writers/directors and critics is well captured. Critics might be seen as charlatans or the devil incarnate until they write a glowing review, and then they become gimlet-eyed truth-tellers. As exaggerated as Erskine is, there is a ruthless honesty to his write-ups at the start of the film which is admirable, and essential for a critic. He has an absolute love of his craft, too. “Theatre is life itself,” he says, and I see his obsessive passion reflected in the best critics around me. His editor commands him to be kinder and this intrusion would rankle any critic today. It is true his verbal assassinations are hurtful. My rule is to express negative opinion in language I would use if the director or actor were in front of me. But Erskine’s style is built on waspish wit and elegantly formed put-downs, legitimate in their own right. The theatre industry may not like it, but some might argue it is its own art. Where the film is at its most instructive is in its warning against the transgressive relationship that forms between Erskine and Land. All About Eve warns against this, too, likening it to a devil’s pact. The Faustian bargain between Erskine and Land is more carnal but it amounts to the same thing: friendship between a critic and an actor is violating a boundary, and it leads Erskine to lose his integrity. If Land lived in the present, she might have sent Erskine an anguished email written at 3am (which critic hasn’t had one of those?) that he could simply have deleted. His fatal mistake is to engage with her out of pity, inviting her to his home, giving her advice on how to do better. Erskine isn’t the first critic to be hounded by an angry actor. I speak from experience. Where reviewers in other art-forms usually remain at a safe distance from those whose work they appraise, theatre reviewers are forced into close proximity every opening night. Any of us can lose our critical distance, maybe even our moral compass, if we cross the line, get too close, start to cheerlead rather than critique. It is, ironically, his initial kindness that leads Erskine to his doom. Graham Greene spoke of a splinter of ice at the heart of every writer. It is the same for the critic, in my view. Erskine shouldn’t have let his melt. A lesson to us all. ‘If you are mealy-mouthed, readers will spot it: if you are honest, you may lose a friend’ Michael Billington How lifelike is the current movie, The Critic? In most respects, it is miles away from the humdrum existence of today’s aisle-squatters. Set in 1934, it conjures up an era when the theatre critic was a journalistic star dictating his reviews – and in those days it was always a man – to an obliging amanuensis: it reminds me of a comment by Joseph Mankiewicz, who created the unforgettable Addison DeWitt in All About Eve, that “critics have acquired all the managerial trappings of performers”. If the movie’s Jimmy Erskine, memorably played by McKellen, is a celebrity, he is also a risk-taking gay man in an age of punitive sexual laws. But, if much has changed since the 1930s, there are moments when the movie expresses a fundamental truth about critics and others when it dwindles into melodrama. Patrick Marber’s Jimmy is loosely derived from a character in Anthony Quinn’s excellent novel, Curtain Call, who in turn was very closely based on James Agate, the Sunday Times theatre critic from 1923 to 1947. It is fair to say that McKellen doesn’t look much like Agate: a chunky figure in a loud-checked overcoat, whom Kenneth Tynan once told me resembled “a suspiciously clean farmer”. But between them Marber and McKellen accurately capture certain aspects of the critic’s life, from the compulsive note-taking to the use of fancy adjectives that irritate sub-editors. The one scene in the film that really resonated, however, was that where Jimmy faces the sack. Suddenly a man who has spent 43 years reviewing theatre is confronted by the prospect of empty evenings and unwanted opinions. Even a lucky beggar like myself, who retired voluntarily and who is still paid to pontificate, can understand what he feels. Theatre-reviewing, as a colleague once remarked, is a drug; and, although I never had to go cold turkey, I still find kindly people sometimes address me with the solicitude normally reserved for addicts in permanent rehab. But ultimately Marber’s script is about the corrupting effect of power and this is where I think it misunderstands the critic’s dilemma. The fictional Jimmy relishes wittily savaging people he doesn’t know. The problem critics face in the real world is the opposite: how to write honestly about people whom they do know. Even though I avoided showbiz after-parties, one can’t live like a monk and I sometimes found myself in the painful position of judging artists I had met socially. If you are mealy-mouthed, readers will spot it: if you are true to your reaction, you may lose a friend. I was never a close chum but for many years I had a genial relationship with Jonathan Miller until I heavily criticised one of his productions and after that he treated me as an enemy. Tom Stoppard, himself a critic in the early 1960s, once wrote, “I never had the moral character to pan a friend. I’ll rephrase that. I had the moral character never to pan a friend.” That, rather than the naked power-hunger displayed in The Critic, is the issue we reviewers face on a regular basis. ‘Critics fraternising with the people they write about is a taboo, a red line, a no-no’ Ryan Gilbey Quentin Tarantino has always been open about his youthful love of film criticism. He studied the reviews of the New Yorker’s Pauline Kael “like class assignments” and even made a fictional film critic one of the heroes of his wartime thriller Inglourious Basterds. Now that Tarantino has abandoned his plans to direct The Movie Critic, about a reviewer on a 1970s porno rag, those of us who make our living judging the work of others will need to look elsewhere for solidarity. Not to The Critic, though. To the common assumption that we are parasites feeding on the failures and triumphs of others, this 1930s-set thriller adds a further insult: we are venal, self-serving ingrates who will stoop to blackmail and murder to cling on to our jobs. Perish the thought! Then again, a movie showing what critics really do in the cause of survival – sharing colleagues’ craven reviews and cockamamie predictions in WhatsApp groups, say, or flogging embarrassing stories about them to Private Eye – wouldn’t look half as dramatic on screen as hounding an enemy to suicide or drowning a blabbermouth in the bathtub. Younger reviewers will marvel at the treatment doled out here to the esteemed drama critic Jimmy Erskine, played by McKellen. On press night, he is tended to by theatre staff, who spirit his coat away and reserve him a quiet space in the bar to collect his thoughts. Even more astonishing is the moment when actor Nina Land (Gemma Arterton), confesses that it was his reviews that first inspired her to tread the boards. Maybe there are budding artists out there today who, like Tarantino or Nina Land, are driven by the critics they read. If so, their ardour will probably be all the more robust for having survived the cultural downgrading of the informed critical voice by aggregate websites and star-ratings, not to mention the skulduggery of studios that have fabricated quotes and/or reviewers to publicise their output. When Jimmy and Nina become friends and co-conspirators, it feels almost as shocking as the grisly turn the plot takes. After all, critics fraternising with the people they write about is a taboo, a red line, a no-no; it is impossible to do without the critical faculties becoming adulterated. Perhaps, then, The Critic is not at all the brickbat it first appears to be, but rather a cautionary tale to help steer modern practitioners away from sycophancy, hyperbole and partiality – a guide to What Not to Do. The downfall of Erskine shows what can happen when the critic drifts away from passionate engagement with an art form and toward serving their own ego or currying favour, either with readers or subjects. It’s a lesson that remains pertinent today. The next time critics insist on tagging the very people they’re praising on social media, listen out for a gentle splashing sound: it’s the tears of Gilbert Adair, Manny Farber and Dilys Powell raining down from heaven."

          "headline": "After success of Labor’s 50c fares, Greens want free public transport for Queensland",
          "bodyText": "Not content with Australia’s cheapest public transport fares, the Queensland Greens have announced they will take a free travel policy to the upcoming state election. The state Labor government had slashed fares to just 50c – no matter the distance – as part of a trial that launched in August. There is now bipartisan support in continuing the fares which have generated a substantial increase in bus and train ridership. The Greens’ transport spokesperson, Michael Berkman, said free transport would save some money by eliminating a contract for ticketing equipment and would increase patronage even further. “We don’t want to see people being pinged and given fines for not having a ticket. Public transport is a public service. It should be free,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The party had previously taken a promise of cheap or free public transport to the 2017 and 2020 state elections. But transport experts expressed scepticism about the free transport policy on Tuesday. Prof Narelle Haworth, a transport researcher from the Queensland University of Technology, said it probably made sense to keep at least small fare in order to generate user data. “I’m not sure that free is much of an advantage over 50c,” she said. A 2021 report by the Estonian National Audit Office concluded that free public transport in capital Tallinn did not achieve its objective of reducing driving. The policy is now being rolled back. Haworth said the research suggests the way to make people switch from driving to using a bus was to improve public transport frequency – but also by discouraging car use. “It’s lack of parking, it’s congestion, it’s all those other things associated with car use that’s more likely to flip people, rather than, necessarily the carrots,” she said. “And that’s why you’ve got such high levels of public transport and so on in places like New York and London and Paris, because a car is a pain. “Brisbane is actually not congested enough.” Berkman said there were other ways to gather data about passenger use and that should not be an impediment for cheaper fares. The party estimates the policy would cost “well under $100m”, cheaper than the $300m cost of 50c fares. “We don’t see why we shouldn’t go a step further and make it genuinely free and make the services useful for people in the regions”. But Steven Miles described the policy as a “thought bubble”. “We’ve delivered almost free public transport right across the state, and it’s been an enormous success,” the premier said. The Greens also announced a policy for improved bus frequency in 26 cities and towns on Tuesday. In Brisbane, 43 bus routes would run every 10 minutes or better, double the 21 that exist today. Similar services would be offered in communities from Cairns to Dalby, under the plan. Robert Dow, the spokesperson for public transport lobby group RAIL Back on Track, said their organisation didn’t support free fares – but backed better bus services. “Increased service frequency is important. That’s one of the big factors that makes our public transport a very poor public transport relative to other jurisdictions,” he said. “Other jurisdictions have frequency. We don’t have it. “Frequency is the main determined to get people to catch public transport.” Berkman said the policy would cost $700m."

          "bodyText": "Sahra Wagenknecht is not even on the ballot in the upcoming state election in Brandenburg. But her face is plastered on billboards across the sprawling, largely rural northern state that surrounds Berlin. There she hopes her fledgling Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) will repeat the successes it enjoyed in polls in Thuringia and Saxony earlier this month, where it came third with vote shares in the double figures, performing so well that it is now a kingmaker for any possible coalition in either state. The centre-right is grappling with how it can keep the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party out of the governments in those two states, where the AfD took more than 30% of the vote in each, coming top in Thuringia. With the latest polls showing the AfD ahead in Brandenburg, the same scenario could be repeated on Sunday. So it is that Wagenknecht, a former communist who once stood on the periphery as a protest politician, has been thrust into the limelight as a core player advocating a distinctive brand of “left conservatism”. And while some see her eponymous alliance as a potential bulwark against the AfD, others point to its anti-migration rhetoric and Russia-friendly foreign policy as reasons to be wary. Acknowledging the power she holds, Franz Josef Wagner, the long-serving columnist of the tabloid Bild, recently referred to her as a “queen of the elections” who could become “Queen of Darkness” or “Queen of Light”, depending on which direction she takes. “I’m pinning my hopes on her,” said Regine Hirsch, 80, a retired chemical laboratory technician, who had left a weekly game of cards with some girlfriends in order to come and hear Wagenknecht speak at the BSW’s first election rally in the riverside city of Brandenburg an der Havel. “Whether everything she says is to be believed, I cannot say,” she said, rubbing her hands against the chill of an autumn breeze. “But I’ve always quite liked her, and anything to keep the Nazis out will be my motto when I go to vote on 22 September,” she added, in reference to the AfD. In a passionate 35-minute address to a crowd of about a thousand people gathered on Brandenburg an der Havel’s market square, Wagenknecht made brief reference to the BSW’s success “from an almost standing start” in Thuringia and Saxony, where governments without it are now almost impossible. Brandenburg voters could ensure a similar result, she said, “and in so doing, send a signal to the unspeakable government in Berlin”, which, she mocked, lived in its own detached capital-city “bubble of organic food shops, lattes and cargo bikes”. Laughter and applause rippled across the square. Then Wagenknecht launched into one of her big campaign themes: Ukraine and the defence policy of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Speaking to the crowd, Wagenknecht derided the government’s decision to cut off supplies of Russian gas, blaming the move for Germany’s cost of living crisis. If she were given the chance, she added, she would push for a diplomatic solution to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She suggested Vladimir Putin was no more of a warmonger than the United States. To many, such claims are deeply disturbing, redolent of reactionary anti-western, anti-Nato propaganda. For the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, the BSW and the AfD are “siblings in spirit” – both populist parties that reject western values. Calling the former “Putinists” and the latter “fascists”, the author said a vote for either was an expression of the ancient proverb “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. “Not since reunification in 1990 is democracy and freedom in such danger as it is now,” he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. In Brandenburg an der Havel, however, the message was going down well with Cornelia Pelzer, a self-employed businesswoman from a nearby town who had travelled to hear Wagenknecht speak. “I’m 150% behind her insistence on pushing for peace,” she said. “She reflects the consciousness of many other Germans on this score, which is why she’s so successful. She’s a complete counterpoint to our war-mongering government,” she added, in reference to the continued military support the government has given to Ukraine. Pelzer said she had long been a Wagenknecht fan and had chosen to follow her when she broke away last year from the leftist Die Linke party – “who were mired in trench warfare” – with a band of her supporters to form the BSW. Manfred Köhler, 67, who spent 45 years as a shift worker at the local steelworks, admitted he was unconvinced by Wagenknecht and was more likely to vote for the AfD. “But I live in hope that her lot, despite what they say, and the AfD will band together,” he said, sitting on the edge of a flower bed and drawing on a cigarette after the rally. Wagenknecht has, like the established parties, ruled out a coalition between her party and the anti-migration, anti-Islam AfD, although she has been less insistent about refusing any cooperation whatsoever, suggesting the two could work together where their party programmes align. She has been eager to show empathy towards AfD supporters in the hope of luring them to her BSW, saying many chose to vote for the party “not because they’re far-right but because they are furious”. Obvious overlapping goals include limiting migration, increasing the deportations of rejected asylum seekers and tightening controls at Germany’s borders (a step already taken by the government on Monday). Wagenknecht has said Berlin needs to send the message to the world that “Germany is overwhelmed, Germany doesn’t have any more room, Germany is no longer prepared to be destination number one”. Köhler said that, as a Brandenburg voter, overwrought public services, a lack of integration and security were among his main concerns. “My granddaughter is in the second year of school and over half the class is not able to speak German,” he said. “All I know is that this situation can’t continue, and that the established parties have to be ousted.” But did he trust parties that had never before held positions of political responsibility? “If they’re no good, they’ll be out after five years,” he said. “But you have to give them a chance. They can’t do any worse than the current lot. And you can’t label me a Nazi for suggesting it. That’s a cheap shot – that was 85 years ago.”"

          "bodyText": "RFU, PRL, PGP, PRB, IDP, TNT, CVC, RPA – drowning in alphabet soup yet? Welcome to English rugby’s new frontier, where it seems there is no problem too big that an acronym cannot solve. Given the addition of a few more over the summer, maybe it is not complete coincidence that Premiership directors of rugby were recently given a lesson in language. It is said they were all called into a meeting room and encouraged to be more strident in their public views for the coming season. To embrace and celebrate the gladiatorial nature of the sport, rather than shy away from it. In short, to sex things up a bit. It is believed one wag raised the point that the Rugby Football Union has a habit of hitting him in his wallet whenever he speaks his mind but the recently agreed professional game partnership (PGP) has, so we are told, ushered in an era of unprecedented collaboration between club and country, so you would hope for some leniency by the disciplinary department. The point here is that the Premiership season finally kicks off on Friday, five weeks after the Premier League, with an acute awareness that the battle for eyeballs has never been greater. France’s Top 14 began last week to great fanfare with a litany of well-known England stars on show, stealing a march on the Premiership, where most players have not had any competitive action since May. The salary cap has gone back up to £6.4m but the majority of clubs are choosing not to spend to the limit and, though the appointment of Michael Cheika as Leicester’s head coach promises to be box office, the days of clubs recruiting A-list overseas stars are long gone. The arrival of the Fiji captain, Waisea Nayacalevu, at Sale may be the exception that proves the rule but across the board clubs have released considerably more players than they have signed. By a recent count there were 37 players without a club, having been let go at the end of last season, and though it is an inevitable consequence of a 10-team Premiership – and so fewer fixtures – squads have shrunk. If it means members of the England Under-20s side who won the Junior World Cup over the summer get the game time that they are often starved of, all the better, but it will not be the allure of watching overseas stars that sells tickets this season. It is also a consequence of the continued post-pandemic recovery at a time when government bailouts are still expected to be repaid and the financial landscape is such that a club such as Harlequins, who sold out all but two of last season’s home matches and who take two fixtures a year to Twickenham with great success, consider being within £500,000 of breaking even a reason for optimism. As the outgoing Northampton chief executive, Mark Darbon, puts it: “We and the other clubs are striving for this financially sustainable model and lots of us are making good progress but we are not yet profitable on a P&amp;L basis, consistently. That feels like a bit of a step away so we’ve got to continue to work really hard to ensure that we’ve a model that can thrive in the future. Otherwise we’re going to see challenges that we’ve seen in recent years with the loss of some clubs.” With most clubs cutting their cloth accordingly it has made for an ultra competitive Premiership – so much so that it is now the league’s selling point. But if the clubs have stabilised since three of their number went to the wall, there is an awareness of the need for growth. Extending the title sponsorship deal with Gallagher for another three years is a positive development but that need explains the language lesson and the promise from TNT Sports to push boundaries this season. “We’ve got to continue to grow the audience, grow its appeal,” adds Darbon. “Only then can we monetise that proposition, can we get media and broadcasting companies investing properly to help us sustain things into the future. We need the broadcasters to want to invest in our sport because there’s an audience that follows it, we need major corporate partners investing at league level because they want to be involved in the Premiership.” The TNT deal was renewed earlier this year for another two seasons but at a reduced price, which has further focused minds across Premiership boardrooms. It also explains why talk of Anglo-Welsh and British &amp; Irish leagues continues to bubble away, all the more so when the Champions Cup has moved to Premier Sports because TNT didn’t see value in keeping it – a decision that some insiders consider the death knell for the once-vaunted competition. It has been a long-held view at the RFU that the best way to grow the club game is to have a successful England team. The union’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, often laments how England have won the Six Nations just four times since lifting the World Cup in 2003, and only one grand slam, and the RFU is unashamed in its aims for the PGP, which gives Steve Borthwick more control over a select group of players. “Anyone looking in at the age profile, the type of profile of this England team, the growth that’s in that team at the moment, the players that are potentially coming into that England team, is only looking at it and going: ‘England is only going one way,’” says the RFU’s Conor O’Shea. “The proof will always be on the pitch, and we have to deliver that, but the agreement allows us to deliver it on a consistent basis.” That view is mirrored in the Premiership, if not quite as enthusiastically. “It’s a better agreement for the progression of the international game and that’s what brings in the majority of support, resources and finance into the game,” says Sale’s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson. “[But] it’s definitely more intrusive around how I’m able to manage those players.” Rob Baxter, the Exeter director of rugby, has voiced his concerns about the PGP but has been enthused by subsequent conversations with Borthwick. Whether it will transform the English landscape for the better remains to be seen, however. “I didn’t get the impression it was bad before,” says Baxter. “The most important thing rugby can do is to stop changing every time it thinks it needs to change. “Post-Covid salary caps went down, they’ve only just returned now. People even now are talking about whether it should go back up, the RFU are always talking that they haven’t got enough money, they didn’t support the clubs through Covid at all, which is one of my bugbears. Now to get a bit of extra money clubs have got to give up more control. It doesn’t sound like a completely aligned game in this country and that’s probably how it’s going to feel for a little bit.” Ultimately, whether the PGP realises the RFU’s objectives comes down to Borthwick. For all the granular detail contained in the agreement, for all the individual development plans (IDPs) laid out for his players, how he manages relationships with clubs to ensure he gets best use of his players without turning directors of rugby against him will be key. “I had a good relationship with Eddie [Jones] and I do with Steve now,” says Sanderson of the previous and current England head coaches. “I’m not going to get on with everyone all the time and when those disagreements occur it’s going to be the player caught in the middle. If Steve isn’t there and I don’t get on with the next England head of rugby, that’s my concern.” The hope is that, at the very least, it no longer becomes an unattractive proposition for clubs to have a number of England internationals in their ranks and the exodus to France slows. That Premiership matches no longer clash with Test weekends helps but the maximum appearances a player can make has been reduced to 30, meaning clubs will have to factor in planning when to rest their internationals even before Borthwick tries to tell them precisely when. Then there is next summer’s British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia. There are no strictly mandated player welfare limits for those players selected – a worry because there are an extra 10 matches bolted on to the end of the season – but perhaps of greater concern is the Wallabies’ recent form. It does not lend itself to the kind of narrative that Lions tours need to thrive – that of a newly assembled squad heading to the end of the earth to tackle one of the world’s leading Test sides against the odds. Selection for the tour will loom over the entire season, starting at the Rec on Friday as Bath host Northampton. Will Andy Farrell fancy Finn Russell as his fly-half? Perhaps Fin Smith, 22 but able to play with an authority beyond his years, can usurp him. More pressingly, it is said that ticket sales for Friday’s curtain raiser are slow, which is a concern given the Rec is normally a popular place to be under the Friday night lights, all the more so given it is a rerun of last season’s final. It offers Bath the chance for some early revenge for their four-point defeat in June, having had Beno Obano sent off in the 21st minute for a dangerous tackle. Whether that sending-off ruined the contest or took Bath to within a whisker of what would have gone down as one of the most famous victories in recent memory is open to debate but it does the sport no favours that the Premiership final, the Champions Cup final and the World Cup final all featured red cards last season. To the letter of the law they were all correct decisions but none were for acts of flagrant violence. Instead they punished marginal mistakes in an era of zero tolerance against the backdrop of concussion litigation and at a time when prioritising safety as well as the spectacle is an increasingly difficult task. If only there was an acronym for it."

          "bodyText": "In April 1966, according to legend, a chance encounter in a traffic jam on Sunset Boulevard led to the formation of the rock group Buffalo Springfield. They took their name from a steamroller built by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company, whose factory was located in Springfield, Ohio. In a brief career, they produced some great music, including one all-time classic, the protest song For What It’s Worth. Two of its members, Neil Young and Stephen Stills, went on to superstardom. And that was the 15 minutes of fame for the town of Springfield … until a few days ago, when Donald Trump relaunched it into the spotlight, and prompted a thousand memes, by asserting in the presidential debate with Kamala Harris that the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield were abducting dogs and cats from their neighbours and eating them. For some of us, this was the highlight of the debate – who needs policy with this quality of anecdote? It reminded me of one of the most arresting opening sentences in modern literature, from master of dystopia JG Ballard’s High-Rise: “Later, as he sat on his balcony eating his dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months.” And it is of course untrue: the Springfield mayor has said there is zero evidence of this culinary trend. But for committed Trump supporters, they will believe it, whatever the evidence to the contrary, because they want it to be so. It fits perfectly with the nightmarish image of America that Trump has been peddling for decades and that his supporters share: remember, in his 2016 inauguration speech, his description of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”. The 2024 Trump is a less formidable campaigner than the 2016 model – down on energy, more liable to become confused, and with a mind cluttered with grievances. And he remains a policy-free zone. But he is still capable of connecting with the “left behind” to a level few can match, a talent which ensures a devoted support base in a country where one in three workers say they live “paycheck to paycheck”. Harris has attempted, with some success, and despite her three-and-a-half years as vice-president, to run as the “change candidate”. She has presented herself as a beacon of hope and positivity, in contrast to Trump’s Dantesque vision. The Democratic Convention was a bubble of happy talk and liberal-flavoured optimism. She bossed the recent debate, aided by an opponent with the message discipline of a wasp at a picnic. Some of the baits she dangled in front of Trump were so obvious that they almost materialised under the studio lights: yet he swallowed every one. So she’s going to win? Not so fast: the polls say it’s a toss-up (historically they’ve underestimated Trump’s support) and the Democrats risk making two serious mistakes. The first of these relates to the peculiar nature of US democracy, with elections decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote. Few states are real competitions: the majority are nailed-on for the Democrats or the Republicans. And three of the battleground states are critical: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all once part of the manufacturing heartland of America, all now relegated to the declining rust belt. In 2016, Trump won them by about 70,000 votes. In 2020, Biden won them back. In 2024, they may again determine the outcome. The Democrats need to be laser-focused on these voters. Trump is telling them their jobs have gone overseas or to illegal immigrants because Washington doesn’t care: but he offers no policy solutions beyond the widely derided proposition of tariffs on imports. This offers Harris an opportunity. But in the debate, when asked about the economy, she generalised and deflected. She must do better, offering some crisply worded, specific, targeted policies to bring jobs and hope back to these blighted neighbourhoods. Otherwise they may drift back to Trump. And second, Harris must stop hiding from the media. Back in 2016, Trump was ever-present. He would accept any and every invitation. He would, even unbidden, phone the morning news shows to offer his views. By contrast, Hillary Clinton locked the media out – and lost. Harris seems to have adopted the Clinton playbook, with just one 20-minute interview since becoming the Democrat candidate. She needs to take some risks, especially with supposedly hostile media outlets such as Fox News; it’s about contesting the space, and the audience, that Trump currently dominates. Finally, how should the UK behave during these 51 remaining days until 5 November? Starmer was in the White House two days ago, and given the political alignment between Labour and the Democrats, it is no surprise that he and Biden seem already to have bonded. There was even talk of Harris breaking into her campaign schedule to drop into the White House meeting – though in the event this didn’t happen. But Starmer will be back in the US at the end of September for the UN general assembly: might he meet Harris then? It would obviously be valuable to meet the possible future president. However – as I am sure the British embassy in Washington are advising – it is important that if Starmer meets one, he meets both, even if this means taking time out from the UN to connect with Trump. It will be noticed and resented by the Trump team if he doesn’t. There is a lot to discuss with him, starting with his views on Ukraine. And however badly Trump performed in the debate, however visible his personal decline, he remains for many of us the likelier winner. Lord Darroch was British ambassador to the US from 2016 to 2019"

          "headline": "Strictly Come Dancing: the launch show – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Very much appreciated your company and sage comments during this curtain-raiser, everyone. Let’s reconvene right here for the first live show, which starts at 7pm next Saturday. In the meantime, I’m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so do come and say hello. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, Guardian glitterati. And, it almost goes without saying, keeeeeep dancing! Night. No mention of The Great Unpleasantness, which was perhaps no surprise, nor references to the show’s new welfare measures. Perhaps we’ll see that more when the training rooms come into play over the coming weeks. Instead this was a launch show which definitely tried to put the fun back into Strictly. Lots of bright colours, camaraderie and start-of-new-school term excitement. A soft reboot. If you’d somehow missed all the scandal this summer, you probably wouldn’t have noticed much difference – bar a couple of mysteriously absent male pros. Strictly is back and after several months of relentless scrutiny, it felt good to be reminded of its joys again. Maybe we are allowed nice things after all. Gardener Maidhc says: “Team MoJo already look to be living up to the potential.” Aine183 says: “Chris McCausland does have rhythm. I am crossing my fingers for him.” And finally, RegWhelk adds: “Well, that was an interesting, if over-stimulated, start to the series. Loving Chris and Annoyah, but I think Sarah might be the one to watch.” whistledownthewind says: “Despite all the problems, Strictly at its best is still one of the most entertaining things on TV. Here’s hoping the biggest scandal this season is the amount of Just For Men beard dye Craig has on his face!” Pancake01 adds: “Craig looks like a long-lost Windsor. Uncle Craig, who had to be exiled Down Under for kicking a corgi.” emilyscatnaps says: “Amidst all the drama, it’s good to know we can still rely on certain things: - Claud and Tess look A-MAY-ZING - Tess’s one shoulder outfits - Dave Arch and The Wunnerfuls bringing it.” On Chris McCausland’s quip about the modern-day miracle of getting in the same room as a doctor, SecretPuddleJumper says: “Ha, the HIGNFY and Strictly crossover I never knew I needed. No going back now.” Strictlygirl06 says: “I love these pairings! Chris and Dianne is so perfect.” Pancakeo1 agrees: “I like Dianne with Chris. Katya and Wynne should be good too. It seems to be more about fun so far, which I think it’s what they are aiming for. fihema says: “I think I know five of the celebs. Nice to see Amy in her own Marilyn/Madonna/Ken choreo with Nikita in a kilt (grin). This is the pink ribbon in human form.” davidargile says: “Aww, fantastic Amy is back. Things like this and Chris, highlight what Strictly is all about, not the summer shenanigans and media frenzy. I for one am glad it’s back on our screens.” A swift round-up of some wise words from the glitter gang down below. GreatIsMyNewt says: “So Shayne and Nancy = Shancey? Too early?” In other nickname news, ReclinedPotato says: “I see your Shancey and raise you with Petita.” Pete and Jowita, obv. Early days, obviously, but on this evidence, who do we think might dance deep into the contest? I liked the look of Tasha Ghouri, Jamie Borthwick, Sarah Hadland, Montell Douglas and Shayne Ward. Paul Merson, Chris McCausland, Nick Knowles and Toyah Willcox should be fun to watch. The field is full of intriguing pairings. Are they enough to help the Strictly “brand” bounce back? TV viewers can now stay on BBC1 for Last Night of the Proms, flip to BBC2 for music compilation Songs of Survival or, in a sly piece of scheduling, Channel 5 is airing documentary Strictly Come Dancing: Secrets, Sex &amp; Scandals. Film-wise, just starting are The Northman on Channel 4 or Notting Hill on Film4. Altogether now: I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her… A closing card pays tribute to former Strictly favourites Dave Myers and Robin Windsor. Classy touch. RIP. “Staaaaaart dancing,” trill Tess and Claud. As the glitter confetti settles and the newly formed couples waltz off to the training rooms, their new chaperones in hot pursuit, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Phew. Pick the bones out of that, sparkly squadron. Wynne Evans looks like he could be a Welsh Ed Balls. Up for fun. Respectable hip action from Pete Wicks. Dad dancers Wynne Evans, Nick Knowles and Paul Merson relying on comedy factor at this early stage, doing more pose-striking than dancing. Sarah Hadland seems to be dressed as a Ribena berry that’s gone to Las Vegas but looks great. It’s crayon-coloured pandemonium out there. They’re back in primary coloured outfits, like a Skittles-fuelled fever dream. The song is 1980 disco anthem Dance Yourself Dizzy by Liquid Gold. Tasha Ghouri leading the charge and almost looks like a pro already. Cynics might grumble that with her prior hoofing experience, she kind of is. Shayne Ward, JB Gill, Montell Douglas and Jamie Borthwick also look promising. Chris McCausland giving it some welly and surprisingly decent. As per annual tradition, we finish the launch show with all 15 celebrities and 18 pros cramming onto the dancefloor for a slightly chaotic group routine. Pay close attention, we’re about to get our first look at the new crop’s hoofing abilities. So our Strictly 2024 line-up is complete. Thoughts? Feelings? Fears? Early favourites? (That’s probably enough questions for now.) Paul Merson is thrilled to be paired with the longest-serving pro, Venezuelan-born firecracker Karen Hauer. “I’m well happy,” grins the ex-Gooner. “You’ve put the two oldest together. And I’m one of them!” Karen says: “I just want him to enjoy himself because this is one of the greatest experiences.” She then announces that their first dance will be an American smooth to Vindaloo by Fat Les. Scarily, I don’t think she’s joking. It will be a Strictly first, if nothing else. Eng-land! Nick Knowles is paired with Russian-born pro Luba Mushtuk. “We’ll be a good match,” says Nick. “I wanted someone patient. She’s a world-class dancer, so how can it possibly go wrong? Although, it’s a bit like taking an F1 world champion and putting them in a beaten-up old builder’s van. I have had a bit of bodywork done, though. A spray paint, literally.” Luba said: “I’m pretty sure with some time and a lot of practice, I will make you into a Maserati.” We seem to have accidentally changed channels to Top Gear. And on that bombshell… They were always likely to put the big ’uns together. Tom Dean, who stands 6ft 4in, is paired with Nadiya Bychkova, the tallest female pro. Go easy on his tootsies because Tom says: “We don’t do any land stuff, so I’ve never really gone against gravity in my sporting career. Running, jumping and twisting are all totally new to me, so I’m trying to build up strength in these delicate feet of mine.” Better stock up on Dr Scholl products and Body Shop peppermint foot lotion. (Other brands are available.) Nadiya says: “I’m super happy. He’s not just a swimmer, he’s a winner!” Nice to see Ukrainian pro Nadiya back in the main cast after being benched last year. Adorable home video footage of tiny Tom doing ballet in boyhood. He’s a ringer! Kidding. And finally of our famous 15, it’s this year’s youngest contestant: Olympic swimmer Tom Dean. He goofed in July by accidentally announcing himself as the first participant, blurting it out poolside in Paris. The chlorine had clearly gone to his head. Send out a DIY SOS. It’s toolbox-wielding TV presenter Nick Knowles. Former footballer Paul Merson is the next squad member to come off the sequin-spangled bench. Who will be man-marking Merse the magic man? Choreographic accompaniment comes from pros Jowita Przystał, Lauren Oakley, Kai Widdrington and Carlos Gu. The later three have been benched this series, meaning they have no celebrity partner. Instead they will be ensemble dancers and provide injury cover. A shame, especially in Kai’s case. Their hit Symphony soundtracked Rose and (whisper his name) Giovanni’s Couple’s Choice in 2021, complete with its spine-tingling silent interlude. Now electro-classical crossover band Clean Bandit are in the ballroom, joined by Essex popstrel Anne-Marie to perform their new single Cry Baby, produced by David “heart hands behind the decks” Guetta. This is Clean Bandit’s third collaboration with Anne-Marie and the song started life in 2020, written remotely over Zoom during lockdown. You can almost taste the banana bread and hear the doorstep clapping. Dr Punam Krishan is paired with Spanish pro Gorka Márquez, who Claudia reminds us has scored more 10s than any other pro currently on the show. Punam says: “I’m absolutely buzzing. I feel honoured, because you’ve got so many years of experience. I can’t wait to take you up north to bonnie Scotland.” Gorka the Corker gamely replies: “I can’t wait. I love Glasgow and I love haggis.” Neeps and tatties with that, McGorka? Well, he needed a promising partner upon his Strictly comeback and he’s got one. Tasha Ghouri is paired with smiley Slovenian pro Aljaž Škorjanec “Dance is my pure joy,” gushes Tasha. “It’s where I found my inner confidence and I’m doing this for all the Tashas out there. Disability or not, it’s about celebrating dance and putting smiles on faces. That’s what I’m here for. I am absolutely ecstatic to be paired with Aljaž. He’s so fun. I love a bit of chaos energy. We mesh so well. He’s already teaching me little move. I’ve got a good one here.” Aljaž adds: “Enjoy and embrace every single step of it because it’s the most special show you could ever do.” Welcome back, Mr Manrara. Sarah Hadland is paired with reigning pro champion Vito Coppola. A couple that could go a long way. “I’m a Strictly superfan,” says Sarah. “I’d be taking it very seriously if I was at home. Depending on which WhatsApp group I was with, you wouldn’t be able to talk during the dances. That’s a very strict rule.” Much like Liveblog Towers, Sarah. Ahem. When Claudia ask Vito if he can win again, he says: “I live in the moment and the present. Sarah and me have the same energy. I see Sarah as sparkling water. We are going to live this journey as a bubble!” So that’s totally clear, then. Toyah Willcox is partnered with homegrown pro Neil Jones. She says: “I met Neil and I was in heaven. All of you are beautiful boys but not as beautiful as Neil!” On Toyah’s plans to be “the first pensioner to abseil through this studio”, Neil says: “I’m scared of heights but I’m up for it.” Good to see the carrot-topped cult hero get a partner after two years on the bench. Sarah Hadland makes everyone laugh with a reference to “slow growers” (cheeky) and shows off her reaction face to Craig criticism. Such fun. Bear with, bear with. Our last celebrity female is Miranda Hart’s best mate Stevie, aka actor Sarah Hadland. Time for our youngest celebrity female, Love Island alumna and disability campaigner Tasha Ghouri. Who happens to be an ex-girlfriend of jettisoned pro Giovanni Pernice. Spicy. As Strictly’s second ever deaf contestant, she’s bidding to follow in the footsteps of glitterball winner Rose Ayling-Ellis. And judging by her dance pedigree, don’t rule it out. The doctor will see you now. Next into the Elstree waiting room is media medic Dr Punam Krishan, who is the resident health expert on Morning Live, as well as a practising NHS GP. Which pro will be experiencing her bedside manner? Let’s get back to the pairing up. Who will 80s pop-punk popstrel Toyah Willcox be paired with? For now, it’s a mystery. Afterwards, Ellie gives this year’s contestants some words of wisdom: “Take in every minute, it goes so fast, so enjoy it, guys. It’s the best time ever.” Welcome back, 2023 glitterball winners. Reigning champions Ellie Leach and Vito Coppola are back in the ballroom, reprising their fiery, rave-tinged paso doble to 2WEI’s stripped-back cover of Insomnia by Faithless and reminding us exactly why they won nine months ago. When they first performed it in week five, Motsi hailed it as “the best dance of the series so far”. Vito was thrilled with Shirley recognising their fregolina steps, which baffled Claudia up on the balcony. They scored their first 10 and Ellie accidentally bashed Vito in the teeth with sheer excitement. It was also their Judges’ Pick in the grand final, where they increased their score from 37 to 39 points (no prizes for guessing which judge declined to raise his perfect 10 paddle). JB Gill is paired with much-loved Welsh pro Amy Dowden, making her Strictly comeback after recovering from cancer. Amy says: “I’m delighted to be back in the ballroom. It feels like my first year all over again. I just want JB to have the best time and fall in love with dancing.” JB admits he had his sights set on Amy as his professional partner,: “She’s brilliant, plus she’s got experience with popstars, so I know I’m in good hands!” He means Tom Fletcher from McFly, who she partnered in 2021. Sam Quek will be partnered by Ukrainian pro Nikita Kuzmin, who reached last year’s final with Layton Williams. He also came runner-up in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year. Sam says: “I’ve never felt nerves like it. It’s the unknown. Look at me, this isn’t me. I didn’t recognise myself in the mirror!” “Everybody spoke of Sam so well,” says Nikita. “She’s so lovely and she’s so caring, I cannot wait to start.” Another couple who could go far. Montell Douglas is paired with popular South African pro Johannes Radebe. Lucky her. Montell says: “How can you not be happy? I don’t think there’s a person on this earth who doesn’t want to be partnered with Jojo. I’m over the moon!” And they’ve already coined a team name. “Strictly Come Dancing, bringing the MoJo,” says Johannes. “She’s Fire and I’m Water.” He’s been on a hot streak in recent years, reaching the final with John Whaite and the semi-final with Annabel Croft. MoJo rising indeed. Pete Wicks is coupled up with Polish pro Jowita Przystał who won with wildlife presenter Hamza Yassin two years ago. Asked by Claudia if having Jowita by his side makes it all worthwhile, Pete replies: “Oh, 100%! The little pocket rocket? I’ve got this in the bag now, I’m going to win it.” Jowita reveals that their first dance will be a paso doble to The Prodigy’s Breathe. Pete looks puzzled and asks: “What’s a paso doble?” Don’t be fooled. I think they could be dark horses. Time for a Quekstep, as Olympian-turned-TV presenter Sam Quek prepares to find out who’ll be playing jolly hockeysticks with. Mewwy Cwistmas! The next celebrity into the sparkly sorting hat is JB Gill from boyband JLS. The only way is spray tan. It’ll soon be the turn of TOWIE alumnus and reality TV rent-a-face Pete Wicks to meet his professional partner. Who’ll be trying to tame the lionine bad boy? Over to the female celebrities now and first up is Montell Douglas, he Olynpic athlete who’s now on Gladiators as “Fire”. Gladiator ready? Pro partner ready? You will go on my first whistle… Play the doof-doofs! Jamie Borthwick, aka Jay Mitchell from EastEnders is paired with Cypriot pro and Latin champion Michelle Tsiakka in her first series with a celebrity partner. Jay says: “I don’t quite know how I managed to win the Christmas special but this is a whole different ballgame. I don’t think I can blag it for a whole 13 weeks.” Michelle adds “It’s a dream come true to finally get on that dancefloor with a partner and who better than Jamie to dance with? I’m so happy!” Ones to watch, I reckon. He won the Christmas special and she’ll be keen to impress in her debut series proper. A promising pairing, not to be confused with Sid and Nancy. Shayne Ward says: “Nancy is a phenomenal dancer and I feel so blessed that she’s with me on this journey. On matching Shayne’s competitive spirit, Nancy Xu says: “I will try. Since that’s your goal, that’s my goal!” X Factor winner Shayne will face the music and dance. Who’s the more intimidating judge, do we reckon? Simon Cowell or Craig Revel Horwood? Wynne Evans is paired with St Petersburg-born pro Katya Jones, a former glitterball winner who was a semi-finalist with Nigel Harman last year. Wynne calls her “the cockney Russian!” Katya says: “This man was born to Wynne!” and reveals that their first dance will be the samba to Help Yourself by Sir Tom Jones. Hip action ahoy. Anton mops his brow with relief that it’s not him. This should be a highly entertaining couple. Chris McCausland is paired with Aussie pro Dianne Buswell, who reached the final last year with Bobby Brazier. Chris quips: “She is absolutely over the moon having me because she really wants November off. You’ve got a holiday booked, haven’t you?” Dianne says: “I’m so excited and honoured to be your partner.I’m not sure myself how it’s going to work but we’ll figure it out together.” Chris replies: “We’re going to make mistakes and have a laugh about them. Then we’re going to turn up here and show you all of the mistakes that we’ve learnt.” Her fellow pros crowd around to embrace her emotionally at the end and lift her shoulder high. Lovely moment. I might have something in my eye. It’s set to a dance-pop medley, climaxing with Jungle’s Keep Moving. Jazzy styling. Elements of tango, Charleston and quickstep. A classic Strictly number. Frothy and fab-ew-lous. Amy takes centre stage in a hot pink feathered dress. She’s making a cheering return to the ballroom after being forced to pull out of last year’s series as she battled stage three breast cancer. Now Strictly celebrates the happy return of popular pro Amy Dowden with a show-stopping group number. Gio Compario in funny shocker. Wynne Evans is quite amusing. Who knew? Chris McCausland quips that he’s “only here for three weeks”. First into the mirrorball breach is comedian Chris McCausland, Strictly’s first ever blind contestant. When he was confirmed as part of the line-up, Chris said: “What could possibly go wrong? OK, don’t answer that. If anybody out there is thinking ‘How the hell will that work?’, rest assured that I’m thinking exactly the same thing. I just hope the BBC can afford the insurance. I’ll take out three cameras per week.” But who’ll be his glittery guide? Pete Wicks seems to be wearing my nan’s old net curtains. Bring on 15 frightened deers in the headlights. Lots of pastel-hued pleather. Toyah Willcox of 80s punk-pop fame! Nick Knowles of hard-hat and hi-vis tabard fame! Jay from EastEnders! The GoCompare bloke! Teeny poppers Shayne Ward and JB from JLS! Blind comedian Chris McCausland! Some slightly obscure sportspeople! The casting department threw darts at the phone directory, didn’t they? Tess reveals that Craig has awarded 10 scores of one in the past two decades. And six of them went to Anton. Aaaaaand we welcome the paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and head judge Shirley Ballas. Craig looks rther dashing with his new beard. Sort of salty sea dog meet Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. The long-serving Strictly bandleader is back, complete with his baton and slightly sheepish look to the camera. Here come our presenting pair, so time for our first fashion face-off of the series. Tess Daly is is in silver asymmetric with sash. Claudia Winkleman is in a white tuxedo with matching Essex girl stilletos. Claud wins but what a treat to see them both. It’s been a hot minute. This is terribly high-concept. Unless I’m mistaken, it’s soundtracked by a Vengaboys medley, Technotronic, 2 Unlimited, Whigfield, Gina G and Steps. Retro. Gorka’s got his shirt off. Nice nod to dear old Brucey with the bus numberplate. And finally, the action moves into the ballroom Barbie Movie-style primary coloured outfits all round. Cameos from the judges and presenters. Claudia clearly LOVED telling Dave Arch she loves him. No new-look title sequence yet. That has to wait until after the pairings are announced. Instead we start the series in style with a spectacular routine from the professional troupe, encouraging us to get aboard the Strictly Bus. It’s got tiger-print seats and everything. Take your sofa seats and charge your glasses, glitterati. We’re about to go over to the Elstree Studios ballroom for the first time this year. Squeal! Last knockings of name-that-pop-tune gameshow The Hit List on BBC1 now. Hurry up, the Humeses, we’ve got Latin and ballroom pairings to unveil… How are we feeling about this year’s celebrity line-up? For me, it lacked a big name or three - but we often think that before the series starts and within weeks, such gripes are forgotten and we’re fully invested. Here’s my initial reaction when the cast was announced. Mere minutes now until showtime… Shortest show until November, anyone? With a running time of a tight 100 minutes, tonight’s launch show is the briefest we’ll get for a good few weeks, until the 15-strong field is whittled down. Next week’s first live show is an epic 145 minutes. These early weeks are a real test of sparkly stamina. Ten minutes now until choreographic kick-off… The main business tonight, of course, is the pro-celebrity pairings being unveiled. But we’re also promised one last one last go around the floor for reigning champions Ellie and Vito, a musical performance from Clean Bandit featuring Anne-Marie, plus several group numbers. Just 15 minutes until sequin o’clock…. As is traditional, here’s your weekly spotter’s guide to things we’re likely to see on-screen each week. Tick them off! Take a drink for each! Celebrate Strictly being back, back, back! Comeback pros Amy Dowden and Aljaž Škorjanec don’t stop grinning for the entire episode Shirley and Anton are billed as “Queen of Latin” and “King of Ballroom” respectively. Poor Motsi doesn’t get a regal title Craig Revel Horwood is on jolly form, which will all change next week when his scoring paddles come out There’s a pro you don’t recognise because they’re always on the subs’ bench/have grown a beard/had a haircut Reigning champion Ellie Leach advises this year’s cast to “enjoy the journey” Sarah Hadland and Toyah Wilcox look exactly the same, which could get confusing Male celeb is “looking forward to being Strictlyfied”. The next time we seem him, he’s several shades more orange Ginger Neil elbows his way to the front of a group shot Obvi-gag about Nick Knowles sending out a “Dance SOS”/Wynne Evans “go comparing” his footwork Claudia Winkleman mentions how she’s missing Krishnan Guru-Murthy’s son Jay All the negative press didn’t dent Strictly’s popularity at this week’s viewer-voted National TV Awards. Claudia and Tess picked up the Best Talent Show prize on behalf of the show and were so delighted, they conga-danced off the stage. Gloria Estefan would approve. It will be intriguing go see how events of recent months affect the show. New welfare measures have been introduced, including welfare producers for both the celebrities and pros. A member of the production team will be present at all times in the training rooms. There has been speculation that the scandals might have affected the show’s casting process. The new series has the lowest percentage of female celebrities in Strictly’s 20-year history, with just six women out of 15. To replace the departing pro pair, it was announced in July that Aljaž Škorjanec would be returning after a two-year hiatus. He’s a fan favourite and family man who is seen as a safe pair of hands. What other differences might be made by this tumultuous period? BBC director general Tim Davie has said the show should be more fun and less competitive. Will the ballroom curtain now be pulled back to embrace any drama, reveal the truth behind the feelgood platitudes and be open about exactly how hard the Strictly process can be? Will chaperones disrupt the dynamic and rapport between the couples? Will the controversy be explicitly mentioned on-air in tonight’s show? Has the glitterball lost its shine? I guess we’ll get our first clues shortly. It’s been an annus horribilis so far for the BBC’s flagship entertaining franchise. The controversy was kickstarted by actress Amanda Abbington, who departed the last series early amid rumours of clashes with her professional partner Giovanni Pernice - a former glitterball winner, four-time finalist and one of the top pros. Early this year, Abbington made a complaint that she’d been subjected to “inappropriate, mean, nasty bullying” and had suffered mild PTSD as a result. In June, it was confirmed that after “numerous serious complaints” regarding his teaching methods, thought to include testimony from some of his previous dance partners, Pernice would not be returning to the show. Pernice denied “any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour”. A BBC investigation is still ongoing. Since her complaint was made public, police have looked into death threats allegedly made against Abbington and her family. Later that month, despite initially being confirmed for this series, it was announced that Pernice’s fellow Italian pro Graziano Di Prima wouldn’t be returning either, following allegations of misconduct towards his own 2023 partner, Love Islander Zara McDermott. Di Prima said he “deeply regretted his actions that led to his departure”, which included kicking McDermott in training. He reportedly ended up “under medical supervision and had “ugly thoughts” about suicide. As the crisis deepened and vultures began to circle, further stories swirled about pros’ teaching methods and behind-the-scenes behaviour, some going back years. Ex-contestant Rev Richard Coles said “no one was surprised” in an “intensely competitive show with a dark heart”. Accusations of bullying and abuse hit Strictly particularly hard, since they undermine its inclusive, supportive, wholesome, family-friendly image. The fallout even led to speculation that the series might be taken off-air this year. However, the show must go on and we’re back in the ballroom tonight. You can read more about it all in our articles here and here. …And almost as importantly, our first sequin-spangled liveblog of the year. Good evening all and welcome to the 22nd series of Strictly Come Dancing. I’m Michael, your virtual dance partner in Strictly’s landmark 20th year. I hope you’ll join me for a celebratory autumn of twinkle-toed communal viewing. Tonight’s pre-recorded launch show sees our 15 intrepid new celebrities paired up with their professional partners. This is followed by our first chance to check out their hoofing potential as everyone hits the fabled Elstree Studios floor for the traditional curtain-raising group number. It promises to be the usual chaotic cocktail of dad-dancing, disco moves and mugging for the camera. You don’t need me to remind you that this is a momentous series for the BBC’s ballroom behemoth. So far its 20th anniversary has been overshadowed by a string of scandals that left the show in crisis - and even, for a while back there, its future in doubt. More on that shortly. Tonight is our first chance to see if the choreographic contest can keep its all-important sparkle. It’s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6.45pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and affectionate snark. So dig your dancing shoes out of deep storage and see you on the sofa. Strictly season is upon us again. Before we know it, it’ll be Christmas. I’d love to hear from you, too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for cha-cha-chat. I’ll rumba-walk down there every now and again to say hi and gauge your reaction to the show, so please share your thoughts. Are we ready to set the glitterball spinning again? Nearly time to staaaaaart pro-celebrity pairing!"

          "headline": "What’s causing China’s economic downturn and what does it mean for Australia?",
          "bodyText": "“Because most Chinese are satisfied with the economy’s performance, Beijing would probably resist major adjustments in savings, consumption and investment incentives that did not serve its industrial policy goals. “Only the prospect of closed foreign markets or deep recession at home, neither of which Beijing believes is likely in the near term, would change this view.” The assessment by the US’s Central Intelligence Agency rings true – except it is dated 1986 and was about Japan, then a rising Asian power. Rather than rocketing to “Japan as number one”, as one book at the time warned, its economy would soon suffer property and stock market implosions from which it has never fully recovered. As with most analogues, Chinese and Japanese parallels only go so far. China, of course, is increasingly America’s paramount strategic rival. Japan still hosts 85 US military bases – many of them aimed at countering any Chinese threat. China already produces close to a third of the world’s manufacturing, or double the US’s share and nearly five times Japan’s. Every second tonne of steel has been made in China for a decade, while Japan’s share peaked at just over a third in the early 1970s. Still, as analysts such as Michael Pettis, a professor at Peking University, have long pointed out, China’s economy shares many similarities with Japan’s. These include an overreliance on construction and a dependence on export markets to absorb excess supply, a rapidly ageing and shrinking population and a curious resistance to spurring domestic consumer demand. All nations have a stake in how China’s economy fares in coming years, whether as a source of demand for commodities from exporters such as Australia, or a competitor for virtually any manufactured product. Global efforts to slow and even halt climate change hinge to a large degree on whether China can keep driving down the cost of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries that store renewable electricity and power cars. Renewed signs of deflation In an economy where transactions are almost entirely digitalised, companies – and presumably the Chinese government – have an ability to track activity more precisely and in real time probably unmatched in history. Foreign firms have invested in many Chinese operations – even if those investments are now reversing at a record clip – providing outsiders a line of sight on trends they never had with the Soviet Union. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email China, though, isn’t always keen to clarify the health of its economy. Authorities stopped providing youth unemployment figures when the jobless rate exceeded 20% in June 2023, only to release a revised dataset, the Economist noted this month. US treasury officials, too, have been puzzled by a discrepancy between customs and foreign exchange data of the size of China’s surplus that has ballooned to $US230bn ($A342bn) from an average gap of $US7bn since 2000. Numbers that have lately most alarmed financial markets include renewed signs of deflation, including the longest stretch of falling prices since 1999, Bloomberg reported this week. Cheaper Chinese products may help western nations – including Australia – rein in inflation, but they won’t be so welcomed by trade-exposed factories in those nations. Visitors to China leave with impressions that – confusingly – point to an economy boosting awesome technological advances but which also seems to be in a funk. Cities even in remote regions are filled with new cars, the vast majority of them built in China. More than one in two car sales are now electric vehicles, with China accounting for 60% of global EV sales in 2023. (EV exports will probably accelerate rapidly unless trade barriers in the US and Europe stall them.) To get to those distant areas, travellers may ride on the 40,000-plus km high-speed railway that likely exceeds the rest of the world’s combined, or by car on the similarly vast network of highways. Shanghai’s metro, meanwhile, boasts 20 lines and 508 stations – versus a mere nine lines and 142 stations in Tokyo. Along the way, though, discordant signals abound. Few cities lack rapid rail or road connections – let alone more airports – that appear to justify construction on the gargantuan scale of past decades. Each city, too, has a varying number of so-called lanwei (“festering tail”) buildings where work appears to have halted midway. Property prices, which have dropped as much as 40% in some cities since 2021, can hardly be revived when clusters of unfinished apartments dot the horizon. ‘The biggest concern now is mortgage prepayment’ The business model local governments have relied on – namely selling land to developers – will be costly to replace. One temple complex near Taiyuan – a central city of about five million people – offers one modest vignette. It has built a stunning hall to showcase exquisite woodcarvings, but can’t open to the public; a nearby road has collapsed because of past mining and local authorities can’t find the funds to repair or re-route it. Chinese people clearly have the means to spend big, as LVMH – owners of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Tiffany &amp; Co – can attest, even if sales are lately on the skids. Economists such ANZ’s Xing Zhaopeng say consumers have been opting to repay debt early even though China’s central bank has been steadily cutting interest rates. “For consumption, the biggest concern now is mortgage prepayment,” Xing said. “We estimate 600bn yuan ($A125bn) of early prepayments per month, which is equivalent to 12% of retail sales and 15% of disposable income.” Those sums are in addition to normal repayments levels of about 200bn yuan. One prompt is the lack of alternative places to park the money. While Chinese stocks are yet to match Japan’s post-bubble crash – with the Nikkei 225 share index taking 35 years to its 1989 peak – they are at their lowest since January 2019, Bloomberg says. Australian firms hopeful of a rebound in demand as China progressively removes punitive tariffs imposed in 2020 on about $A20bn/year of exports may be disappointed unless consumption picks up. Exporters may face much bigger woes. Chinese factories have been stockpiling commodities that they are beginning to resell “at very low prices”, Xing says. “Our China commodity price index is now 5% lower than a year ago and 35% lower than two years ago.” Iron ore and oil make up more than half of that index, and both have been on the slide as economists pare back hopes China can achieve its 2024 GDP growth target of “around 5%”. Iron ore – Australia’s biggest export – dropped below $US90/t this month to its lowest level in almost two years while oil prices have been hovering near three-year lows. Cheaper fuel may be good news for non-EV motorists, but falling commodity demand is a headache for governments such Australia’s. Bumper prices played a big role in helping deliver Australia’s first back-to-back budget surpluses since 2007-08. But, each $US10/t decrease in the iron ore price alone lops about $500m from the budget and $5.3bn from Australia’s already anaemic GDP growth. The Reserve Bank has said Australia’s economy “is running a little bit hotter than we thought previously”. It has also warned that “the risks to Chinese growth remain tilted to the downside”. If those risks are realised, RBA interest rate cuts will happen sooner. The result may not be something to celebrate if it’s because China’s slowdown has gone global."

          "bodyText": "There is a saying that goes: you can judge a man by his shoes. Actually, that’s not true, there isn’t. The original proverb actually advises that you shouldn’t judge a man before you have walked a mile in his shoes. Which is almost the opposite, when you think about it, since it is counselling against snap judgments rather than in favour of them. Also, not really about shoes. Both sayings – the real one and my version – are wise in their own way. Not passing judgment on a person until you have walked in his shoes – climbed into his skin and walked around in it, as Atticus puts it to Scout – is kind of entry-level humanity, really. But the idea that you can judge a man by his shoes also has a nugget of truth in it, if you swap the word judge (bit judgy) for the word read. You can read a person by their shoes, because shoes are where we give ourselves away. Not because shoes are deep and meaningful, but because shoes are practical. Shoes are where your outfit gets real. They have to work. They are quite literally down to earth. Your shoes reveal your intentions and communicate them to the world. Sometimes in obvious ways (if you see someone putting wellies on, you can pretty much assume they are heading outdoors) and sometimes in more subtle ways. When you put on your highest, most teetering heels, you send a signal to the world that this is a day or evening you are prepared to put some effort into, and that you might not be up for a long walk home or getting the night bus. Right now, grownup shoes are the key to nailing fashion’s vibe. Loafers, court shoes and slingbacks have taken over from trainers, Crocs and jellies. This is an attitude, as much as an aesthetic. Fashion is getting a little more sophisticated, a little less silly. And that starts with shoes. These days, if I look in the mirror and feel like I can see a shadow of Cary Grant or Diane Keaton – the soft billow of a proper pair of trousers, a good shirt, possibly a waistcoat – that makes me happy. I don’t know quite how or when or why Grant and Keaton affixed themselves to my internal mood board, but I am pleased they have, because they bring a mood of low-key confidence – not so much swagger as unflappability – that feels good. Loafers are the perfect partner for proper trousers. You need something solid to ground the silhouette, but trainers feel too glaringly modern and make the silhouette feel too rounded, as if you’ve got dressed in bubble writing. Gucci are the OG here, of course, but I’m almost as fond of my trusty Russell &amp; Bromley pair, which have lasted four years and counting. Boden are also excellent for an affordable loafer. A midi skirt with flat white trainers remains a classic working-wardrobe formula, with one such woman on every rush-hour train carriage. If this is you and you are in the market for an update, can I suggest a low-heeled pump with an almond-shaped toe? You only need a teeny-tiny heel, so you can still do the school run, but now you can pretend you are wearing The Row. It will make your life much better – trust me, I do it all the time. The best part about the new grownup shoe is that this isn’t about balancing on a stiletto. We’re talking 5cm, max. A low-heeled slingback is a genius choice for comfort – you’ve got a stretchy strap, which gives a tiny but crucial flex in sizing so you don’t get any heel rubbing. Perfect – and very grownup – with the elegantly simple Jean Shrimpton meets Jackie O dresses that are around this season. Cool French-girl brand Sézane is brilliant at low-heeled shoes, which it calls “Babies”, as in baby heels. I can vouch for the slingback, low-heeled Paula Babies (£160), which I have in a shiny caramel colour. They are grownup without being boring – and divinely comfortable. Because the shoes you really need to be able to walk in are your own. Is there a proverb for that? Stylist’s assistant: Sam Deaman. Model: Maria Diniz at Milk. Jeans, £27.99, Zara.

          "headline": "Why Am I So Single? review – dating debacles from the duo behind Six",
          "bodyText": "Two writers of musical theatre are trying to pen a new show in this musical. To add to the meta mind scramble, they seem to be loosely based on Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, the creators of Why Am I So Single? “Write what you know,” suggests their agent. That truism did not hold for Marlow and Moss’s stratospherically successful first collaboration when they were still at university. Their fantastically subversive and uplifting Tudor musical Six, featuring Henry VIII’s wives as rock stars reincarnate, remains a West End sensation. These characters, 20-something best friends entirely of our time, follow their agent’s advice and convene on a sofa to figure out why they are forever single. The concept brings so much knowingness that the drama does not quite enter into any real storytelling territory for some time, stalled by the construction of itself: characters name – or rather disguise – themselves as Oliver (Jo Foster) and Nancy (Leesa Tulley) after their favourite musical. The playful theatricality and cute visual punning are reminiscent of Emma Rice: the furniture on Moi Tran’s set design is animated, so an actor in fancy dress is a lamp while another, in green, stands in for a plant. Co-directed by Moss and Ellen Kane, there are skits on unreliable men who cancel dates, and those who play power games on texts or lie about their height online. The barrage of “trashy men” these two encounter is embodied by an actor dressed as a dustbin. It is all amusing though rather familiar and fleeting, the scenes not quite joining up with each other. Beneath the japes, potent issues bubble, from Nancy’s break-up with her ex to Oliver’s trauma around identity – his/their pronouns shift, and there is an undertold backstory of hostility and surreptitiousness around sexuality, with a momentarily searing song in Shhh!!!!. It is performed with smiling anguish as a Marilyn Monroe-style number but the inner drama of both characters is too quickly submerged. What elevates the production is the score: every song is a powerhouse, even a preposterous one about a bee in the flat (Interlude in B Minor). The music ranges across genres, from rap to disco and a fabulous tap number in C U Never, to rock and musical ballad. It is possibly not as infectious as Six but the songs are better crafted, more heartfelt, the lyrics gleaming with wit, intelligence, bravura and, in the second half, emotional heft. The central performances are strong, too: Tulley fills her voice with feeling though Foster has more depth to their character. For tone and story, you wish for a trajectory with less archness and greater momentum. Or for a more cohesively arch play that leads to something beyond routine summaries of the dating game. The show resembles Michael R Jackson’s searing A Strange Loop, in its self-referential central premise but it worked to bigger and deeper effect in that musical. This really does feel like two people on a stage with only one other recurring character, Artie (Noah Thomas), and an ensemble that never really comes to life outside Kane’s fun, pop video choreography. The power of the drama hits in the second half as the characters become more vulnerable and intimate, with immensely moving numbers in Lost and Better Off Love Story. You see what the musical could have been, if these issues had been better integrated and extended. With material this alive – about friendship, family and heartache, all unrelated to the search for men – the first half about dating woes feels old hat as Bridget Jones, in spirit. The songs remain brilliant though, and in some senses the story seems secondary. Moss and Marlow are without doubt the most talented musical songwriters out there. I look forward to a long and illustrious partnership now that this difficult second album is out of the way and they are released from the burden of having to write what they know. Long live their friendship. • At the Garrick theatre, London, until 13 February"

Wes Streeting, the health secetary, has urged doctors’ union leaders to work with the government on its plans to change the NHS and to “stop sabre-rattling” on industrial action over pay. Junk food TV advertisements are to be banned from airing before the 9pm watershed as part of the government’s drive to improve public health. As Denis Campbell reports, in addition, online ads for products that are high in fat, salt and sugar will be banned altogether, Andrew Gwynne, the public health minister, told the Commons on Thursday. Both measures will come into force on 1 October 2025. The UK’s debt mountain will almost triple to more than 270% of national income over the next 50 years because of pressures from an ageing population, the climate crisis and security risks, the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned. Nigel Farage’s Reform party has attracted a new cadre of big donors including £500,000 from Fiona Cottrell, the mother of his high-profile, unpaid aide George Cottrell. Diana Johnson, the minister for policing and crime prevention, has had her purse stolen at a conference for senior police officers. Vulnerable prisoners are being forced to inherit the debt of the previous occupant of their cells leading to violence and extortion, the minister Lord Timpson told peers. As Rajeev Syal reports, the prisons minister also said new inmates are being forced to pay twice as much back - which he called ‘double bubble’ - after borrowing cash to buy everyday items such as shampoo and biscuits. Timpson, a former businessman who has been brought into government because of his long running interest in prison reform. Answering a question in the Lords, he said that gangs are forcing vulnerable prisoners into debt, sometimes demanding that they repay cash owed by former prisoners who have since moved out of a cell. Timpson said: We know that debt drives poor safety and outcomes, and the drug trade really fuels it, so we need to make sure our vulnerable prisoners are not extorted, assaulted, and not forced to do things they don’t want to do. There have been many instances of prisoners inheriting the debt on the former resident of that cell. We are now closing this blog but you can read all our UK politics coverage here. Here is John Crace’s sketch of Keir Starmer’s NHS speech this morning. George Osborne will be approve. (See 4.49pm.) In another sign that Keir Starmer has discovered his “inner Tony Blair”, the PM has appointed Sir Michael Barber as his “adviser on effective delivery”. In a news release the Cabinet Office said: Sir Michael will support the prime minister in driving forward the delivery of the five national missions. This will include coordinating ambitious, measurable, long-term objectives that deliver change across the UK. The part-time role is a direct ministerial appointment and will be unpaid. Sir Michael will take up the role for an initial 12-month period, starting in September 2024. Sir Michael has extensive experience in implementing large-scale system change, working with many governments internationally to drive delivery. Barber worked for the Blair government, first as chief adviser in the education department and then as head of Tony Blair’s delivery unit. In that role he was seen as a successful innovator capable of getting the civil service machine to deliver tangible improvements in public services. Since then other UK prime ministers have asked him to take on advisory roles, and he has worked as a governance consultant around the world. Jeremy Hunt has hit back against the cabinet secretary Simon Case after Case accused him of contributing to financial uncertainty when he was chancellor. Speaking at the Policy Live conference in central London this afternoon, Hunt defended himself for the first time against Case’s accusation that he should have held a spending review while in office to clarify the state of the public finances. Case made the accusation in a letter defending Labour’s claims that the previous government left behind a £22bn fiscal black hole. Hunt said: The right time to do a spending review is at the start of a parliament. It needs to be three, or if I could have my way, four years long so that departments have the stability to do long term planning. And in a barb directly aimed at Case he added: I don’t remember ever being advised by the Treasury, or indeed the cabinet secretary, to have another spending review a year before an election, because that would have created enormous upheaval. Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor, has said that Keir Starmer needs to put a lot of money into the NHS now if he wants people to see a “marked improvement” by the election. Speaking on on his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, he said that reform on its own would not be enough. Balls said: The reforms are important, but the thing which will make the biggest difference is a big injection of resources. If Labour wants to have delivered change by the next election, that injection of resources has to happen now. When we [the Blair/Brown government in 1997 – Balls was Brown’s chief adviser] came into power we actually waited, we built up investment in the NHS through the first term, then made a big push in the second term. Keir Starmer can’t afford to take that long … There is no way on earth there will be a marked improvement in health outcomes or perception of the health service without a substantially bigger increase in health resources over this parliament than what we’ve seen on average in the last 15 years. And if you say he’s not going to do that, then it’s not going to work. Balls’ argument echoes the SNP’s criticism of Starmer’s health speech this morning. (See 1.43pm.) Ironically Osborne, his co-host, seemed more supportive of Starmer when they discussed the speech in their podcast. Osborne said: What Keir Starmer is saying is his solution is not more money. That is quite a thing for a new Labour prime minister to say. He says the NHS has reached a fork in the road, and we can either increase taxes on working people to pay for more of the healthcare required by an ageing society, or we can reform – and then he says it’s a case of ‘we can reform or die.’ [See 2.05pm.] It felt to me that that’s the first time I’ve heard Starmer summon up his inner Tony Blair … That’s quite a different message than you had from the Labour Party in recent years, which is ‘There’s not enough money going into the NHS.’ In Osborne’s mind, “inner Tony Blair” is a high compliment. He and David Cameron used to refer to Blair as “the master” as they plotted how the Tories could return to power by copying him. Balls played a major role in Labour politics for 20 years, culminating in a stint as shadow chancellor under Ed Miliband. But now he is a TV presenter and podcaster. He is married to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. And, talking of GB News, Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, has today floated a proposal that could lead to one of its most high-profile presenters being taken off air. As leader of the Commons, Powell is chair of the Commons modernisation committeee, a new committee set up to modernise some Commons procedures. Most select committees are there to scrutinise the work of government departments, and are chaired by backbenchers. But this one is there to push through Commons modernisation, a government ambition, and that is why it is chaired by a minister. The last Labour government also set up a Commons modernisation committee, but the coalition and Tory governments after 2010 did not see the need for one. Today Powell has published a six-page memo setting out the committee’s main aims. And it suggests she wants to change Commons rules to stop, or limit, the amount of paid media work that MPs can do. It says: [The committee] should consider what advantages, if any, outside paid engagements such as media appearances, journalism and speeches furnish to the public, versus the potential conflicts of interest and attention that arise from such paid endeavours. The modernisation committee will wish to consult closely with the parliamentary commissioner for standards, who is best placed to advise on the practicability of any further changes to the rules governing members’ outside interests. Potentially this could affect many MPs, but one of the biggest losers might be Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader. Recently figures in the Commons register of members’ interest showed him earning almost £1.2m from GB News. Since Labour took office rules on outside earnings by MPs have already been tightened. MPs used to be banned from taking a paid job offering parliamentary advice (which can be similar to lobbying – also already banned), but they were allowed to take money for providing general political advice. That is now also banned. In her memo, Powell also says she wants the committee to consider allocating more time in the chamber for government business and less time for backbench business. She says backbench debates are not well attended, and that they sometimes result in the Commons having to adjourn early because there is no one left wanting to speak. She says: Given the government’s extensive legislative programme, as set out in the king’s speech, I am committed to treating parliamentary time as the precious resource that it is. This means placing a greater emphasis on members scrutinising government legislation going forwards. In a post on social media, Darren Grimes, another GB News presenter, said Powell’s plan was unfair. David Lammy hosted a show on LBC and Labour never saw an issue. When right-leaning MPs get shows though, with big audiences, well, they must be stopped. I see no issue with an MP having a second job, it ought to be up to their constituents, not Labour, to decide if that’s right. Earlier this year it was often said that the Conservative leadership contest would be largely fought out on, and perhaps even decided by, GB News, the rightwing, pro-Brexit news channel. If Harry Cole from the Sun is correct, that prophecy may turn out to be more accurate than people thought. Cole says the Tories are asking Camilla Tominey, a GB News presenter, and Christopher Hope, GB News’ political editor, to hold Q&amp;A sessions with all the Tory candidates at conference. NEW: Understand Conservative Party Board met on Tuesday and agreed that the candidates will do Q&amp;A sessions with Camilla Tominey and Chris Hope on the Monday and Tuesday of conference. Then all will get back to back 20 min speeches on the Wednesday plus a two minute video. It is looking as if the Tory conference will end up as little more than a four-day leadership hustings, and these Q&amp;A sessions may end up as the main events. Starmer Chris Stark, the official at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero in charge of decarbonising the electricity grid, has said that he wants to follow the vaccine taskforce model to help him meet his goal. Speaking at a Green Alliance event this morning, Stark said that he had been looking at how the taskforce set up by Boris Johnson was able to rapidly implement a Covid vaccine programme that in normal circumstances would have taken many years. He has also hired some of the people who worked on the vaccine taskforce to join his green energy programme. As head of “mission control” at the energy department, which is led by Ed Miliband, Stark is meant to ensure the government hits its target of delivering green energy by 2030. Stark was previously chief executive at the Climate Change Committee, and when he was there it recommended setting 2035 for the decarbonisation of the electricty grid. At the conference this morning he recalled being asked by Keir Starmer if 2030 would be a realistic target instead. He said: The more observant among you will have noticed that my recommended target when I was at the CCC was not 2030, it was 2035, which we felt to be a very ambitious target at the time. And Keir Starmer asked, I think, quite an interesting question, which is, why can’t we do it earlier. And I and a few others sucked through the teeth and told them, well, it might be possible to do it sooner, but only if you pull all the right levers in the right order. And they didn’t blink at that. So we are going into this mission for an earlier deadline. Eyes open on the scale of the challenge, but clear I think that it can be done. And that’s the kind of bold mission that I think, I feel we can get behind. And it’s so exciting to have that support right from the top of the government, right the way to the prime minister. Stark said that in order to meet the goal he is “not pissing about” in making the steps needed to reach the goal, including boosting heat pumps, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Downing Street has now published the full text of Keir Starmer’s speech on the Darzi report and NHS reform on its website. And here is the passage where Starmer talked about the need for NHS reform, saying “it’s reform or die”. Look, the NHS is at a fork in the road. And we have a choice about how it should meet these rising demands. Don’t act and leave it to die. Raise taxes on working people or reform to secure its future. Working people can’t afford to pay more. So it’s reform or die. So let me be clear from the outset, what reform does not mean. First, it does not mean abandoning those founding ideals. Of a public service, publicly funded, free at the point of use … The problem isn’t that the NHS is the wrong model, it’s the right model, it’s just not taking advantage of the opportunities in front of it. And that’s what needs to change. Second, reform does not mean just putting more money in. Of course, even in difficult financial circumstances, a Labour government will always make the investments in our NHS that are needed. Always. But we have to fix the plumbing before turning on the taps. So, hear me when I say this, no more money without reform. I am not prepared to see even more of your money spent on agency staff who cost £5,000 a shift, on appointment letters, which arrive after the appointment or on paying for people to be stuck in hospital just because they can’t get the care they need in the community … That isn’t just solved by more money - it’s solved by reform. And third, reform does not mean trying to fix everything from Whitehall. It really doesn’t. When Lord Darzi says the vital signs of the NHS are strong. He’s talking about the talents and passion of our NHS workforce. That’s what he’s talking about. The breadth and depth of clinical talent. The extraordinary compassion and care of our NHS staff. If we are going to build an NHS that is fit for the future, then I tell you, we are going to do it with our NHS staff and, with our patients too. This is the passage explaining the ‘why’ part of Starmer’s reform argument. See 11.39am for the ‘how’ part. And the Green party is also calling for more investment in the NHS. In his response to the Darzi report, Adrian Ramsay, the Green party’s co-leader, said it was wrong for Keir Starmer to appear to be more interested in reform than investment. (See 10.25am.) He said: The Darzi review pulls no punches: the NHS has been harmed by austerity, capital starvation, the disastrous 2012 Health and Social Care Act and the dire state of social care. It is therefore hugely disappointing to see Labour, like a string of previous Conservative and Labour governments, hooked on reform rather than investment. Starmer says there can be no money without reform. We say there can be no improvement to waiting times, cancer death rates, treatment for mental health – and many other struggling areas – without more money. The SNP says the Darzi report vindicates its call for higher health spending. Stephen Flynn, its leader at Wesminster, said: Lord Darzi’s report exposes the catastrophic damage that fourteen years of Westminster austerity cuts, chronic underfunding and Brexit have done to the NHS. For more than a decade, the SNP has repeatedly warned about the damage UK government cuts and underfunding were causing our NHS. There is no escaping the fact that alongside constant modernisation, the NHS needs more money - and it needs it now, if it is to deliver the best possible healthcare. Diana Johnson, a Home Office minister, “had her purse stolen at an annual conference for senior police officers”, Ramsay Hodgson reports for the Financial Times. Officially Johnson is minister for policing, fire and crime prevention. This is from my colleague Kiran Stacey. I think Labour might be taking their “public services are all broken” strategy a bit *too* far. Here is a video extract from Keir Starmer’s speech this morning. Organisations in the health care sector have largely welcomed the Darzi report, and the government’s proposal to respond with more emphasis on technology, on primary care and on prevention. Here are some of the extracts from statements they have put out. Prof Philip Banfield, council chair at the BMA, which represents doctors, said in a statement the BMA was glad the problems with the NHS had been properly recognised. The previous government gaslit doctors and refused to acknowledge the damage caused by years of underinvestment. The BMA has tirelessly spoken out about the challenges our health service faces, particularly regarding staff shortages, so one might expect that Lord Darzi’s review, which echoes many of the association’s concerns, would be met with a sense of relief – finally, someone understands. While the findings are unsurprising, seeing this report so clearly call attention to just how broken our beloved NHS has become, with the devastating impact on our patients, is deeply sobering. Prof Nicola Ranger, general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said Darzi’s conclusions were right. Nursing staff will recognise many of Lord Darzi’s conclusions, not least how sustained austerity, cuts to public health and failure to invest in community services have impacted NHS performance and patient care. The modest increases in the size of the nursing workforce have been significantly outstripped by the demand piled on the NHS in recent years. Nursing staff are now too commonly caring for patients in corridors or left in armchairs, the ‘congestion’ mentioned in the report, which leaves them feeling short-staffed and unable to give the quality of care they would want. Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, said the proposals were “a big step in the the right direction”. The NHS is down but not out. The sheer scale of the challenge facing trust leaders and their teams as they strive to get the health service back on track is plain for all to see … Lord Darzi’s prescription for reforming the health service – by creating a digital NHS, focusing on prevention and public health, and ensuring patients are cared for closer to home- is a big step in the right direction. This must go hand in hand with sustainable funding and investment, an end to chronic workforce shortages and more capital investment to boost productivity and meet growing demand. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which also represents trusts, said Darzi’s analysis was sound. In a statement he said: This report paints a bleak picture of the state of an NHS which, despite working harder than ever before, has been struggling in the face of rising demand, a decade of underinvestment and the impact of the pandemic. NHS leaders will recognise Lord Darzi’s diagnosis of the NHS’ problems and will work with the government to help address them. The review has rightly identified many of the root causes, not least how we invest much less in our buildings, technology and equipment than many comparable countries. William Pett, head of policy at Healthwatch England, which represents patients, said patients would welcome the report. In a statement he said: People will welcome Lord Darzi’s prognosis on the NHS. Although the NHS does much good, patients repeatedly share their frustrations and confusion about accessing care. Gill Walton, chief executive at the Royal College of Midwives, said maternity care should have featured more prominently. The new health secretary, Wes Streeting MP, said that of all of the issues that keep him awake at night, maternity safety is top of the list, so we remain optimistic and hopeful that our new government understand these pressing issues and will put the safety of mothers and babies, and of midwifery staff at the top of his list. All we’re asking is that every maternity service has the right staff in the right place at the right time. Rob Yeldham, director of strategy at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, welcomed the focus on community care. We strongly endorse the calls to expand healthcare in the community and to build care around the needs of the individual. Community rehab keeps people out of hospital and is essential in a time when, more are living with multiple long-term conditions. The recognition of the growing challenge is very welcome. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive of Mind, the mental health charity, said some of the revelations were shocking. This is a dark day for mental health. Lord Darzi’s findings showing many people in mental health crisis are being held in rooms constructed for a Victorian asylum are disturbing, shameful, but ultimately unsurprising. The UK’s debt mountain will almost triple to more than 270% of national income over the next 50 years because of pressures from an ageing population, the climate crisis and security risks, the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned. Phillip Inman has the story here. Streeting adopted a very different tone when responding to Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat’s health spokesperson. In her contribution she said the Lib Dems had long called for more focus on primary care, and more focus on prevention. She also said that Labour’s failure to have a plan for social care was “the elephant in the room”. In response, Streeting said it was “refreshing to have constructive opposition in the chamber”. He went on: Let me say, and it was clear throughout the election campaign actually, that my party and Liberal Democrats have much in common, both in terms of the commitments we made, which were in some cases identical, and also the shared areas of emphasis, the link between health and wealth, the importance on prevention and the importance of social care. He said the government was determined to reform social care, working where possible on a cross-party basis. In her response to Streeting, Victoria Atkins, the shadow health secretary, accuses him of “political posturing” and urged him instead to talk constructively about the future. She said there was '“much to be proud of” in the NHS. It is looking after 1.6 million people a day, 25% more people than in 2010. While she quoted figures for how much the Tories had invested in the NHS, she said they had “never pretended that everything was fixed”, that there were easy answers or that as a party they had “a monopoly of wisdom”. But the last government did announce an NHS productivity plan at the time of the budget, she said. She claimed the proposals in it would lead to a 2% increase in productivity by the end of the decade, unlocking £35bn’s worth of savings. But Darzi had not even mentioned it, he said. She asked if it was being cancelled. Responding to Atkins, Streeting said: The first word the shadow secretary of state for health and social care should have said was sorry. She says she never pretended everything was fixed, and that’s true, but it’s about time that she admits that it was their party that broke the NHS in the first place. He said Atkins, health secretary before the election, was not to blame for everything in the Darzi report. But he said she should “show some humility on behalf of her party” and apologise. Streeting did not say what was happening to Atkins’ productivity plan. Wes Streeting’s opening statement to MPs about the Darzi report echoed much of what Keir Starmer said this morning. But he was notably more partisan, and more damning about the opposition. Referring to the effects of austerity, and the impact of the Andrew Lansley health reforms, which are strongly criticised in the Darzi report (see 9.49am), he said: It is not just that the Conseratives didn’t fix the roof while the sun was shining. They doused the house with petrol, left the gas on and Covid just lit the match. That’s why waiting lists are stuck on 7.6m long today. And he was particularly critical of the Tories’s failure to reform the NHS. Since 2019 the previous government oversaw a 17% increase in the number of staff working in hospitals. Did it lead to better outcomes for patients? No. At great expense to the taxpayer, the NHS has instead seen a huge fall in productivity. We paid more but got less, a deplorable waste of resources when so many parts of our health and care services were crying out for investment. As Lord Darzi puts it, British Airways wouldn’t hire more pilots without buying more planes. Doctors and nurses are wasting their time trying to find beds for their patients, dealing with outdated IT, when they ought to be treating patients. Theresa May, the former prime minister, has taken her seat in the House of Lords. At the introduction ceremony in the the Lords this moring, she was supported by Lord True, shadow leader in the Lords, and Lady Evans of Bowes Park, his predecessor and leader of the Lords when May was PM. The dramatic decline in international student numbers coming to UK universities this autumn has been confirmed by the latest Home Office figures for sponsored study visas. The figures for August, traditionally the peak month for applications by international students, suggest around 20,000 fewer study visas were issued during the month compared with the last two years. The Home Office said student applications between January to August this year were 278,700, 17% lower than the same period in 2023, which would mean 56,000 fewer than the first eight months of last year. Much of the fall follows the Conservative government’s decision to restrict family dependents accompanying international students to the UK. Although vice-chancellors say they have recently detected a revival in applications and enquiries since the change of government in July, it may have come too late to repair the damage for courses starting in autumn. Frank Hester gave the Conservatives a further £5m just before the election, according to data from the Electoral Commission, despite the party coming under pressure over his remarks about Diane Abbott that were widely condemned as racist. Rowena Mason has the story here. Victoria Atkins, the shadow health secretary, was doing a media round this morning, but when she was asked on LBC if she approved of the party taking money from Hester just before the election, when his comments about Abbott were public, she ducked the question, telling the presenter, Nick Ferrari: I completely reject any of the comments that that individual is alleged to have made. I had nothing to do with fundraising in central office. What I do know is that we’re in the middle of a leadership election, and the future of the Conservative Party is being debated now. I am sure that the candidates involved will have answers to this. Asked repeatedly if the party should return the money donated by Hester, Atkins refused three times to say, insisting “it’s not for me to get involved in party finances”. In the Commons Wes Streeting is making a statement about the Darzi report. Much of what he says is likely to repeat what he and Keir Starmer have said already today, and what has been reported here, and so I will just be covering it selectively, focusing on what’s new. In his speech Keir Starmer talked in some detail about the the government’s three priorities for reform – more focus on digital and technology, more focus on primary care, and more focus on prevention. Here are the key extracts. On the need for more digitalisation, and better use of technology First moving from an analogue to a digital NHS. We can already see glimpses of the extraordinary potential of technology, like the world’s first ever non-invasive, knifeless surgery for kidney cancer – just imagine that, pioneered by Leeds teaching hospitals. Or the precision cancer scanners – I saw some of them yesterday … Take an innovation like the NHS app. This could be a whole digital front door to the NHS – appointments, self referral reminders for check-ups and screenings, patients in control of their own data. healthcare so much more transparent … We’ve got to have fully digital patient record, so that crucial information is there for you whenever you go to the NHS. (When Starmer is asked about his record as director of public prosecutions, one of the things he talks about with most pride is digitalising CPS records, which he says made a big difference in terms of court efficiency.) On the need to focus more on primary care Second, we’ve got to shift more care from hospitals to communities. Now, the King’s Fund has long called for this. Successive governments have repeatedly promised it. But what’s happened? The opposite. The share of the NHS budget spent on hospitals has actually increased. This 10-year plan has to be the moment that we change that, the moment we begin to turn our national health service into a neighborhood health service. That means more tests, scans, healthcare offered on high streets and town centers, improved GP access, bringing back the family doctor, offering digital consultations for those that want them, virtual wards and more patients safely looked after in their own homes, where we can deal with problems early, before people are off work sick, and before they need to go to hospital. On the need to focus more on prevention And, third, we have got to be much bolder in moving from sickness to prevention. We’ve already announced NHS health checks in workplaces, blood pressure checks at dentists and opticians. But that’s just the beginning. Planning for 10 years means we can make long term investments in new technologies that will help catch and prevent problems earlier. And there are some areas in particular where we’ve just got to be more ambitious, like children’s mental health or children’s dentistry. According to polling by YouGov, people are more likely to think the NHS will get worse than that it will get better – although optimism has risen considerably since Labour won the election. Wes Streeting will be making a statement to MPs about the Darzi report at about 11.30am. He is unlikely to say anything much beyond what Starmer said in his speech, but I will be monitoring it anyway. Q: Are you going to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets in Russia? Starmer says he is off to Washington later for strategic discussions with President Biden about Urkaine and the Middle East. He does not answer the question. And that is the end of the Q&amp;A. I will post more analysis and reaction soon. Q: When will you introduce the cap on adult social care costs (shelved by Rachel Reeves in her statement in July)? Starmer says the last government promised this, but Labour had to delay the plans because they were “undeliverable” within the time frame proposed by the Tories. The government is reviewing it. But he says this will be included in the 10-year plan. “But it’s got to be done properly,” he says. UPDATE: Starmer said: On the capping of the [social care costs], promises were again made by the last government. They were delayed because they were undeliverable. We’ve looked at them. We don’t think they’re deliverable in the timeframe the last government said, and that’s why we’ve taken them down and we’ll review it. Now, it is an issue we’re going to have to look at, I readily accept that. We will have it within the 10 year plan. But again, it’s got to be done properly. It’s got to be deliverable. Q: [From the Sun] Given you caved in to train drivers, how can Sun readers trust you to overcome resistance from the medical profession? Starmer replies: Because I’ve reformed before. I reformed when I was heading up the Crown Prosecution Service. I wanted to change it, to make it much more victim oriented, and we faced a huge challenge. We took it on. We changed it. I wanted to drive up conviction rates for violence against women and girls. We faced resistance about how we were doing it. We burst through that and made the change. So I could give any number of examples. I’ve worked in Northern Ireland where we had to create a new police service. In Northern Ireland there was resistance, but we pressed on and did it. When I arrived as leader of Labour party, I knew we had to change it. There was a lot of resistance, but we pressed on and did it. Starmer said that, if there was one “common theme” to what he had been doing professionally “for some time”, it was imposing change. UPDATE: Starmer said: If there’s one sort of common theme of what I’ve done for a living for some time now, it’s coming in and bringing about the change, and I’m determined that we will bring about the change here. Q: When will people see a difference in A&amp;E waiting times? Starmer says the government is already working on this. It is a “classic example of where you need more technology”. Mainly people are waiting for the results of tests. So “much better use of technology” will make a diffierence. Q: What kind of preventative health measures are you looking at? Starmer says prevention will be a priority. He mentions smoking. And teeth – he was shocked by how many children have teeth decay. That is preventable, he says. Diet and lifestyle are important too, he says. Q: Prof John Bell said this morning the BMA has been a drag on reform. Do you expect them to help you? Starmer says he knows from his time as DPP that, whenever you try to reform something, some people are opposed. He says he wants to work with professionals. But if there is opposition, “we have to take that on, and we will take that on.” Q: When will you announce a plan for social care? Starmer says he wants to work with staff on this. He wants a fair pay system for care workers. Social care is obviously part of his 10-year plan for the NHS. Q: What would you say to a patient who is on a waiting list in pain about how you will make things better for them? Starmer says he is not offering a “quick fix”. It will take time and money. Starmer is now taking questions. Q: Why will you be able to do this, when other reform plans have not worked? Starmer says in the past governments have not applied his mission-driven approach. Starmer is now talking about the government’s three priorities for reform – more focus on digital, more focus on primary care, and more focus on prevention. (See 8.44am.) He ends by saying the NHS can be reformed, because that has happened before. He says: It won’t be easy. It won’t be quick. It will take a 10-year plan, not just the work of one parliament, but I know we can do it, because we’ve done reform before. The last Labour government reformed the NHS to deliver better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers. And he says this should be a moment of “hope”, because of what is possible. Starmer is still talking about NHS reform, and he says it “does not mean trying to fix everything from Whitehall”. He says the NHS is full of talent. He wants to work with staff on reform, he says. Starmer is now talking about how the government will reform the NHS. He starts by saying: Let me be clear from the outset what reform does not mean first - it does not mean abandoning those founding ideas of a public service, publicly funded, free at the point of use, the basic principle of dignity, inspired, of course, by Bevan that when you fall ill, you should never have to worry about the bill. Using comments he made a lot during the election campaign, he stresses how personal support for the NHS is for him. His mother and sister both worked in the NHS, his wife works in the NHS, and the NHS cared for his mother for many years when she was seriously ill, he says. Starmer says reform “does not mean just putting more money in now,”. A Labour government will always invest in the NHS, he says. But, he goes on: We have to fix the plumbing before turning on the taps. So hear me when I say this – no more money without reform. I’m not prepared to see even more of your money spent on agency staff who cost £5,000 a shift, on appointment letters which arrive after the appointment, or on paying for people to be stuck in hospital just because they can’t get the care they need in the community. Starmer says this cannot all be blamed on Covid. He goes on: Covid hit our NHS harder than healthcare systems in other countries. The NHS delayed, canceled or postponed,far more routine care during the pandemic than any comparable health system. And why? Because our NHS went into the pandemic in a much more fragile state, fewer doctors, fewer nurses, fewer beds than most other high income health systems. Starmer says that was a result of the “ideologically-driven, top down reorganization of 2012” championed by Andrew Lansley. That was “hopelessly misconceived”, he says. And he quotes what the report says about the Lansley reforms being “a calamity”. (See 9.49am.) Starmer sets out some of the most negative findings in the report. Take the waiting times in A&amp;A - more than 100,000 infants waited more than six hours last year. And nearly a tenth of all patients are now waiting for 12 hours or more. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety, it’s leading to thousands of avoidable deaths. And that phrase, avoidable deaths should always be chilling … [it means] people’s loved ones who could have been saved, doctors and nurses whose whole vocation is to save them hampered from doing so. It’s devastating, heartbreaking, infuriating and that’s just scratching the surface. High-risk heart attack patients waiting too long for urgent treatment, cancer diagnosis waiting too long, with cancer death rates higher than in other countries. And when it comes to getting help for mental health, 345,000 are waiting over a year. That’s roughly the entire population of Leicester. Starmer is speaking now. He starts by saying the Darzi report is “an incredibly comprehensive analysis”, and a “raw and honest assessment”. He says the King’s Fund is full of experts whose contribution will be vital as the government tries to get the NHS back on its feet. Public satisfaction with the NHS has fallen from an all-time high, under the last Labour government, to an all-time low, under the Tories. They “broke” the NHS, he says. Even Lord Darzi, with all his years of experience, is shocked by what he discovered. It is unforgivable, and people have every right to be angry. Starmer says the NHS failings are literally a matter of life and death. Sarah Woolnough, the King’s Fund chief executive, is introducing Starmer. This is what she has said about the Darzi report in a statement released overnight. The review is more than just a gloomy assessment of how long it will take to recover services, it is a mandate for government to take bold, decisive action. The biggest improvements to health and care in this country will come from prioritising services outside of hospital. That means greater investment in the primary and community services that support people before they end up needing hospital treatment. It means political focus on public health strategies that keep people healthy and prevent illness in the first place. And it means finally getting to grips with the much-needed reform of adult social care. Lord Darzi’s review also underscores the need to move beyond past lazy criticism regarding the value of NHS managers and instead recognise that implementing major improvement to the health service requires investment in high-quality leaders. Ministers now face tough trade-offs between tackling immediate NHS pressures or prioritising reform of the root causes of the crisis. Today’s review makes clear that incremental improvement will not do – radical change is needed. Keir Starmer is about to deliver his speech on the NHS. He is at the King’s Fund in London, a health thinktank. Wes Streeting says he wants to reduce the NHS waiting list by “millions” by the time of the next election. (See 9.21am.) Statistics out today show the figure for NHS England is 7.62m, PA Media reports. PA says: The size of the waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England was unchanged in July, following three consecutive monthly increases, figures show. An estimated 7.62 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of July, relating to 6.39 million patients, NHS England said. The list hit a record high in September 2023 with 7.77 million treatments and 6.50 million patients, after which the figures fell for several months before rising in April, May and June of this year. In an interview with LBC, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said that, although Labour wants more focus on preventative health measures, it would not be bringing in new salt or sugar taxes. He explained: That wasn’t in our manifesto and the reason why we are reluctant to go down that sort of route is because there is a cost-of-living crisis at the moment and I think we have got to get the balance right. Crucially, on public health and prevention measures we have got to take people with us … The priorities we have are the ones that are in our manifesto, which are particularly around children’s health and making sure we are stopping the marketing of junk food at them, stopping the scourge of vaping amongst teenagers, for example. Those are our priorities and we don’t have plans for sugar and salt taxes. The Conservatives have accused Labour of not having a “meaningful” plan for NHS reform. In a statement released overnight in response to the Darzi report, Victoria Akins, the shadow health secretary, said: We will review this report carefully but it appears that Labour have missed an opportunity to put together meaningful plans for reform. We Conservatives recognise that investment has to be married with reform. This is why we brought forward long-term plans for productivity, tech, Pharmacy First, virtual wards, attracting pharmaceutical research and training and retaining staff. We did this whilst boosting investment in the NHS in real terms every single year. The Labour government will be judged on its actions. It has stopped new hospitals from being built, scrapped our social care reforms and taken money from pensioners to fund unsustainable pay rises with no gains in productivity. They need to move from rhetoric to action. The Darzi report describes the Health and Social Care Act 2012, passed by the coalition government but championed by Andrew Lansley, the Tory health secretary, as a “calamity”. It says: The Health and Social Care Act of 2012 was a calamity without international precedent. It proved disastrous. By dissolving the NHS management line, it took a “scorched earth” approach to health reform, the effects of which are still felt to this day. It has taken more than 10 years to get back to a sensible structure. And management capability is still behind where it was in 2011. Some sanity has been restored by the 2022 Act which put integrated care systems on a statutory basis. This has the makings of a sensible management structure, consisting of a headquarters, seven regions and 42 integrated care boards (ICBs) whose strategy to tackle inequalities, and to improve population health, is set by an Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) that includes local government and the third sector alongside the NHS itself. In an interview with Sky News this morning Atkins said she was surprised by this because she thought Darzi had been in favour of the Lansley reforms at the time. She said: The puzzlement of that is that I’m told – I wasn’t in parliament at the time – but I’m told that Lord Darzi supported those reforms at the time. In interviews this morning Wes Streeting, the health secretary, also said that new money for the NHS would be focused on primary care (GP and community services), rather than on hospitals. He was speaking in an interview on BBC Breakfast, and here are the key points. Streeting said primary care and community services would be the “first port of call” for extra NHS spending. He explained: We’ll be setting out our plans in the budget and the spending review, but effectively it means that when it comes to more resources for the NHS, additional resources going in, the first port of call will be primary care and community services, and social care too, because we’ve got to deal with the systemic problems in our health and care services. Streeting said the government would deliver new hospitals promised by the last government, but more slowly than originally planned. He said: In terms of the schemes that were on what the last government called the New Hospitals Programme, I am determined to deliver those schemes. But I might have to do it over a longer period of time because I’ve got to make sure, firstly, the money is there, secondly that the timetables are realistic and we’ve got the supply chain, the labour and the resources that we will need, and thirdly I’ve got to balance the need for new bricks and mortar alongside the need for new technology. He said the NHS could go bust without reform. He said: If we don’t grasp both the immediate challenge in front of us and deal with the crisis today, but also prepare the NHS for the challenges of the future in terms of an ageing society and disease and rising costs, rather than a country with an NHS, we’re going to have an NHS with a country attached to it if we’re not careful, and more likely an NHS that goes bust. He said he wanted to cut NHS waiting lists by “millions” by the time of the next election. He said: I’m going hell for leather to get the NHS back to what’s known as the constitutional standards, the targets it sets for itself, over the five-year period that we committed to, and to make sure that by the end of this parliament we see waiting lists millions lower than they are today. In June the NHS waiting list figure was 7.62m, up from 7.6m in May. The figure for July is due out later this morning. The Darzi report says the NHS has a £37bn shortfall in capital investment. It says: On top of that, there is a shortfall of £37 billion of capital investment. These missing billions are what would have been invested if the NHS had matched peer countries’ levels of capital investment in the 2010s. That sum could have prevented the backlog maintenance, modernised technology and equipment, and paid for the 40 new hospitals that were promised but which have yet to materialise. It could have rebuilt or refurbished every GP practice in the country. Instead, we have crumbling buildings, mental health patients being accommodated in Victoria-era cells infested with vermin with 17 men sharing two showers, and parts of the NHS operating in decrepit portacabins. Twenty per cent of the primary care estate predates the founding of the health service in 1948. In interviews this morning, Wes Streeting, the health secretary stressed that the new government would not be able to make up for this shortfall quickly. In an interview on Times Radio, asked if the government would be finding an extra £37bn for the NHS, Streeting replied: No, not in a big bang, and it’s important I say that up front for two reasons. One is so the chancellor doesn’t have a heart attack over her breakfast this morning with me writing her spending review for her. But secondly, and very seriously, I think people know that it’s taken more than a decade to break the NHS and it’s going to take time to get the NHS back on its feet, and to make sure it’s fit for the future … Because we don’t invest in the capital and the tech, day-to-day spending balloons out of control, and then capital and tech budgets are raided to plug the gaps in day-to-day spending, and so the cycle repeats. In the spending review, the chancellor and I are determined to break that cycle by really focusing on the capital investment and the tech investment that will help us to bring down ballooning costs on the day-to-day spending and improve the productivity of the system. Good morning. Keir Starmer has been in office for just over two months, and for much of that time the government has focused on trying to explain to the public just how bad was the legacy the left by the Tories. There has been extensive focus on the economy, and on prisons. Today Starmer is focusing on the NHS. And, arguably, this is the most important issue at all. According to polling by More in Common, at the next election the single issue most likely to determine whether Labour has succeeded or not is whether NHS waiting lists have fallen. Today the government has published a 163-page report by Lord Darzi, a senior surgeon and member of the House of Lords who served as a health minister under Gordon Brown, about the state of the NHS. Summing up his findings in an article for the Daily Mirror, Darzi says: The state of the NHS isn’t an accident. The health service was hit by three big shocks. The 2010s saw the biggest slowdown in funding since it was founded in 1948. The next big shock was the top-down reorganisation of the NHS, which threw it into chaos for years. Then came the shock of the Covid pandemic, which hit the NHS harder than other similar countries – largely because of the other two shocks. Two of the three shocks identified by Darzi are Tory-linked and, in a speech later this morning, Starmer will describe the damage done to the NHS as “unforgiveable”. According to the advance briefing of the speech, “the PM will say that the scale of the damage done to the NHS revealed by the report is ‘unforgivable’, recognising the tragic consequences for too many patients and their families”. Starmer will say: People have every right to be angry. It’s not just because the NHS is so personal to all of us - it’s because some of these failings are life and death. Take the waiting times in A&amp;E. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety - it’s leading to avoidable deaths. People’s loved ones who could have been saved. Doctors and nurses whose whole vocation is to save them - hampered from doing so. It’s devastating. The report goes into considerable detail about what is wrong with the NHS. Today we might hear a bit less about how the government intends to fix these problems, but Starmer will set out the outlines of his approach. He will say: This government is working at pace to build a 10-year plan. Something so different from anything that has come before. Instead of the top-down approach of the past, this plan is going to have the fingerprints of NHS staff and patients all over it. And as we build it together, I want to frame this plan around three big shifts - first, moving from an analogue to a digital NHS. A tomorrow service not just a today service. Second, we’ve got to shift more care from hospitals to communities... And third, we’ve got to be much bolder in moving from sickness to prevention. Only fundamental reform and a plan for the long term can turn around the NHS and build a healthy society. It won’t be easy or quick. But I know we can do it. The challenge is clear before us; the change could amount to the biggest reimagining of our NHS since its birth. Here is Denis Campbell and Jessica Elgot’s overnight story. And here is an analysis by Denis, the Guardian’s health policy editor. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: NHS England publishes its monthly peformance figures. 9.30am: The Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its fiscal risks and sustainability report, which looks at long-term risks to the economy. 10am: Keir Starmer delivers his speech on the NHS, and takes questions from reporters. Afternoon: Starmer flies to Washington, where tomorrow he is meeting President Biden in the White House. 3pm: Nick Clegg, the former deputy PM who is now a senior Facebook executive, takes part in a Q&amp;A at Chatham House on democracy and technology.

          "headline": "Teenager arrested over Transport for London cyber attack; ECB cuts interest rates – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The government has tried to strike a collaborative tone at a conference full of private equity and venture capital bosses this afternoon, despite tension over Labour’s plans to close a £500m tax loophole benefiting industry executives. Speaking at the British Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association (BVCA) Summit on Thursday, City minister Tulip Siddiq, issued a call for “action and collaboration” between government and the sector, saying: “I really believe that it’s only by working together that we will deliver greater returns for private capital investors, scale up high growth innovative UK firms, and we will be able to deliver the change and the growth that our country desperately needs.” However, she made no mention of Labour’s proposals to hike taxes on carried interest - which is the share of profits that fund managers in private equity and make on successful deals – to 45%, from 28% currently. The party has said carried interest should be treated as income, since it is effectively a bonus for general partners, and should be taxed as such. It has estimated that doing so would help raise another £500m for government coffers. However, the industry argues that carried interest is a key incentive for staff to find lucrative investment opportunities, including promising companies that are key to UK growth. The government closed a four week consultation on the matter at the end of August, and is expected to announce its final decision on tax levels at the 30 October budget. Time for a recap… A teenager has been arrested following a cyberattack on London’s public transport body last week in which some personal customer data was accessed. The 17-year-old male from Walsall was detained last week, and has been released on bail. TfL said it was contacting about 5,000 customers as a precaution to warn that their email and bank account details could have been accessed. It is understood to relate to those who had applied for refunds on journeys made using Oyster cards. News of the arrest came as BT reveals it identifies 2,000 signals indicating a potential cyber-attack across its networks every second. The UK telco says an “AI arms” race is developing between businesses bolstering their defences and increasingly sophisticated hackers. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates in the eurozone again, but also trimmed its growth forecasts. Britain’s fiscal watchdog has warned that the national debt could almost triple over the next 50 years, as the rising cost of an aging population and climate change push up borrowing. John Lewis has declared it is on track for “significantly higher” full-year profits, after narrowing its losses in the first half of the financial year. The owners of the Grangemouth oil refinery have confirmed it will shut by the end of June next year, in a blow to Scotland’s industrial base and the site’s 500 employees. Here’s our news story about the latest developments in the TfL hack: Shashi Verma, TfL’s Chief Technology Officer, has said that TfL did not expect any significant impact to customer journeys from the cyber attack but that some temporary disruption was possible. Verma added that the transport operator was taking measures to improve security, including an all-staff IT identity check, saying; “We ... are working at pace with our partners to progress the investigation.” Transport for London is warning customers that some personal data has been accessed through the hack. TfL have emailed customers today, saying that they are “currently dealing with an ongoing cyber security incident” which was first detected on 1 September. TfL says that “the situation is evolving”, and that it has identified that certain customer data has been accessed. This includes some customer names and contact details, including email addresses and home addresses where provided. Some Oyster card refund data may have also been accessed. This could include bank account numbers and sort codes for around 5,000 customers, TfL warns. TfL adds: If you are affected, we will contact you directly as soon as possible as a precautionary measure, and will offer you support and guidance. Newsflash: A teenager has been arrested in Walsall by the National Crime Agency, as part of the investigation into a cyber security incident affecting Transport for London (TfL). The 17-year-old male was detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences in relation to the attack, which was launched on TfL on 1 September. The teenager, who was arrested on 5 September, was questioned by NCA officers and has been bailed. The NCA, which is leading the law enforcement response, says it is working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre and TfL to manage the incident and minimise any risks. Deputy Director Paul Foster, head of the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit, says: “We have been working at pace to support Transport for London following a cyber attack on their network, and to identify the criminal actors responsible. “Attacks on public infrastructure such as this can be hugely disruptive and lead to severe consequences for local communities and national systems. “The swift response by TfL following the incident has enabled us to act quickly, and we are grateful for their continued co-operation with our investigation, which remains ongoing. “The NCA leads the UK’s response to cybercrime. We work closely with partners to protect the public by ensuring cyber criminals cannot act with impunity, whether that be by bringing them before the courts or through other disruptive and preventative action.” Last week, TFL was forced to cut some live data feeds serving travel apps such as Citymapper and TfL Go, as it dealt with the cyber-attack. Q: What impact will lower interest rates have on the eurozone economy, given that some – if not most – of its problems are structural? Christine Lagarde cites the new report from Mario Draghi into Europe’s competitiveness, which warns that Europe needs an €800bn EU investment boost and a new industrial strategy. Lagarde believes the European Central Bank’s job would get easier if the proposals made by her predecessor at the ECB were implemented, saying: “Mario Draghi’s report includes so many important structural reforms that are going to be the responsibility of governments that will require the leadership of the Commission and the leadership of those leaders in Europe who are determined to strengthen Europe, to give it more sovereignty, to give it more capacity. “I’m really certain that monetary policy will do what it has to do, which is to provide price stability and to deliver on its mandate, while structural reforms are not the responsibility of a central bank, they are the responsibility of the government.” Q: You say that rates must remain “sufficiently restrictive for some time”; how many times can the ECB cut interest rates until they are no longer sufficiently restrictive? Christine Lagarde declines to speculate as to what the neutral rate of interest (known as r* in economic circles) might be. She argues r* is an unobservable concept – but when the ECB gets close to it, it will have a better feel for it. Q: Does the ECB welcome the news that Italy’s UniCredit has unveiled a 9% stake in Germany’s Commerzbank? Christine Lagarde says the ECB doesn’t normally comment on such commercial moves, but also points out that “many authorities” had hoped to see crossborder mergers for some time. It will be “very interesting” to see how the process unfolds in the weeks to come, she adds. [This morning, the boss of Unicredit said its investment in Commerzbank has laid the basis for talks over a tie-up with the German lender]. Q: Will you know a lot more, or just a little, by the time of your next meeting in October? Lagarde says there are just six week’s until October 17th, a “relatively short” period of time compared to previous intervals between meeting. She reiterates that the ECB will be data-dependent, and is not precommitting to a specific path for rates. Here are the new, lower, growth forecasts from the ECB today: Reaching for a glass of water, Lagarde – who has a little cough - jokes “I drink to the future”. After Christine Lagarde reiterates the key points from her statement, we’re onto questions. Q: Why did the ECB choose to cut its deposit rate by 25 basis points, rather than 50bp? Lagarde says the decision to cut by 25 basis points (or a quarter of one percent) was unanimous, after the governing council had analysed the latest data. That data gives the ECB confidence that inflation is heading towards its 2% target in a timely manner, she says. [eurozone inflation fell to 2.2% in August]. Extreme weather events and the unfolding climate crisis could drive up food prices, which would be inflationary, Lagarde adds. The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside, ECB chief Christine Lagarde warns. Lower demand for euro area exports, due to a weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions, would weigh on eurozone growth, she points out. Growth could also be hit if the lagging impact of tighter monetary policy is stronger than expected, she admits. But on the other hand, if inflation falls faster than expected then growth could be higher. Our interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Lagarde continues. She declares: We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner, Christine Lagarde tells journalists in Frankfurt, adding: We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. ECB president Christine Lagarde is holding a press conference now to explain why the central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of one percent today. She’s reading out the statement released half an hour ago, which explained that the ECB believes it is now appropriate to take another step in “moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction,” due to the inflation outlook. Lagarde explains that the ECB’s headline inflation forecasts are unchanged (as flagged earlier), but adds that projections for core inflation have been revised up slightly. Lagarde then warns that earnings growth is pushing inflation in the eurozone: Domestic inflation remains high as wages are still rising at an elevated pace. However, labour cost pressures are moderating, and profits are partially buffering the impact of higher wages on inflation Europe’s “Faltering economic outlook” has spurred the ECB into action by cutting rates today, says Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG. “Today’s decision to cut interest rates comes amidst a sluggish economic backdrop. Growth in the Eurozone has underperformed expectations with activity likely to weaken in the second half of the year. The ECB may have been wary of falling behind the curve, especially as growth in the Eurozone has lagged behind the US, with the Fed looking poised to cut rates next week. Looking ahead, the path for interest rates remains uncertain, Selfin adds: While there is widespread consensus on the Governing Council that policy restrictiveness should be eased, divergent views remain around the pace of cuts. We expect a further one in December this year, taking the deposit rate down to 3.25%. If the outlook weakens further, it will strengthen the case of more dovish policymakers to increase the pace of cuts in 2025, towards a terminal rate of around 2.25%. President Lagarde once again gave little away in today’s statement, choosing instead to maintain flexibility ahead of the October and December meetings. This will allow the Governing Council to take stock of the data in the coming months as it considers its next move.” Worryingly (although not surprisingly), the European Central Bank has also cut its growth forecasts. ECB staff now expect the economy will grow by 0.8% in 2024, rising to 1.3% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. This is a slight downward revision compared with the June projections, mainly owing to a weaker contribution from domestic demand over the next few quarters, the ECB says. The ECB has also decided to lower its other two key interest rates. The interest rate on its main refinancing operations – the rate banks pay when they borrow money from the ECB for one week - falls from 4.25% to 3.65%. And the marginal lending facility – charged when banks need overnight credit from the Eurosystem – drops from 4.5% to 3.9%. [Back in March, the ECB decided that the gap between the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rate should be 15 basis points.] Newsflash: The European Central Bank has cut borrowing costs across the eurozone, from the second time this year. The interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility, which banks can use to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, has fallen from 3.75% to 3.5%. The ECB’s governing council says: Based on the Governing Council’s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction. This is the second rate cut by the ECB this summer; it started lowering rates from their record high of 4 per cent in June. The ECB says it remains optimistic that inflation will drop towards its 2% target in 2025, explaining: Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, as in the June projections. Inflation is expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous sharp falls in energy prices will drop out of the annual rates. Inflation should then decline towards our target over the second half of next year. More trouble in Europe’s car industry. Manufacturer Stellantis has decided to suspend production of the fully electric Fiat 500 small car for four weeks due to sluggish demand. In a statement, Stellantis says: “The measure is necessary due to the current lack of orders linked to the deep difficulties experienced in the European electric (car) market by all producers, particularly the European ones.” The 500 is made in the northwestern Italian city of Turin, the birthplace of the Fiat brand, at the historic Mirafiori plant. The suspension of production will start on Friday, Stellantis said, adding it was “working hard to manage at its best this hard phase of transition”. UK banks have agreed to open 350 “banking hubs” by the end of the parliament, following a meeting with City minister Tulip Siddiq today. These hubs will offer services like paying in cheques, cash depositing and face-to-face conversations with a Community Banker. The commitment will see around 230 hubs delivered by the end of 2025, with a further 120 rolled out by the end of the Parliament, according to the Treasury. The banks have also agreed to consider having printers in its hubs, to help people print off statements or documents. Before the election, Labour pledged to open ‘at least’ 350 banking hubs over next Parliament, to help customers who have lost their local branch. City Minister Tulip Siddiq says today: “Banking hubs are a lifeline for local communities that have lost their final bank branch. I’m confident that the banks will deliver on the commitment made today, as well as take a more active approach to meeting the needs of local communities.” TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has issued a statement welcoming USDAW’s landmark victory at the Supreme Court against Tesco over proposals to ‘fire and rehire’ workers on less favourable terms. “This is important victory for USDAW - and for workers across the country. “Victorian-style employment practices like fire and rehire have no place in a modern economy. “No company should force staff to reapply for their jobs on worse pay and conditions just to boost profits. “This case is an urgent reminder of why we need the government’s Employment Rights Bill to be delivered in full. “It’s time to end the Tories’ race to the bottom on workplace protections and to drive up labour market standards in Britain.” Boots has promoted its retail director Anthony Hemmerdinger to take over from Seb James as managing director for the UK and Ireland in November. Prior to joining Boots two years ago, Hemmerdinger was chief operating officer at Asda, where he spent six years. He previously held senior operational and strategy roles at Greene King, Sainsbury’s and Carphone Warehouse, after 17 years at Marks &amp; Spencer. James, who led the business for six years, announced that he was stepping down in June just days after it emerged that Boots’ parent group Walgreens Boots Alliance had decided against a sale or stock market flotation of the chain for the second time in two years. The group has shut hundreds of stores and revamped its beauty departments under his leadership. Hemmerdinger said: “I am honoured to be appointed managing director of Boots, one of the UK’s most trusted brands and a place where I began my retail career with my first Saturday job as a teenager. Boots is a terrific business that holds a unique position at the heart of the UK’s health and beauty sector, and I am extremely proud of all we have achieved over the last few years.” Tesco says it accepts the Supreme Court’s judgment in its ‘fire and rehire’ case. A Tesco spokesperson explains: “Our colleagues in our distribution centres play a really critical role in helping us to serve our customers and we value all their hard work. “Our objective in this has always been to ensure fairness across all our DC colleagues. “Today’s judgment relates to a contractual dispute brought on behalf of a very small number of colleagues in our UK distribution network who receive a supplement to their pay. “This supplement was offered many years ago as an incentive to retain certain colleagues and the vast majority of our distribution colleagues today do not receive this top-up. “In 2021, we took the decision to phase it out. We made a competitive offer to affected colleagues at that time and many of them chose to accept this. “Our aim has always been to engage constructively with Usdaw and the small number of colleagues affected.” Ed Miliband, the UK’s Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, says the government will provide support to Grangemouth workers losing their jobs when the oil refinery closes next year: Inflation in Ireland has dropped to its lowest level in over three years, which may cheer the European Central Bank as it prepares to announce its interest rate decision in a couple of hours. Ireland’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.7% between August 2023 and August 2024, down from an annual increase of 2.2% in the 12 months to July 2024. This is the first time since June 2021 that Ireland’s official measure of annual inflation, has been below 2.0%. The head of the TUC, Paul Nowak, says Tesco’s defeat in its ‘fire and rehire’ case is “brilliant news”: BT has revealed that it identifies 2,000 signals indicating a potential cyberattack across its networks every second, and warned of an “artificial intelligence (AI) arms race” as hackers become more sophisticated. The telecoms company - which owns mobile operator EE, the Openreach subsidiary that runs the UK’s broadband network and has international business operations - said that hackers are increasingly looking to weaponise AI for cybercrime. BT’s digital surveillance of its networks has identified a more than 1,200% increase in new malicious scanning “bots” attempting to access systems in the last year. The company said the surge reflects how cyber criminals are increasingly scanning for vulnerabilities through automated, “one time use” disposable bots, in an attempt to evade existing blocking and security measures. “Today, every business is a digital business,” said Tris Morgan, managing director, security at BT, at the company’s Secure Tomorrow conference on Thursday. “Tools like AI provide new routes of attack, but they can also be the first line of defence.” BT said its data showed that web-connected devices are scanned over 1,000 times a day by known malicious sources. The company said that while just over a fifth of scans are for legitimate security monitoring, 78% were malicious indicating that hackers are looking for weaknesses in the online systems. BT said that its analysis shows that while the IT, defence, and financial services sectors are the most popular targets for cyberattacks, sectors such as retail, education and hospitality are becoming an increasingly popular target for hackers. Recent high-profile companies targeted by cyberattacks include Transport for London, which last week was forced to cut some live data feeds serving travel apps such as Citymapper and TfL Go as a result. No customer data was accessed and TfL said the incident was not a ransomware attack. In June, US ticketing giant Ticketmaster, which is embroiled in a backlash over its dynamic ticket pricing strategy for the Oasis reunion tour, was hit by an attack that had the potential to affect hundreds of millions of customers. Ben Owen, the former spy who fronts Channel 4’s Hunted, said that AI has not only lowered the bar for “rookie” hackers but is increasing the volume of possible attacks overall. “Businesses are connecting more devices and adopting new AI tools every day,” said Owen, speaking at the event being held at BT’s Adastral complex near Ipswich. “But hackers are using the same tech to break their defences. It’s an AI arms race that companies can’t afford to lose.” Scotland’s oil industry has just been dealt a blow. Petroineos has confirmed it will close Scotland’s only oil refinery, at Grangemouth, in the second quarter of next year, a spokesperson for the company said on Thursday. Around 400 jobs will be lost as a result of the closure of the 150,000 barrel per day capacity oil refinery, located on the Firth of Forth. A total of 75 jobs will be retained at the site for when it is converted into a fuels import terminal, Reuters reports. Petroineos announced last November that the Grangemouth oil refinery would cease operations as soon as 2025. But there were hopes that jobs could be saved, after Keir Starmer described Grangemouth as a “real priority” in July, on his first visit to Scotland since he was elected as prime minister. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw’s general secretary, has welcomed today’s Supreme Court ruling. Lillis says: “Usdaw has been determined to stand by its members in receipt of this valuable benefit that constituted a key component of their pay. “We recognised that they had been afforded this payment because of their willingness to serve the business and it was on that basis that we agreed with Tesco that it should be a permanent right. “When we said permanent, we meant just that. We were therefore appalled when Tesco threatened these individuals with fire and rehire to remove this benefit. “These sorts of tactics have no place in industrial relations, so we felt we had to act to protect those concerned. “We were very disappointed with the outcome in the Court of Appeal but always felt we had to see this case through. “We are therefore delighted to get this outcome, which is a win for the trade union movement as a whole.” Over in the UK’s Supreme Court, a union has won a battle over Tesco’s plans to “fire and rehire” workers on less favourable terms. Five Supreme Court justices have ruled unanimously today that Tesco should be blocked from dismissing staff at some distribution centres and rehiring them on lower pay, PA Media reports. The case arose after Tesco planned to close some of its distribution centres in 2007 and offered staff increased “retained pay” for them to relocate. In 2021, the chain wished to bring “retained pay” to an end and told staff that the enhancement would be removed in return for a lump sum, or their contracts would be terminated and then re-offered on the same terms, but without the increased salary. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) took legal action over the supermarket chain’s proposals. The High Court ruled in the union’s favour in 2022, but Tesco successfully appealed the decision the same year. The union then took the case to the country’s highest court, and was successful today. Usdaw argued that “retained” pay was described as “permanent” in the staff’s contracts, meaning it could not be removed. Tesco argued that bosses were using a “contractual mechanism” open to employers. In a judgment backed by Lord Reed, Lord Leggatt and Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Burrows and Lady Simler said: “Objectively, it is inconceivable that the mutual intention of the parties was that Tesco would retain a unilateral right to terminate the contracts of employees in order to bring retained pay to an end whenever it suited Tesco’s business purposes to do so. “This would have been viewed, objectively, as unrealistic and as flouting industrial common sense by both sides.” The OBR’s new report also shows how fixing Britain’s health problems would lead to less spending and borrowing, and a lower national debt in half a century: The OBR are posting the key points from their new report on X (Twitter): Chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones has used the OBR’s new Fiscal risks and sustainability report as a weapon to berate the former Conservative government. Jones says: “The OBR has laid bare the shocking state that our public finances were left in by the previous government. “Highest debt since the 1960s, highest taxes since the 1940s and debt on track to be almost three times our GDP. “That’s why this Government began work immediately to address the inheritance with tough choices on spending alongside ambitious action to drive growth. “By fixing the foundations, we will rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better-off.” The OBR’s new report also shows that rising temperatures will hurt the UK economy in the decades ahead. It estimates that around 3% would be knocked off real GDP in 50 years, in a scenario where temperatures rises are kept below 2°C – the goal of the Paris Agreement. But if temperature rises are only kept below 3°C, real GDP would be around 5% lower by 2074. BUT! There are ways to prevent the debt load soaring so high, the OBR adds. The fiscal watchdog explains that if governments tackle the growing pressures on the public finances today, that will lower the term costs. Today’s report explains: limiting the rise in global temperatures to less than 2°C rather than 3°C could alleviate around 10 percentage points of upward pressure on the debt-to-GDP ratio; improving the health of the population could reduce the rise in debt by a further 40 per cent of GDP; and boosting the productive potential of the economy, if it does not simply result in higher public spending, could make the biggest difference of all, with every 0.1 per cent increase in productivity growth reducing the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio by 25 percentage points. A full 1 percentage point increase, equivalent to a return to prefinancial crisis rates of productivity growth, could keep debt below 100 per cent of GDP throughout the next 50 years. Newflash: Britain’s national debt is on track to almost triple over the next 50 years, the UK’s fiscal watchdog has warned. In its latest Fiscal risks and sustainability report, just released, the Office for Budget Rsponsibility warns that the UK – and other countries around the world – face several long-term pressures, such as an ageing population, climate change, and rising geopolitical tensions. Based on current policy and the latest demographic projections, public debt is projected to almost triple from under 100% of GDP to over 270% of GDP over the next 50 years, the OBR says. It explains that the UK public finances will be hit by: an ageing population, with a falling birth rate and the ‘baby-boom’ cohorts moving through retirement putting downward pressure on revenues and upward pressure on spending; climate change, including the fiscal costs of completing the transition to net zero while also coping with damage from rising temperatures and more severe weather; and rising geopolitical tensions, with both the previous and current UK Governments aspiring to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. Those pressures, and other challenges, risk putting the UK public finances onto an “unstainable path” eventually, the OBR fears. It says: Over the next 50 years, public spending is projected to rise from 45% to over 60% of GDP, while revenues remain at around 40% of GDP. As a result, debt would rise rapidly from the late 2030s to 274% GDP in our baseline projection. This chart shows the OBR’s projections. The watchdog suggests that debt is projected to rise further to over 300% of GDP, when further shocks and pressures are taken into account [currently, the national debt is around 99.4% of GDP, or 91.9% of GDP if you exclude the Bank of England]. This is a sobering message for chancellor Rachel Reeves to digest as she draws up next month’s budget. [Incidentally, last year the OBR warned that debt was on an accelerating trajectory to 310 per cent of GDP by the mid-2070s, so today’s forecasts aren’t a radical change]. The OBR suggests today that governments will need to take “mitigating policy action” to prevent a debt spiral taking hold. That means spending cuts or tax rises – or likely both. The OBR says: On our baseline projection, to return debt to its pre-pandemic levels would require an average fiscal tightening of 1.5 per cent of GDP per decade over the next 50 years. European stock markets are rallying this morning, as traders anticipate an interest rate cut from the European Central Bank this afternoon. Germany’s DAX index is up 1.1%, while France’s CAC 40 is 0.6% higher. In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index hit a one-week high in early trading, and is currently up 71 points, or 0.9%, to 8265 points. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say it would be “a major surprise” if the ECB didn’t cut interest rates today by a quarter of one percent this afternoon. They told clients: The market is firmly priced for a 25bp rate cut at next week’, We and the analyst consensus are expecting a 25bp rate cut and most ECB speakers have already endorsed such a move. Slowing economic growth in China has prompted the International Energy Agency to cuts its forecast for oil demand this year. The IEA has trimmed its 2024 oil demand growth forecast by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about 7.2%, to 900,000 bpd. That’s sharply lower than in 2023, when oil consumption rose by 2.1 million barrels per day. In its latest monthly oil market report, just released, the IEA cites a slowdown in Chinese demand as the main driver of weaker global demand growth. The report says: The recent slowdown in China has seen its oil consumption declining y-o-y for a fourth consecutive month in July, by 280 kb/d. The IEA now expects Chinese demand to grow by only 180,000 bpd in 2024 – citing a “broad-based economic slowdown” and an accelerating substitution away from oil in favour of alternative fuels. Budget airline passengers can look forward to lower fares this autumn. Ryanair expects average fares to be 5% to 10% lower than last year for the remainder of this year, group chief executive Michael O’Leary told reporters before the Irish airline’s annual meeting on Thursday, Reuters reports. John Lewis isn’t the only company citing bad weather this morning. Fever-Tree, the mixer maker, has reported that “poor weather in the second quarter across the UK and Europe” hit its revenues in the first half of this year. Temperatures in June were dubbed “disappointing” by the Met Office, which will have deterred some drinkers from an outdoor G&amp;T or ginger ale. The company has now cut its sales forecast – it now expects revenue growth of about 4% to 5% this year, down from previous expectations of growth of about 10%. Tim Warrillow, CEO of Fever-Tree, says the company has seen a much more positive trading performance in July and August, and are optimistic that growth will accelerate in the second half of 2024. Warrillow says: “The Fever-Tree brand performed well against a tough market backdrop. We continued to deliver double digit revenue growth in the US at constant currency, as well as a strong performance in our ROW region. The first half performance in the UK and Europe was impacted by unseasonable weather at the start of summer alongside distributor order phasing in Europe, but we have seen a strong improvement in these regions as the summer belatedly arrived. Shares in Fever-Tree have dropped almost 8% in early trading, to an eight-year low. Sales of beauty products at John Lewis’s department stores rose in the last six months, today’s results show. But fashion sales were hit by “unseasonal weather”, the company says, as well as the cost of living squeeze. Other clothing retailers, such as Primark, have already reported that the wet and chilly summer hit sales. Sales of homewear products were hit by lower demand for ‘big ticket’ items. John Lewis adds that it “performed well in Technology”, particularly with sales of smart wearables and mobile phones. Retail analyst Nick Bubb has dug into John Lewis’s results, and reports: We are delighted that JLP has at last gone back to its previous policy of allocating central and property costs against the two Divisions, so that the operating profit splits are now much more realistic. We are, however, very surprised that Waitrose was much less profitable than we thought on this basis last year and that John Lewis was therefore much more profitable than we’d thought: the adjusted operating margin at John Lewis of 1.7% last year (on ex-VAT sales) was actually higher than the 1.5% achieved by Waitrose (despite its H2 recovery. John Lewis points out that it has historically delivered the majority of its profits in the second half of the year. The company says: As a result, we are confident that full year pre-exceptional profits should be significantly above the £42m we reported in 2023/24. The stronger second-half performance is thanks to the Christmas sales boom (memorably driven by Monty the Penguin a decade ago), and the new year sales. Today’s John Lewis results are the final set before chair Sharon White hands over the reins to her successor, Jason Tarry, the former UK boss of Tesco. On White’s watch, John Lewis has been investing in refurbishing its stores – it will soon complete this work at its sites at Oxford Street, High Wycombe and Cheadle; and nine Waitrose stores. It is also opening of a new convenience store in Hampton Hill in London soon. The value of artificial intelligence pioneer OpenAI appears to have almost doubled, according to reports, as the company seeks fresh resources in a new funding round. Bloomberg reports that OpenAI – the organisation behind the ChatGPT chatbot and and the SearchGPT prototype – is in talks to raise $6.5bn from investors at a valuation of $150bn (£115bn). The new valuation is significantly higher than the $86bn valuation achieved in a tender offer earlier this year, confirming OpenAI as one of the most valuable startups in the world. It’s the latest sign that OpenAI has put last year’s boardroom disruption, which saw CEO Sam Altman fired and then rehired a few days later, behind it. The increased valuation has been achieved despite concerns that the artificial intelligence bubble may have burst – given recent declines in tech share prices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The John Lewis Partnership has declared it is on track to deliver “significantly higher profit” this financial year, as it tries to put a troubled period behind it. In its latest financial results, John Lewis has reported that its losses halved in the first half of its financial year. The company, which owns Waitrose as well as the John Lewis department stores, has made a pre-tax loss of £30m in the six months to 27 July, down from £59m a year earlier. Strip out ‘exceptional items’, such as the cost of strategic restructuring and redundancy programmes, and losses are down by 91% to just £5m. Nish Kankiwala, CEO of the John Lewis Partnership, says the company has achieved a “marked improvement” compared with two years ago. These results confirm that our transformation plan is working and we expect profits to grow significantly for the full year, a marked improvement from where we were two years ago. We continue to invest heavily in quality, service and value, and customers are responding well - with more people shopping with us and customer satisfaction increasing. While we have much more to do, we’re well set up for a positive peak trading period and on target to significantly improve our performance for the full year.” Looking across the company, Waitrose grew its sales by 5% in the first half of the year, but sales at its John Lewis department stores fell 3% – blamed on “a slower external environment for general merchandise”. John Lewis returned to profit in the last financial year (to late January) after three years of losses. Kankiwala says: While we have much more to do, we’re well set up for a positive peak trading period and on target to significantly improve our performance for the full year. The company is hoping that bringing back its “never knowingly undersold” price promise will help it win sales in the crucial Christmas period approaching soon… The agenda This morning: Chancellor Rachel Reeves to meet with UK bank bosses 9.30am BST: UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility to release its OBR Fiscal Risks and Sustainability Report 1.15pm BST: European Central Bank interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless claims 1.45pm BST: European Central Bank press conference"

          "headline": "Republicans point finger at Laura Loomer for Trump’s pet-eating rant",
          "bodyText": "Republicans are blaming the influence of Laura Loomer, a rightwing conspiracy theorist, for this week’s botched debate performance by Donald Trump, which included the former president repeating a bizarre and unfounded claim that pet cats and dogs were being eaten by Haitian immigrants. Loomer flew with Trump on his private plane to Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia and has been identified as a key promoter of the pets rumour, which has been dismissed as false by authorities in Springfield, Ohio, where the practice was alleged to have been taking place. However, Trump amplified it in a moment that has become emblematic of his erratic showing in the debate with Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. “They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump claimed during a debate segment on immigration. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” When the ABC debate moderator David Muir informed him that the story had been debunked, Trump stood by the claim, saying he had seen it “on television”. The rumour had also been disseminated by JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, who in the aftermath of the debate justified doing so. Nevertheless, following the event scrutiny has turned to the supposed role of Loomer. The Semafor website quoted an unnamed source close to Trump’s campaign as saying they were “100%” concerned about Loomer’s sway over the Republican nominee. “Regardless of any guardrails the Trump campaign has put on her, I don’t think it’s working,” the source said. Trump this year proposed giving Loomer an official role on his campaign, but the idea was resisted by staffers. Loomer, who styles herself as an “investigative journalist”, last year promoted a conspiracy theory alleging that 9/11 was an”inside job”. On Wednesday she posted an unfounded allegation that Harris had worn earphones disguised as earrings during the debate. In a sign of resentment among Trump loyalists over her supposed influence, the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene attacked her as “racist” on Wednesday over an earlier post in which she had said the White House would smell of curry if Harris – who has Indian heritage – was elected. “If @KamalaHarris wins, the White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center and the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call that nobody will understand,” Loomer wrote. “This is appalling and extremely racist,” posted Greene, who herself has faced past accusations of racism. “It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA. This does not represent President Trump.” While Trump continues to claim in the face of widespread counter-opinion to have “won” Tuesday’s debate, strategists are struggling to explain why he ignored advice in preparation sessions to focus on Harris’s policies and record in the Biden administration, while resisting her attempts to bait him. Dennis Lennox, a Republican consultant, told Semafor that Loomer’s presence was not the only factor affecting Trump’s performance. “Trump lost the debate because of his performance, or lack thereof,” he said. “That’s what happens when you wing it, live in the Fox News-X bubble, and rely upon Matt Gaetz [the far-right Florida Congress member who helped with debate preparation], let alone Laura Loomer.”"

          "headline": "Graham Rawle obituary",
          "bodyText": "The author, collage artist and designer Graham Rawle, who has died aged 69, of complications related to cancer treatment, once said: “As a kid I was always writing stories, making scrapbooks and magazines, building collections (bubble-gum cards, toy soldiers etc), making up jokes, drawing pictures. None of this seemed like work to me – it’s quite funny that this is now called ‘my career’.” Graham gained public recognition for his collage series Lost Consonants, which first appeared in the Guardian in 1990. Readers were welcomed to a world where children have “leaning difficulties”, firemen wear “fame-resistant clothing” and footballers “get camp in their legs”. The series turned out to have greater longevity than Graham had imagined: “I initially submitted six. As I had lots more ideas and no one at the Guardian told me to stop, I just kept sending them in. There was no real agreement between us, but they always printed them, and I always got paid. I sent them in for the next 15 years.” Later series included Lying Doggo and Graham Rawle’s Wonder Quiz for the Observer, When Words Collide and Pardon Mrs Arden for the Sunday Telegraph and Bright Ideas for the Times. He published eight Lost Consonants compilations followed by a puzzle and games compendium, The Wonder Book of Fun (1993). His first narrative work, Diary of an Amateur Photographer (1998), was a murder mystery using his mastery of collage to give readers visual clues – and providing the solution in a sealed envelope inside the back cover of the book. His friend Roger Ebert, the film critic, called it “sneaky and funny” while Martin Rowson in the Independent on Sunday said it was “beautifully produced … both ingenious and deeply weird”. Graham was born in Birmingham, the son of Denis Rawle, an electrical engineer, and his wife, Jessie (nee Fletcher). He was educated at High Storrs grammar school, Sheffield, and studied graphic art and design at Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire). A consummate guitarist, he toured the US with a Beatles cover band, learning every bass line so precisely that he even included Paul McCartney’s occasional mistakes. He paused his musical career to set up his own graphics studio in London, designing book jackets, advertisements and theatre posters, notably for Kenneth Branagh’s 1986 production of Romeo and Juliet at the Lyric Hammersmith. In 1988, he met Margaret Huber, an artist and teacher at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, when she visited London to assist in the curation of Unusually Good Haircuts, the college’s exhibition of British illustrators. Graham was invited to exhibit and travelled to Minneapolis, returning to the college as artist in residence the following year. He and Margaret married in 1991 and settled in east London, where their home/studio was a warehouse decorated with shop cabinets and mannequins, car-boot finds, toys and guitars. To visit was to enter another world – not unlike some of Graham’s magical creations – where, alongside hard work, generosity, laughter and happiness ruled. In 1999 Graham headed the team of artists that designed the vast Hi-Life Supermarket installation for Expo 2000, a world’s fair staged in Hanover, Germany. The post-apocalyptic artwork was designed to illustrate the consequences of excessive consumerism. Expanding on these themes, back in London Graham assembled a group of artists under the name the Niff Institute, to create a range of limited edition art pieces such as The Non-Specific Tape Measure which accurately evaluated such measurements as “knee high”, “spitting distance” and “too close for comfort”. It was around this time that Graham began work on his most ambitious project – a collaged novel, Woman’s World (2005), created from 40,000 fragments of text clipped from vintage women’s magazines – a labour-intensive process that took him more than five years. He began writing the novel while gathering clippings he thought might be useful. “I transcribed all this stuff to form a kind of phrase bank that could be word-searched, each typed piece carrying with it a volume and page number to identify where the text piece originated. Gradually I replaced all my original manuscript with the found text … now the new words carried with them the voice of the original women’s magazines and I was finally able to paste up the story as artwork.” The Times review described it as “a work of genius”. In 2008 he published a reinterpretation of The Wizard of Oz, illustrating L Frank Baum’s original text with more than 100 images created using collage, photography and model-making. It won Book of the Year and the Illustrated Book award at the British Book Design and Production awards. His final novel, Overland (2018), tells the true story of a 1942 US Army commission to fabricate an entire town on top of the Lockheed aircraft-manufacturing plant in California as camouflage against Japanese aerial attack. In real life, Hollywood art directors created a perfect, seemingly inhabited suburban town; Graham’s twist was to have his fictional characters actually inhabit it. The themes of the text are reflected in the layout – he placed parallel pages one above the other so that the stories of the utopian Overland and the dark industrial underworld are read together. From 2000 onwards Graham taught an MA course in sequential design and illustration at the University of Brighton and was regularly invited to lecture internationally. He was a visiting professor of illustration at both Falmouth School of Art in Cornwall and Norwich University of the Arts, and at the latter was awarded an honorary doctorate. His last project was to be a fully collaged film adaptation of Woman’s World made entirely of clippings from British films of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Ten minutes of footage exists and Graham hoped that other artists would take up the challenge of completing the film. He is survived by Margaret and by his brother, the actor Jeff Rawle. • Graham Rawle, artist and writer, born 22 July 1955; died 16 August 2024"

          "bodyText": "The Trump-Harris debate was the most unsurprising thing that ever happened, except maybe for the part when, unlike previous debates, the moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, pressed Trump to actually answer the question or noted that what he said was extremely not true at all. The former prosecutor and current vice-president Kamala Harris got on stage and spoke in lucid paragraphs that were clearly the result of careful preparation. She shared the stage with the adjudicated sexual abuser who spoke in loose phrases that flapped and looped and circled around and usually reverted to some version of “millions of immigrants who are criminals and terrorists are why this country is in terrible shape worse than anyone thought possible and we are going to have world war three”, a litany of fear and rage and vagueness we’ve heard for eight years. Harris is widely said to have won the debate, by being herself, and being herself included a recurring facial expression of amused incredulity as the convicted felon on stage with her said yet another thing that was extravagantly untrue. One notable aspect of her rhetoric is how centrist it sounds – a bland but presumably strategic affirmation of support for a strong military, more healthcare, the usual Democratic party shout-outs to the middle class and support for Israel but also a two-state solution. She also expertly riled up Trump and let him go, and he went raging and free-associating throughout the 90 minutes. He is said to have lost the debate, also by being himself. His face crumpled into a resentful sulk when his mouth was closed, and it was more than closed at those times – it was clamped shut. But when he opened it, lurid, loopy stuff came out. He actually repeated onstage the grotesquely fearmongering racist untruth that JD Vance and Ted Cruz and other far-right Republicans had been spreading online, declaring: “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” It’s an internet rumor as preposterous as offensive as untrue – one of the moderators actually interjected that it was untrue – but it was also classic Maga stuff, an incendiary distraction from actual policy and anything else that matters. Trump wasn’t quite as incoherent as in some of his recent public soliloquies, but he did say some very odd stuff, such as when he declared of Biden: “We have a president who doesn’t know he’s alive.” His most interesting slip-up came when the moderators asked him if there was anything he regretted about the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress he instigated. He inveighed and he waffled and he wove around and denied responsibility and tried to shift the conversation to Black Lives Matter protests and came back to blame Nancy Pelosi for what happened. But in one telling moment he said “we” of the insurrectionists and then shifted to say: “this group of people that has been treated so bad”. In other words, Trump was Trump and Harris was Harris, but the debate moderators were far, far better than Dana Bash and Jake Tapper of CNN during the disastrous 27 June debate. They and Harris went after Trump when he said, as he’s been saying since at least 2019 in defense of the anti-abortion position, that mothers and doctors are killing babies at or after birth – in other words that abortion rights are the same thing as infanticide (which, yes, is extremely illegal). “They have abortion in the ninth month,” he claimed. “The baby will be born and we will decide what to do with it, in other words they will execute the baby.” It’s the first time to my knowledge that he’s been told to his face that that’s extremely untrue. But still the questions came from within the bubble of assumptions and priorities that drive mainstream American media right now and drive media critics crazy. For example, a question about Harris’s position on fracking was an attempt to have a gotcha moment and portray her as a flip-flopper, and it came long before the final question, which was an afterthought of a throwaway question about climate. Harris’s answer was disappointingly all over the place – “I am proud that as vice-president over the last four years, we have invested $1tn in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels.” Trump didn’t answer the climate question at all, and that was that. The fate of the earth for the next 10,000 years or so was brushed aside, but on the other hand the world’s biggest pop star did choose this evening to endorse Harris, signing herself off as “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady”.

          "bodyText": "If life had panned out the way we imagined, Chris and I would be doting grandparents by now. People who are childless not by choice know that as much as having children changes you, so does not being able to have children when you want them. With five pregnancy losses, the last one 26 years ago, that is us. With the benefit of hindsight, I can now see how having this choice taken away dramatically changed us. It is really obvious to me that we both exhibited the classic signs of trauma and depression during our miscarriages and for many years after. We were both sad, empty, angry at times, lost, anxious and feeling as though there was nothing to look forward to. We compared ourselves to our friends who we thought were all living very happy, successful lives because they were having children easily (in many cases, this wasn’t actually true). There were times when we were just going through the motions: we had stressful jobs that we were committed to that added to our cortisol overloads but we were essentially just getting out the front door each day. Out of work hours we filled the time with lots of activities to release the foofer valve – many lubricated with alcohol. We were doing things that were fun but we felt we weren’t building anything or planning for the future in any way. I can now see why. When you have kids you have to put down an anchor to some degree. You are forced to make decisions that centre around stability and a home base. You need to find childcare, kindergartens, schools and connect with your community in a way you don’t have to without kids. You have humans that literally depend on you for their survival. We felt we did not have that anchor. Sometimes we were flapping in the breeze, feeling as though we had no agency in important areas of our lives and our decisions (or lack thereof) reflected this belief even when there was evidence to the contrary. Trauma is experienced from the first miscarriage and is compounded by each one that follows; it can reinforce your belief you are jinxed or good things won’t ever happen. You are so vulnerable and feel as though you are living in a strange bubble that no one else can see. Many people describe similar feelings when they lose a partner, parent or a child: the feeling of disbelief that you are so consumed by pain and the rest of the world is just getting on with their day oblivious to your devastation. After my fifth and final miscarriage I eventually sought counselling from a free service attached to the hospital. The volunteer peer support counsellor was empathetic but near the end of my only session she handed me five blank birth certificate templates and suggested I take them home and with my husband go through each one and name each lost pregnancy. This exercise, she assured me, would help with our grief and show I had indeed given birth to five children. That I was a mother. It actually made me feel the opposite; it reinforced my belief that I had failed as a mother. Walking out of hospital I felt completely bereft, alone and invisible. I ripped up the certificates and threw them into a street bin, sobbing. I never told Chris about the birth certificates; he just heard about them after reading this article. Today, in our 60s, most of the time we now look through life with a somewhat softened lens. We want to share with others, decades down the track, that it can be hard at times but you can cobble a different life together. We know that being together after more than 30 years is a great achievement and we appreciate each other more and more. Nowadays we try not to focus so much on what we have lost but reflect on the fact we are still here and still together. We have built a life full of people and activities we love and enjoy; we hang out with and feed friends, we love music, eating out, reading, writing, local and global news, going to art events of all kinds, watching sport and movies and being part of a neighbourhood that really gets us. We love mentoring younger people and also learning from them. We meditate using free online resources and walk as much as we can for physical and mental health. And our life is full of children. Having oversized and obvious maternal and paternal urges can have its benefits. We have adorable, now adult, godchildren who we sublimated all our love into from birth and luckily received it back tenfold. We have nieces and nephews and have become aunties and uncles for children of colleagues and friends who embraced our love of their children and our need to spend time with them. We still are that couple who impulsively interacts with unknown babies in the supermarket, on trams, in the street. Most times the babies and parents welcome our gushing and coos. This life stage does reignite feelings of emptiness as we witness the joy of the grandchildren of others. At times we fear a future without – here it is again – the anchor of family; both limbs of our family trees end with us; what happens if we both get sick; where can we find purpose … on and on the voices of fear shrill. Time can go some way to healing the crushing sadness of feeling like you are living a life of “compromise”. A blown-up heart can never completely repair but regular love bombs from godchildren, friends and their children and grandchildren can be pretty great defibrillators. • In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

Not that it has to be a croissant: researchers at Oxford investigated the impact on heart health of a diet high in saturated fat for just over three weeks. It’s bad, if you had any lingering doubt. This comes on the back of admittedly unsurprising, but personally devastating health stories such as the one saying that eating croissants when you are stressed reduces “arterial elasticity” – a very stressful read. I also felt targeted by research on how unhealthy snacking sabotages the benefits of a healthy diet (this week a woman in a cafe asked if I was “having a party” when I put in my cake order; I was not). Then there is the continued drip-feed of doom about sedentary living and poor sleep, and general angst-provoking news about environmental contaminants. Honestly, it’s all just really unwelcome. And I’m pretty sure stressing about ruining my health is bad for my health too, so I’ve come up with a solution: wellness disinformation. There is this notion in the US of people living in a paranoid parallel world maintained by a diet of rolling ultra-rightwing news propaganda and I’m proposing something similar, but for health. Basically, I want to live in a bespoke bubble of vaguely plausible, bias-confirming delusion in which everything is fine, a little of what you fancy still does you good and too much of a good thing is even better. If no Russian bot farm will do it for me, I suppose I’ll have to create my own.

          "headline": "Bridget McKenzie forced to deny her oped on aviation divestiture signals support for breaking up Qantas",
          "bodyText": "The shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, was forced to clarify the Coalition does not support breaking up Qantas just hours after floating the possibility of forced divestiture powers in the aviation sector. McKenzie warned the competition watchdog’s review of the aviation sector “will be a failure if it does not address the role of divestiture” in an opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review on Monday. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Sky News divestiture in aviation is “not Coalition policy yet” and the idea had not gone to shadow cabinet because “it was an op-ed about a review that the government has put out”. He clarified McKenzie had only proposed it as an option “to be looked at” by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. “I think everyone’s taken a step ahead of exactly what Bridget McKenzie said,” he said, in reference to the piece headlined “Is it time to force Qantas to break up with Jetstar?”. In October, a Senate inquiry recommended a review of anticompetitive behaviour in the aviation sector including the examination of divestiture power “to remedy any misuse of market power”. At a doorstop in Canberra, McKenzie said divestiture is “one of the various tools that the treasurer needs to look at” but clarified it was not Coalition policy. “I absolutely have to clarify that … Because it’s clear that the Labor government is seeking to misrepresent my position and the Coalition’s position.” Asked if the Nationals were at odds over the proposal, McKenzie replied: “Not at all. We are very, very keen. The Coalition is absolutely behind the Australian travelling public.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “In my opinion in the AFR, that I hope you have all read, I explicitly rule out needing to break up Jetstar and Qantas; what I do call for, and what I’ve been consistently calling for, and what the Coalition has been consistently calling for, is lower air fares to the Australian travelling public.” Mckenzie was quizzed about the op-ed piece again on the ABC’s 7.30 program last night and she repeated her view that divestiture was “one of the tools” available to the government. In 2023 the Nationals proposed powers to break up major supermarkets but the policy took over a year to develop. Nationals and Liberals alike were surprised by McKenzie’s op-ed on Monday, with the latter urging her to clarify the Coalition’s position on divestiture in the aviation sector. In question time the transport minister, Catherine King, said McKenzie had woken up with a “big idea”, which she said would see the budget brand “go the way of Tiger Air”, a brand owned first by Singapore Airlines, then Virgin and shut down in 2020. “You would think any serious political party would have thought deeply about such a significant policy,” King said. “But this thought bubble didn’t last the light of day. While Australians were still having breakfast the member for New England [Barnaby Joyce] and Senator [Jane] Hume refused to back it in, quite rightly, and just after breakfast the leader of the Nationals, quite rightly, killed it dead for ever.” The divestiture threat comes after a prolonged period of public discontent with Qantas, climaxing with its recent acknowledgment it misled customers by selling tickets for thousands of flights it had already cancelled. It has nonetheless emerged from the turbulent period with fewer competitors, after the recent collapse of Bonza and axing of the inter-capital city network by Rex. The former watchdog Allan Fels said on Monday divestiture powers should be incorporated into competition law to be wielded by the courts when there are significant breaches of market power. “Whether it should apply to Qantas or others would be up to the courts, but an actual serious breach of the law would need to be proven, and then a court would have to conclude that divestiture would be the best remedy, rather than a fine,” Fels told Guardian Australia. Angel Zhong, a finance researcher and associate professor from RMIT, said Australia was known internationally for having several industries with high market concentration, including the airline sector. Zhong said forced divestments would require careful consideration. “It would require careful regulatory oversight because your desired outcome is that it will improve competition, and you want to make sure that you achieve that without unintended negative consequences,” she said. “For example, you could [inadvertently] undermine the financial stability of the airlines involved and the employment opportunities of many Australians.”"

Here’s what’s been keeping us busy this Monday: The federal parliament accepted the final royal commission into defence and veteran suicide report, which was tabled by defence minister Richard Marles, who said the government would respond to the report’s 122 recommendations in a “timely manner”. Industrial action season is upon us, with New South Wales nurses on strike tomorrow and rail workers planning strikes from 18 September. The Health Services Union is calling for 12 days of reproductive leave to be made standard nationwide. South Australia is forging ahead with plans to ban children who are under 14 from social media, while the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, followed suit. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie has called for divesture powers for airlines, specifically, threatening Qantas with the forced sale of its low-cost brand, Jetstar. The Queensland opposition has promised to create a public child sex offender register named for murder victim Daniel Morcombe. And, in case you missed it, the government will reinstate LGBTQ+ questions in the next census. Thank you for joining us, we’ll be back tomorrow morning. NT chief minister Finocchiaro takes on police portfolio Over to the Northern Territory, where chief minister Lia Finocchiaro has kept her election promises to tackle crime by taking on the crucial police portfolio and introducing a new ministry to accelerate development in the territory. Finocchiaro pledged she would take on the police, fire and emergency services ministry in the lead-up to the Country Liberal party’s crushing election victory, where it won 17 of 25 seats, reports AAP. The chief minister has also given herself defence and a newly created role of Territory coordinator, which she promised during the election campaign would speed up development and funding approvals. The role was first proposed by Finocchiaro in opposition in 2020, but was voted down by the Labor government. She said the Territory voted for change and her new cabinet would focus on rebuilding the economy and addressing crime after the landslide victory against Labor on 24 August. “The CLP has been given a mandate to deliver change for all Territorians and our new cabinet will ensure a better Northern Territory for everyone,” Finocchiaro said. Community safety is my government’s first priority and we are on track to deliver our promised reforms on bail and increased police powers in the first week of parliament. Gerard Maley will be deputy chief minister and take on mining and energy as well as the renewables portfolios. Finocchiaro made good on another election promise by putting youth detention back into corrections. The critical ministry will be overseen by Maley. Nurses across New South Wales will strike tomorrow, with the state’s minister for health urging those with less serious conditions to seek alternatives to emergency departments while they deal with the disruption. Ryan Park said that the Industrial Relations Commission on Friday issued a recommendation that the NSW Nurses &amp; Midwives Association should cease the proposed strike action tomorrow. Hearings were ongoing today to seek to avoid impacts to patient and community safety. He warned that the strike action will affect the public health system, from longer waits in emergency rooms to cancelled non-emergency surgeries. In a statement, the minister said: While all local health districts have plans in place to minimise disruption, the strikes will very likely affect people seeking care. We assure the community they should not hesitate to go to their local hospital for emergency care. All patients will be seen and triaged on arrival at the ED and, as always, the most seriously unwell patients are treated first. Tomorrow, we expect to see people with less urgent conditions experience longer wait times, with seriously unwell patients being prioritised for emergency care. NSW Health has also already started to contact people across the state whose planned surgeries will need to be postponed because of the strikes. We remind the community of alternative options already available to them for less urgent minor conditions and keep emergency departments and ambulances for saving lives. Nothing is more important to me as minister for health than investing in our essential health workers. Victorian premier floats age limit for social-media use The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, says the state will place age limits on social media platforms to help protect children. In a social media video released on Monday afternoon, Allan announced the government would consult with parents, children and teachers about placing new rules on social media use – but she did not specify an age. Allan says social media is “just not a place for kids before they’re ready”. It harms their development and it hurts their focus. It’s not just parents telling me that, it’s kids and young people too. It’s time to give parents the power to push back. Not against kids, but against tech giants. The South Australian government has drafted a bill to ban children 13 and under from using social media. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has previously said he believes 16 would be the right age limit for social media, while the Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has floated 14. For an Explainer on this issue: ANU student wins appeal against expulsion for pro-Palestinian activism A student at the Australian National University says winning her expulsion appeal is a “victory for all students” who have faced disciplinary action for their pro-Palestinian activism, vowing the “fight will continue” on campuses. Beatrice Tucker was suspended in May and became the first Australian student to be expelled a month later for comments she made refusing to unequivocally condemn Hamas on ABC radio. A petition calling on her expulsion to be retracted collected more than 1,200 signatures in the following three months. Tucker said: At campuses across the country, students have faced disciplinary action for speaking out to free Palestine and for taking action against the genocide in Gaza ... it can never be a crime to uphold the right of oppressed people to resist occupation ... the fight to cut all of ANU’s ties with the Israeli apartheid state and the Labor government’s support for genocide will continue. The Zionist Federation of Australia president, Jeremy Leibler, said it was “beyond comprehension” that ANU has overturned her expulsion, labelling it a “failure of leadership”. He said: ANU is setting a loud and clear precedent to other students that they can say and do whatever they want with zero consequences. A spokesperson for ANU told Nine Newspapers it didn’t comment on specific disciplinary matters but took seriously “any alleged behaviour or speech that contravenes our values as a community, and which go against our codes of conduct”. Sydney commuters could once again face delays on the train network as the union pledges to shut down a major line amid opposition to Metro conversions. The NSW Rail, Tram and Bus Union told members it would suspend all work on the T3 Bankstown Line from 18 September if the NSW government does not negotiate on the Metro upgrades, the AAP reports. “Forcing a genuine conversation about the Bankstown conversion – one that hits on the facts and isn’t manipulated by a distracting shiny new toy,” the union said in a statement. “At the core of these actions is ensuring that trains continue to run on the Bankstown Line and it is not closed as planned to deliver the Metro conversion.” The union says the conversion of the T3 line between Bankstown and Sydenham would be unsafe and while Metro is the “fad of the month” the Bankstown line is a “different beast”. “Automation for the sake of automation,” it said. “It’s easier to bargain with machines than unionised workers.” The planned action will involve a ban on all work on the T3 line and a pledge to only work the timetable as it stands on Monday. The planned strike is the most significant action the union has threatened against the Minns Labor government. Thank you, Amy Remeikis. Let’s get on with the remainder of today’s news: Norway’s defence minister emphasises linked nature of Europe and Indo-Pacific The visiting Norwegian defence minister, Bjorn Gram, says that northern Europe and the Indo-Pacific are not as dissimilar as might immediately meet the eye. Speaking with Afternoon Briefing, he said: We have a war going on in Europe. The Russian attack on Ukraine. We see that countries like China and North Korea are facilitating the Russian ability to attack Ukraine in different ways. So that’s one illustration of how these two regions are more and more interlinked. Focusing closer to (his) home, he would not be drawn on Ukraine’s calls for permission to use long-range missiles. “We don’t comment on terms of rules and engagement that we do for our donations to Ukraine. But, of course, Ukraine has totally aligned with international law when they also attacked Russian military capabilities within Russia proper,” he said. And, while Gram wouldn’t comment on a US election outcome, he said Trump “had rhetoric that was difficult for Nato … I think when it comes to the security situation in the higher north, there are also some American interests there. I think when everything’s settled down, our cooperation will continue to grow in a positive way.” The parliament is starting to slow down, but the Canberra team will keep an eye on everything that is happening for you. I will hand you over to Daisy Dumas for the rest of the evening – but I’ll be back early tomorrow morning for more politics live (and party room meeting day! Hurrah!) Until then – take care of you. Marles says Labor will respond to report ‘in a timely manner’ How will the government respond to the report? Richard Marles: I’m not going to go into each and every recommendation as you probably would imagine, given that the report has literally just been handed down. But I want to make a couple of points more generally. We very much support the thrust of the royal commission. We believe that the work that it’s done is profoundly important and that the report itself is profoundly important. Without knowing – or still in the process, I should say, of going through the specifics of the recommendations, we do understand the direction in which the royal commission has gone. And we will support the thrust of the recommendations that are made. We want to take the time, obviously, to go through each of them. But in taking that time, I also want to make this point; we will respond to this shortly. And in a very timely manner. We understand how important it is to that there is clarity provided in terms of the government’s response and we will make that happen. Marles acknowledges importance of transition back to civilian life for defence personnel Richard Marles is speaking about the royal commission report on the ABC and he is asked about one of the issues which was raised – transitioning back into civilian life. He says: I think transition is a really important issue. And I think there are gaps around the question of transition. So I do recognise that. And this has been a focus of the royal commission’s efforts. When I appeared in front of the royal commission myself, which was an unusual step for a sitting minister to appear before a royal commission, this was very much a focus of the royal commission at that point, and I made clear in my testimony then that I understood the significance of transition as an issue. We need to get it right. I think the other point that was certainly being made by the royal commission throughout its hearings is that there’s been a lot of work by a lot of different reports and investigations and inquiries in the past. They want this one to make a difference. So in terms of having a standing body, they see that as being an important part of that. Again, without responding directly to the recommendation, we absolutely are committed to making sure that this royal commission makes a difference and that its recommendations last. Major strata insurance broker and underwriter Steadfast Group has suspended trading on the ASX today after a story in the ABC this morning alleged the company had engaged in misleading its clients. The allegations included that a Steadfast-owned broker, engaged by a Sydney owners’ corporation to provide insurance quotes for their residential building, had recommended a more expensive policy from a Steadfast-owned firm while hiding a cheaper quote from a competitor. The article was a teaser story ahead of an episode of Four Corners, scheduled to air tonight, called “The Strata Trap”. In a statement to the ASX, Steadfast requested the trading halt until such time as it had made a statement in response to the ABC’s story, or the opening of trade on Wednesday morning – whichever came first. The story also prompted the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, to call for strata insurance commissions to be banned. She told the ABC: There are a set of hidden arrangements that are … not disclosed, but also circumvent disclosure of fees … The receipt of hidden payments and commissions of whatever nature is misleading consumers. The tabling of the royal commission report into defence and veteran suicide As the parliament accepted the final royal commission into defence and veteran suicide report, Tanya Plibersek made her way to the speakers’ gallery where Julie-Ann Finney was sitting. Finney was understandably emotional, given what she has been through to get to this point. Mike Bowers said Plibersek looked up and saw Finney, and made her way upstairs to comfort her. (No one is allowed to take photos or footage of the galleries, unless the speaker acknowledges someone specifically by name or title) Question time through the Bowers lens Here is a bit more from how Guardian Australia’s photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, saw Question Time: Further recommendations on responses to veteran suicides (Continued from previous post) Also among the recommendations: Improve organisational culture and leadership accountability to increase member wellbeing and safety. Amend the annual performance appraisals of ADF leaders (from the rank of colonel to the rank of general) to include upward feedback from their direct reports and assessment against outcomes-based targets related to culture, health and wellbeing. Codesign “a new doctrine recognising that operational readiness depends on a healthy workforce”. Understand the prevalence and effects of military sexual trauma and improve responses to support victims and “prioritise the prevention of sexual misconduct in the Australian Defence Force” Improve the military justice system, including having the inspecto -general of the Australian Defence Force initiating an inquiry “into the weaponisation of the military justice administrative system by the end of 2024”. Have an inspector general inquiry into all deaths of serving members “unless suicide can be excluded as the cause of death”. Reduce stigma and remove structural and cultural barriers to help-seeking. Increase the Department of Veterans’ Affairs fee schedule so it is aligned with that of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Establish a new executive agency focused on veteran wellbeing, to have “distinctive branding” but be “administratively nested within” DVA. Improve the ability for future royal commissions to undertake their work, including amending the Royal Commissions Act “so there are meaningful consequences for noncompliance with a compulsory notice” and “allow royal commissions timely access to material covered by public interest immunity”. A look at the royal commission’s recommended responses to the issue of defence and veterans suicide Returning to the royal commission’s 122 recommendations, some of the key ones include: Establish a new statutory entity to oversee systemic reforms “across the whole defence ecosystem” and provide “independent oversight and evidence-based advice” to improve suicide prevention and wellbeing outcomes for serving and ex-serving ADF members. Improve support for all recruits in training “to build resilience and embed help-seeking behaviours”. Mitigate the adverse effects of the posting cycle on ADF members and their families, including “measures to reduce the frequency of relocation” and to better support family members. Support all serving members “to decompress, rest and reintegrate, especially after high-risk experiences”. Opposition reactions to a slice of fried gold(mine), in pictures Mike Bowers was in the chamber and caught Sussan Ley having some thoughts, feelings and emotions during Tanya Plibersek’s answer on the goldmine tailings dam. There isn’t too much to say about the return to QT other than to point out that Peter Dutton did not ask a single question. It is all back to the cost of living and inflation and how Labor is managing the economy, at least from the Coalition side of things. After finishing the last parliament sitting without asking about the economy, it is a return to what the Coalition said it would focus on at the beginning of the latest reset (there have been so many of them). Let’s see if it keeps up during the week. The House moves on to the next order of business, returning to the Future Made In Australia legislation debate. Barnaby Joyce says ‘something wrong’ when veterans are more likely to die as civilians than while serving Barnaby Joyce also speaks on the tabling of the royal commission report: We have a responsibility in this nation that when someone signs their name on the dotted line, therefore they offer their life for this land, that we protect them when they come home. There is something wrong when a person is more likely to die once they’ve finished their service and get back on to civvy street then [when] they are actually in the service. And this is something that I hope on a bipartisan level. We work to our very best, and I’d like to acknowledge the minister here at present to get to expedite this process, get it through, get it resolved out of respect for those who have died. The royal commission report, tabled in parliament a short time ago, states: The number of deaths by suicide among those who serve or have served in the ADF is unacceptably high. Between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2021, there were 2,007 confirmed suicide deaths of individuals who had served at least one day in the ADF since 1 January 1985. An average of 78 serving or ex-serving ADF members have died by suicide each year for the past 10 years. This equates to an average of three deaths every fortnight. As large as these numbers are, they underestimate the scale of the problem. These figures do not include deaths by suicide of veterans who separated from the ADF before 1985, thereby excluding many Vietnam veterans. In addition, these figures underreport suicide deaths before 1997, as death records from this time were not as comprehensive. These figures also only include deaths officially recorded as suicide, and therefore exclude deaths where the intent of the deceased could not be determined. The rate of suicide among serving and ex-serving ADF members has persisted over time. The suicide rate for males serving in the permanent forces was 13.9 per 100,000 population per year in 1997–99, and 14.4 per 100,000 population per year in 2019–21. The suicide rate for ex-serving males was 26 per 100,000 population per year in 2005‒07, and 28.4 per 100,000 population per year in 2019‒21. - Support for veterans and their families is available 24 hours a day from Open Arms on 1800 011 046 and Safe Zone Support on 1800 142 072. Report into defence and veteran suicde contains 122 recommendations The three-year royal commission, which was led by the former New South Wales police deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas as chair alongside two fellow commissioners, heard evidence from more than 340 witnesses. It also conducted almost 900 private sessions and received more than 5,800 submissions. The seven-volume report – presented to the governor general, Sam Mostyn, this morning and then tabled in parliament after question time – includes 122 recommendations. The commissioners state in their foreword: Whether the work of this royal commission will contribute to a reduction in rates of suicide and suicidality among serving and ex-serving personnel now largely depends on the Australian government and its agencies: the Australian Defence Force, the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. As commissioners, we insist that it is both necessary and possible to reduce the number of deaths by suicide and experiences of suicidality among serving and ex-serving ADF members. Our sailors, soldiers and aviators deserve to receive the protection and support they need to thrive, grow and heal, both during their time in service and beyond - Support for veterans and their families is available 24 hours a day from Open Arms on 1800 011 046 and Safe Zone Support on 1800 142 072. Hayat Line is a free and confidential crisis support line for Muslims on 1300 993 398. Marles says Labor will carefully consider recommendations from report Richard Marles in a statement said: I thank the members of our defence force, our veterans and their loved ones who bravely shared their stories with the royal commission. This has been a thorough inquiry, and we will take the time to carefully consider the recommendations of the final report. Our priority is ensuring that those who pursue a career in the ADF have a safe and inclusive workplace and are supported from the time they join, through transition, and after service. Richard Marles is now tabling the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide’s final report. He acknowledges Julie-Ann Finney, who is in the gallery watching, for her role in pushing the commission. Once tabled, it will be made public. The government response will take some time though. - Support for veterans and their families is available 24 hours a day from Open Arms on 1800 011 046 and Safe Zone Support on 1800 142 072.

Catherine King takes a dixer so she can say this: Now, of course, we all woke up this morning to see the shadow transport spokesperson having a bit of a big idea. She’s decided that she wants to [direct the] divestiture of Jetstar, breaking up aviation. Seeing Jetstar go the way of Tiger Air. This significant policy, you would think … any serious political party would have thought deeply about such a significant policy. But this thought bubble didn’t last the light of day while Australians were still having breakfast. The member for New England [Barnaby Joyce] and Senator Hume refused to back it in, quite rightly and just after breakfast, the leader of the Nationals [David Littleproud] quite rightly killed it dead forever. That’s it. He not only confirmed that it hadn’t been to shadow cabinet, he said, and I quote, ‘well, it’s not Coalition policy because we haven’t got the evidence’. By lunchtime, not even Senator McKenzie backed Senator McKenzie. She was forced to front a press conference, walking back her comments – another evidence-free and damaging thought bubble from people who’ve proved once again why they can’t be trusted with managing Australia’s economy. The only divestment the Liberal party should have a good look at and now consider, is divesting themselves of this loose National party. And question time ends. Chalmers says opposition ‘desperately want a recession in this country to serve their political purposes’ Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh asks Jim Chalmers: Why does the treasurer blame everyone and everything for his failings from the former government? Covid, [the] war in Ukraine, global economy, financial instability and the RBA governor herself? Interest rates have come down in the UK, Canada and New Zealand, so why won’t the treasurer take responsibility for the weakest GDP growth outside the pandemic since Paul Keating’s 1990s recession? Someone from the Liberal benches yells “have a go at that, Jim!” Jim does. They couldn’t even stick with the shadow treasurer for one full question time. They had to go up the back! He’s told to get to the answer. Well, a couple of things about that. First of all, the honourable member made the point about interest rates in other countries. A number of the other countries that those opposite site have got higher unemployment than us and they’ve got higher interest rates than us and their inflation peaked higher and earlier than us. And so if they want to make comparisons with other countries, make the full comparison, you know, do they want the much higher unemployment that we see in some of these countries that they cite – Canada and New Zealand and the like? And so they should be upfront about that when they ask these questions with international comparisons. Now we know that they desperately want higher interest rates to serve their political purposes. We know that they desperately want a recession in this country to serve their political purposes. Liberal MP Tony Pasin booted out of question time The member for Barker, Tony Pasin, is booted from question time. Pasin was eight 94A removals behind the Liberal booted out of question time champion, Michael Sukkar. Is he launching a last minute challenge to the title? Fletcher and Dreyfus tangle over anti-domestic violence funding package Mark Dreyfus takes a dixer on the family and domestic violence funding package announced following national cabinet on Friday. He is partway through: This investment in legal assistance will ensure that those services can help more Australians. This investment in legal assistance services will ensure that these services can help more women, including First Nations women, safely leave and recover from violent relationships by providing ongoing funding to the sector. We help in the destructive uncertainty created by the former government. Now, legal services can hire new staff, they can take up new premises, they can plan with confidence for the future. The Liberals saw oversaw a decade of chronic underfunding … Paul Fletcher stands up with a point of order and Dreyfus addresses him directly: I know you don’t like it, but you’d better listen! Milton Dick tells him Fletcher can ask a point of order. Fletcher: It was, in fact, a commendably tightly drafted question. There was no reference to alternative approaches. The attorney general of all people, should be able to follow the standing orders and control his temper. Yeah, you should control your temper! Fletcher yells this last line, which sort of undermines his point. Marles acknowledges Sharkie’s concerns on potential sale of Woodside barracks in Mayo Independent MP Rebekha Sharkie asks the sort of local member question that question time should be used for: The Woodside barracks, established in 1927, is historically, militarily and economically important for my Mayo community. The base also hosts over 100 Army and Air Force cadets, regional young people, many of whom are interested in a military career. Minister, will the Woodside barracks remain an operational base and will you rule out selling off the land as [is] currently speculated? The defence minister, Richard Marles, says: As the member would be aware, the government has undertaken a review into the defence estate to ensure that the defence estate is the appropriate platform that it should be for the defence force that we need and for the defence force to achieve the strategic aims that we need it to achieve in what is a very difficult world. I’m not going to go into the specifics of any defence site and walk down the path of that before the government releases its response to the estate review. We are currently in the process of working that response through. We’ve received the report from those who have undertaken it. We need to be ensuring that all the implications in relation to personnel associated with the thorough review of our defence estate are completely worked through, and that will take some months to do that. It is not our intention to respond to the review until some time next year because of the work that is involved in relation to that. Having said that, I acknowledge what the member has said about the Woodside barracks and its significance, of course, for pretty well every member of this place, they will have a part of the defence estate within their electorate. Defence is one of, if not the biggest landowner in the country. And so this is an important process to go through. But as I say, the government is working this through in detail and I’m very happy to brief the member at greater detail at a later stage. Agencies prepare for potential outbreak of H5N1 bird flu Australian government agencies across agriculture, threatened species, environmental protection, emergency management and health are warning Australians of the risk of an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian flu, which has killed tens of thousands of birds and other animals around the world. The country’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said there was no evidence the H5N1 strain was spreading in Australia nor that it would cause serious illness in humans but Australian agencies were nonetheless planning for a possible outbreak. There have been 14 cases in the US, for example, this year, in relation to H5N1 – this particular strain of H5N1 influenza – and they have all been mild, mainly conjunctivitis and mild respiratory disease … So [while] we are very alert to this and very alert to the potential for human infection, we are not alarmed at this stage because of this experience in other countries. The emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said agencies were participating in the final stage of Exercise Volare on Wednesday, designed to wargame a whole-of-government and industry response to a hypothetical outbreak: Exercises like this stress test our preparedness. They help us understand what we’ll need to do to communicate should an incursion take place. The disease is spread by migratory birds but has killed more than 500 species of birds and animals worldwide, with water birds and marine mammals particularly vulnerable along with species already under threat of extinction. The National Animal Disease Preparedness commissioner, Brant Smith, said the greatest risk of H5N1 entering Australia was via the east Asian Australasian flyway, a migratory bird path which stretches from north Asia down through south-east Asia, across Australia and New Zealand and on to the western Pacific. He said diseased birds would often die suddenly and sometimes in large numbers. He urged anyone noticing affected birds to call the emergency animal disease hotline. The hotline number, published on the department’s website, is 1800 675 888. Plibersek says her decision on goldmine matches that of Liberal predecessor After points of order on relevance, Tanya Plibersek says: It is the same group of traditional owners and I’m going to table the map that shows the two projects are about 50km apart. About half an hour’s drive. It’s also the same type of decision I made a declaration under the Act, I made a declaration under the Act in the same way the previous minister did, a section 10 declaration. I will table that. I made [it for] the same reasons as the minister. I’ll read to you from her press release: ‘the decision acknowledges the cultural significance that this area has for the Wiradjuri people in contributing to local Aboriginal narratives, songlines, ceremonies and cultural heritage’. It’s the same reasons. I was asked about the reasoning, and I am explaining the reasoning and just the fact that you don’t like it [isn’t enough]. And I’ve said to the company that I will provide them with the statement of reasons we’re going to deal with this. David Littleproud asks Plibersek to defend decision on McPhillamys goldmine The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, asks the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, about this: To be very clear, the goldmine has not been blocked. Tanya Plibersek’s order was about the tailings dam (where waste goes) and where it was being built. The goldmine itself has not been rejected. With that in mind, here is Littleproud’s question: Regis resources has confirmed the Blayney goldmine is no longer viable following the minister’s decision to block a critical part of the project against the local Aboriginal land council. Why won’t the minister release the statement of reasons for her decision that’s jeopardised a $1bn investment, some 800 jobs, and create sovereign risk that will see companies withdraw investment from Australia? (Sovereign risk! Drink!) Plibersek: It’s interesting that he suggested that the company doesn’t believe the project is viable, because the chairman has just bought 15,000 extra shares. And one of the other directors has just bought more than 10,000 extra shares with his wife, the CEO and his wife, through [a] trust, more than 10,000 extra shares. Just to be very clear here, I have not blocked the goldmine. What I said [is] of this 2,500 hectare site, 400 hectares ought to be protected. I have done it on the basis of advice from the same group of traditional owners, as the former minister for the environment, the … now deputy leader of the opposition [Sussan Ley], and I want to table the picture of the former minister meeting with the same group of traditional owners. Chalmers says Labor recognises tough economic times and says they want ATO to recognise it as well Jim Chalmers says in response to that question: [Thank you] to the member for North Sydney for raising the genuine concerns that I know she has about the ATO’s debt collection activities. And I also want to acknowledge the member for Warringah [Zali Steggall] who raises these matters from time to time with me as well. This is something that I speak with the tax commissioner about, from time to time. Because I do understand that in the context of an economy where growth is slow and subdued, where consumption is weak, particularly when it comes to discretionary spending, I do know a lot of small businesses like a lot of Australians are doing it tough. And so we do need to make sure that when the ATO does its important work, recovering tax debts, so we make sure there’s a level playing field between the people who do their best to keep up-to-date and those unable to, we need to make sure there’s an even playing field, but whenever these activities are undertaken, we need to make sure they’re undertaken in the most sensitive and understanding way they can be. My advice to small businesses who are in the situation that you describe, the member for North Sydney describes, I would encourage them to engage as early as possible with the ATO to come to the arrangements they need in order to keep doing the important work they do. From our point of view, we’ll continuing doing what we can to support small business, whether it’s help with energy bills, the tax breaks and in other ways, we’re big supporters of small business. We know it’s a tough time for them. And we want the ATO to recognise that as well. Independent MP Kylea Tink asks ATO to recognise tough economy in debt collection processes Independent MP Kylea Tink asks Jim Chalmers about this ongoing story: Jonathan Barrett broke that story and has continued to stay with it. Tink asks: Will our economy recording the weakest annual financial growth in years, small-to-medium size businesses are struggling. These business owners from North Sydney and beyond, and tax experts, have raised serious concerns about the ATO’s aggressive debt enforcement action increasingly targeting them. Will your government issue a mandate to the ATO to ensure that debt collection processes are conducted in a way that recognises the tough economic times? And now Angus Taylor has a new question for Jim Chalmers. This might be a new record! Last week’s national accounts reveal the true impact of Labor’s economic failures. KPMG chief economist Dr Brendan Rynne says the government “has its foot on the accelerator, the Reserve Bank’s foot is on the brake, it’s stalling the economy.” Why is the government fighting the Reserve Bank and leaving Australian families going backwards? Jim Chalmers: I’m asked about the government’s position and the Reserve Bank’s position. And honourable members and the public beyond, should be aware that the governor of the Reserve Bank has - has herself said that we are completely aligned when it comes to the focus on inflation and being concerned about maintaining the gains in the labour market. Her quote “we’re completely aligned on this,’. Governor Bullock also said on 5 June, “I think that fiscal policy has been running a surplus, so that’s helping the home-grown inflation”. Another very similar point that Governor bullock has made - and I’m surprised, given she said it twice, that the Shadow Treasurer didn’t notice it. On 16 August Governor Bullock said “public demand is not the main game here, it’s not the thing we’re focused on.” On 5 September she said, “Government spending is not the main game here.” If they don’t want to take my word for it, take the word of the governor of the Reserve Bank. The governor of the Reserve Bank has made it clear we’re aligned when it comes to the fight against inflation, it’s one of the reasons why we’ve got inflation down from a six in front of, it to a three in front of it right now. We know the price pressures are more persistent than we would like, that’s why it requires ongoing effort. The primary focus is the fight against inflation, as is the Reserve Bank’s. We know we need to do that without ignoring the risks to growth and the pressures that people are already under. If those opposite were in office, we would be in recession right now, they’ll be running huge deficits and that would have implications. We’re managing the budget responsibly. It’s the third year of a parliamentary term and they don’t have any policies. Liberals continue economic attack lines on Labor Angus Taylor is back again! This time he asks Anthony Albanese: Despite Labor’s pre-election promises, under this government living standards have fallen by nearly 9%. The household savings rate is down 10 percentage points, personal income tax payments are over 25% higher and a home owner with a typical mortgage is over $35,000 worse off. Why won’t the prime minister admit his government has been a disaster? As more Australian families are working harder and longer but still going backwards? Albanese: Well, the shadow treasurer, I thank him for his question. He’s exhausted his annual quota of questions to the Treasurer in one morning. His answer works through the same areas Jim Chalmers covered off in his earlier answers, so I will save you from having to read any of it. Crossbenchers appeal for Labor to make environment changes with them, not opposition The Greens and David Pocock are teaming up in the Senate to push the federal government further on changes to outdated environmental laws. Senators Sarah Hanson-Young and Pocock said on Tuesday the Albanese government should work with the minor party and crossbenchers in the upper house rather than cut a deal with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton. The government’s legislation proposes establishing a new environment protection authority and a separate new agency that would manage environmental information and data. The Greens senator said the government had an opportunity to consider the climate in federal environmental decision-making rather than “rolling out the red carpet for the mining industry and for Gina Rinehart”. Hanson-Young said: Don’t run away and hide behind Peter Dutton and Gina Rinehart, roll up your sleeves, let’s get to work. Let’s actually protect Australia’s environment. Specifically, the Greens want loopholes allowing native forest logging closed, as well as considerations for climate change under federal laws. Pocock said it appeared Labor was terrified of upsetting the mining industry and that its elected representatives “aren’t actually standing up for their community”. The nature positive laws require the support of either the Coalition or the Greens and three crossbenchers to pass into law. Lidia Thorpe also reiterated her support for passing the bill, encouraging the government to improve the inclusion of First Nations communities in environmental governance and decision-making. There’s nothing positive about continuing to allow destructive industries and multinational corporations to drive us into a climate and ecological catastrophe, or excluding First Peoples and our expertise from laws that will have such a significant impact on country. Chalmers counters Coalition critiques over inflation and cost of living Jim Chalmers continues: Now, more broadly when it comes to the fight against inflation, I take responsibility for our part of the fight against inflation. I take responsibilities for surpluses when those opposite only delivered deficits. I take responsibility for $80bn in savings when those opposite had none in their last budget. I take responsibility for banking all of upwards revisions for revenue. I take responsibility for helping the Reserve Bank governor fight inflation without ignoring the risks to growth. And I won’t be taking lectures from those opposite, Mr Speaker, who left us huge deficits and a trillion dollars of debt. They left us with inflation with a six in front of it and rising. The same people who cheer for higher interest rates and a recession because it serves their political interests. The same people who would have us in recession right now, but with no help for people doing it tough, and lower wages. The same people who can’t tell us where those $315m in secret cuts are coming from. The same people who don’t have a costed or credible alternative policy. As the governor said, the government and the governor are aligned when it comes to the fight against inflation. We’ve got the same objective, but we’ve got different responsibilities. I take responsibility for our part in the fight against inflation. And we are making welcome progress since inflation was north of 6% when you were in office. Chalmers continues to defend economic record against Coalition attacks It is Sussan Ley time! Last week, the Treasurer accused the RBA of smashing the economy. Then, Labor’s national president, and the treasurer’s mentor, Wayne Swan, said the RBA is “punching itself in the face.” Treasurer, why does the Albanese Labor government think it’s acceptable to bully the independent RBA in this way when they’re all doing is cleaning up Labor’s economic mess? Why is the government fighting the Reserve Bank of Australia, [while] Australian families go backwards? There are immediate questions over whether this question breaches standing orders. Ley is asked to repeat it and does and the question is ruled in order. Jim Chalmers: A number of elements to the question. First of all, the governor of the Reserve Bank doesn’t consider it the way the deputy leader has said. That’s the first point. She made that clear ... (There are so many interjections, the speaker, Milton Dick, threatens to bring out Dugald and warns everyone to shut it – it is a joke within Queensland politics that when the usually affable Dick is cranky, Dugald, the speaker’s legal name, has taken over.) Chalmers continues: The governor made it clear she doesn’t agree with the assessment put forward by the deputy leader. Second point is I’m asked about cleaning up the mess, it’s ironic, when you consider the mess we inherited, turning the deficits into surpluses, getting real wages moving again, inflation is half the peak of what it was in the year we were elected. In terms of the rest of the question, it is self-evident, it is a factual point to say that a combination of global economic uncertainty and persistent price pressures and high interest rates are slowing our economy. If the opposite don’t agree, they don’t know the third thing about the first thing about the economy. Anyone who looks at this objectively knows that higher interest rates are slowing our economy. We saw it in the numbers for consumption, discretionary spending, we saw it in a number of indicators in the national accounts. Albanese says ‘we paused process’ on LGBTQ+ census questions ‘to get it right’ Anthony Albanese: The 2026 census will include sexual orientation and gender for the first time. The ABS came to the government with potential changes it planned to trial, including changes it had not recommended for the 2026 census, we paused that process to get it right. And that’s precisely what we have done. The government’s position follows further engagement with the community and additional discussions with the ABS. We ensured, for example, the only people aged over the age of consent will be asked questions on the new topic. And that people can choose not to answer. Now, regulations to add this new topic will be finalised before the end of the year. This is how you get a commonsense solution by working with people, in the order to achieve the objective that we have set, and when I sat in my first term as a member of the House of Representatives, I was the first person to move a private member’s bill to give equity for same sex people for any bill brought before the House. That goes back to 1988, and every since then, I have argued the case for equality regardless of people’s sexual orientation, regardless of their identity, regardless of their race, regardless of their faith. What the census is about is recording the state of Australia in 2026, and that’s precisely what it will do. (There will be no questions in the census on variations of innate sex characteristics – that is, questions on intersex Australians. The ABS has said they don’t think questions in the census would be very reliable on that front.) Stephen Bates questions PM on LGBTQ+ census issue Greens MP Stephen Bates is up (still without a tie – we love the commitment to the bit. For those who don’t remember, possibly because they have lives, the Nationals in particular were very upset when Bates and fellow Greens member Max Chandler-Mather first sat in the parliament because of their lack of ties. Turns out ties are not in the dress standard, so the ties remain banished from the Greens benches.) Anyway, Bates asks Anthony Albanese: Why did you make a captain’s call to not include LGBTIQ+ people in the census, and do you think the pain caused by this decision underscores the need for an LGBTIQ+ human rights commissioner? PM praises contributors to royal commission into defence and veteran suicide as Dutton pledges bipartisen support Anthony Albanese has acknowledged the imminent release of the royal commission report into defence and veteran suicide will be “a difficult day for many people”. The report is expected to be tabled in parliament shortly after question time, and that is when it will be publicly released. The prime minister told parliament he wanted to acknowledge everyone who contributed to the royal commission, including ADF members, veterans and their families, saying their desire to drive change were an act of courage and selflessness: For many this has meant revisiting the darkest moments of their lives. Albanese said royal commissions had a special capacity to drive change, including making Australia “face up to our collective failures”, and promised that the government would “thoroughly consider every recommendation” and work across the parliament on the issues. The PM said that just as veterans and ADF personnel stepped up for Australia “we have an obligation to step up for them”. He described “lest we forget” as “Australia’s most solemn promise” which included a promise to “remember the fallen, to honour their sacrifice, to care for the loved ones who are left behind, and to ensure all those who have worn the uniform of this nation have access to the support and services they need and deserve”. Albanese said the release of the report would be triggering for many people. He encouraged anyone who needed support to contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Open Arms on 1800 011 046. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, rose to speak on indulgence, saying he would “join with the government on what is necessarily a bipartisan response to one of the most critical issues facing our country”. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 and for veterans specifically Open Arms is on 1800 011 046 Taylor and Chalmers spar over economic issues Angus Taylor is back! It’s double Angus. Brilliant. Fantastic. Great move. Can the treasurer confirm that since the Albanese government was elected, Australian families have suffered a bigger fall in real disposable income per person than any other OECD country? Having already worked through his delight that Taylor is asking him questions, Jim Chalmers moves into reflection mode (which also includes leaning on the despatch box like it is a pulpit): We understand the pressures on living standards and that’s why we’re doing something about it. That’s why we’re rolling out cost-of-living support that those opposite don’t support. That’s why we are giving a tax cut to every taxpayer … It’s why we’re helping people with their energy bills. It’s why we’re helping with what people pay at the pharmacy. That’s why we’re providing rent assistance. It’s why we’re doing cheaper early childhood education. It’s why we’re getting wages moving again after a decade of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression. So, if those opposite really cared about living standards, they would support our efforts to help people with the cost of living but they don’t. If those opposite cared about living standards, they would support our efforts to get wages moving again but they don’t. In fact, they want people working longer for less, we want people earning more and keeping more of what they earn. When we came to office, real wages were falling 3.4%. Now they’re growing again. That’s not an accident. That’s deliberate. That’s because of the policy agenda of this Albanese Labor government Paul Fletcher is not happy with the answer and has a point of order on relevance. Chalmers is told to stay on topic. I have acknowledged that people are under extreme pressure. I have acknowledged that. But more than acknowledge that, more than acknowledge that, Mr Speaker, we’re doing something about it. And only one side of this parliament cares about the pressures that people are under. And that’s why we’re rolling out cost-of-living help. It’s why we’re cleaning up the mess they made of the budget. Chalmers claps back at Liberals over economic attacks Angus Taylor has a point of order on relevance. He is not happy with the compare-and-contrast Jim Chalmers has been undertaking. Chalmers is advised to stick to the issues in the question and says: I’m speaking the madness of pulling billions of dollars out of an economy that’s already weak in nominal and per capita terms. We have managed the economy responsibly … we have maintained a primary focus on inflation, but not ignoring the risks to growth and the pressures people are under. Per capita growth went backwards on a number of instances under those opposite as well. We understand the economy is particularly soft right now. It would be even softer if those opposite had their way, their approach to cuts in the budget, Mr Speaker, would be a recipe for recession. We found a way to keep the economy growing at the same time as providing cost of living relief and get the budget into much … He runs out of time. After two weeks of almost no questions on the economy or cost of living from the opposition in the last sittings weeks, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor is straight into it: The treasurer confirmed that Australia has been a household recession for the past six-quarters? And that this is the longest straight run of falling per capita output on record? Jim Chalmers seems energised: There he is. He is there, after all. He is there after all. What a relief for all of us, that he is. Mr Speaker, as I said, when the national accounts came out last Wednesday, the Australian economy barely grew in the June quarter. That’s true in nominal terms, and it’s true that the economy is weak per person as well. And that’s why it would be diabolical if we poured $315bn out of the economy as the shadow treasurer wants us to do. If we had taken the free advice of those opposite, if we had taken their advice, the economy would be in recession right now. The economy would be in recession right now. When we came to office, inflation had a six in front of it, and was rising. Interest rates were going up. Deficits as far as the eye could see. Real wages were falling when we came to office, Mr Speaker. And because of our collective efforts, we got wages moving again. We’re rolling out cost of living relief. And if they truly cared, Mr Speaker, if they truly cared about household incomes in the country, they wouldn’t have called for an election over our tax cuts. Question time looms … Well time just flies when you’re having fun (or an existential crisis, depending on which way you look at it) and we are now in the downhill slide to question time. So grab what you need to get through it – we will be here waiting. ACTU chief addresses criticism over actions in response to CFMEU allegations The Australian Council of Trade Unions chief, Sally McManus, has attempted to address some of the criticism over the reaction to the construction arm of the CFMEU on social media. McManus says that “this isn’t unionism” in her short video; Karen Andrews on gender quotas – video We reported on this earlier this morning, but here is Liberal MP and former home affairs minister Karen Andrews speaking on her changing attitude to quotas: Pups and politicians Seeing eye dog puppies were let loose in a parliament courtyard. It went as you would expect. After various Coalition figures (Barnaby Joyce and Hollie Hughes) backed in the “give the ACCC airline divestiture powers” call from Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie in an op-ed in the Financial Review, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has poured a bucket over it, saying it is not Coalition policy. It hasn’t been to the party room apparently. So now McKenzie, whose name and photo is on the op-ed, is also “clarifying” her position. The SMH reports McKenzie held a doorstop (quick press conference) explaining her position – she wants the treasurer to “actually look at all the tools on how he’s going to address the excessive air fares that Australians are continuing to pay”. Which apparently is not divesture. Liberals on TikTok Peter Dutton MP (verified) on TikTok has gained three new followers on the Chinese social media app since this morning. He now has 22. So we thought it might be fun to have a look over some of the comments from Coalition MPs about TikTok. Here was James Paterson in March this year: TikTok is a bad faith actor, it is a risk to our democracy; it’s a risk to our national security and the government should take action here to protect Australians from this very serious threat. Also Paterson in March: TikTok is a national security threat for Australia for the same reason it’s a national security threat to the United States. And here is Dutton himself, from February: Speaking to Sky News Australia’s The Kenny Report on Thursday, the opposition leader pushed for TikTok to be banned on the premise of its “exploitative” presence in the cyber space but did not explicitly allude to Chinese interference in the platform’s operations. If photos of young kids are being scraped from their accounts and stored by a third party, whether it’s a country or state actor or whether it’s an organised crime group, then the prime minister has to act If data is being scraped by the terabytes off these accounts and young people are being exposed to extortion at some point, or [it’s] just their personal data being collected, it’s not a safe platform. Chalmers’ trip to Beijing comes as Chinese economic funk spells uncertainty for Australia As Jim Chalmers noted on Sunday to the ABC’s Insiders, the treasurer is headed to China later this month, the first such visit for about seven years. How much time Chalmers will have to assess the state of the economy outside the official meetings remains to be seen. (The sense this holidaying correspondent had in three provinces last month was that the economy is very much in a funk.) Since China accounts for the largest share of consumption for most commodities, what happens in that economy has a big impact on the value of Australia’s exports. Chalmers told Insiders the drop in commodity prices “could cost the budget something like $4.5bn”. We’ve sought a clarification of that figure. Yes, commodity prices are wilting, with iron ore dropping below $US90 a tonne in Singapore today for the first time since late 2022, according to Bloomberg. Coking coal used in steel making, too, was down “around 40%” since the start of this year, Chalmers said. (It’s trading at about $US177/t.) However, Treasury is typically conservative in its commodity price forecasts. The 2024-25 budget, for instance, pencilled in iron ore averaging $US60/t and coking coal $US140/t. So, unless the market crumbles further, those estimates should be exceeded - and the budget will gain an upgrade if they do. Reinforcing the “funk” view of the Chinese economy, producer prices in August were 1.8% lower than a year ago, far worse than July’s 0.8% decline (and economists’ estimate of a 1.5% drop), Bloomberg reported. Consumer prices rose but less than expected. No doubt something for the treasurer to chat about in Beijing later this month. Amended net zero authority bill passes Senate Having passed the net zero authority amendments from the Senate (meaning the bill has passed), the house has moved on to the amendments being put forward on its Future Made in Australia legislation. Andrew Leigh has announced Australia has signed a new tax treaty with … Slovenia! It’s the first tax treaty between the two nations (fancy that) and Leigh says represents “a significant milestone in the bilateral relationship”. Once in force, the treaty will enhance trade and investment opportunities between Australia and Slovenia by creating a more favourable regulatory environment and producing new opportunities to enhance economic cooperation. The treaty will give Australian businesses new opportunities to access Slovenian capital through reduced withholding tax rates. This will lower costs for Australians investing in Slovenia and will improve access to Slovenian technology. Leigh reports that last year, trade between Australia and Slovenia amounted to $411m and $215m in bilateral investment. Lidia Thorpe brands national cabinet funding for community legal services ‘smoke and mirrors’ Independent senator Lidia Thorpe says the national cabinet domestic and family violence funding package will mean that community legal services will still struggle to meet growing needs. Thorpe said that with just $800m of the $3.9bn funding package going to legal assistance services over the next five years, the announcement was “just smoke and mirrors”. It isn’t a substantial new funding commitment, it’s mostly a rebrand of existing funding arrangements. The Albanese government is focused on getting a good headline, not on what will work for communities. It’s good that the government says they want to take action on domestic and family violence, but this weak commitment falls significantly short of what is needed. Net zero authority bill is before the House The House is considering the Senate amendments to the net zero authority bill. That vote is happening, but the government is in agreement, so it won’t be long until that is passed. Griffith University to establish Brisbane CBD campus in former Treasury building There have been questions over what the former Brisbane CBD historic Treasury building would be used for after the Star casino officially left the premises for the Queen’s Wharf precinct (you can read about some of the dramas with all of that here). Griffith University has announced it is taking over the building and establishing its Brisbane City campus: This landmark development will serve as a hub for the University’s business, information technology, and law disciplines, as well as a centre for postgraduate and executive education. The acquisition of the lease for this heritage-listed building marks a significant milestone for Griffith, expanding its footprint into the heart of Brisbane’s CBD. By 2035, the city campus is expected to be home to approximately 7,000 students and 200 staff, offering a state-of-the-art educational environment fostering innovation, collaboration, and engagement with the broader community. Andrews: ‘the appointment of people on merit is often used to stop people from progressing’ Karen Andrews finished that speech with: Now, historically, we have always been of the view that you get preselected based on merit but sometimes you look around and you think, well, maybe merit only applies in certain circumstances and basically merit and the appointment of people on merit is often used to stop women from progressing, so what I would like to see is that there is an openness, there is an understanding of what the issues are that we face [and] one of those is to make sure that we recognise that there is a need to ensure that we have more women sitting in parliament. Now, I have stated publicly on many occasions that I think the preselection processes of my own party need to be looked at to make sure that there is opportunity for all people to be able to put their hands up to be preselected as a member of this parliament and representing a political party if they choose to do so or if they are choosing to be an independent. What I have said before and I say again, if we want to make change here, we cannot simply cross our fingers and hope that things are going to change unless we take positive action because doing that in the past has been an abject failure. You may have seen Karen Middleton’s story with Julia Gillard on quotas, with the Labor party acknowledging 30 years of its affirmative action policy: There has been a motion debate on that issue in the house. Outgoing Liberal MP Karen Andrews decided to make an speech on the issue: I graduated from university with a degree in mechanical engineering which I am incredibly proud of and have always considered myself to be an engineer first and foremost and of course, even back then there were significantly less women that were undertaking engineering studies and there are now. There are clearly not enough. I have spent my entire what life working in male-dominated industries and my entire life fighting to make sure that women [are] treated equally and given the opportunities that boys and men have … that was clearly a much easier task in engineering because … when you went on to the factory floor, you were treated very equally based on your ability to actually do the job. As I move through my second career which was in industrial relations, I experienced similar issues as to what I had in engineering where as long as I could do the job I was generally accepted what I needed to do. My third career has been, is, politics. And when I was first elected as the member for McPherson, they were clearly discussions about that there was greater representation of women in parliament and issues of quota or targets has been discussed by the Coalition are many, many years and initially I would have to say I have always been opposed to quotas because I never wanted to be considered to have been appointed into a role for anything other than my ability to do the job. What I have seen over the last decade at least has made me soften my views into opposing quotas. My concern is that the parliament of Australia needs to be a parliament that truly reflects the people of Australia. That means that there are a number of groups, for want of a better way of describing it, that need representation in the parliament. One significant group is women. I look at this side of the house and I look at the female representation that we have here and I am absolutely convinced that we need to do better. We need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to promote this as a workplace that is desirable for women to enter. We need to promote from the Coalition’s point of view, in my view, as a welcoming place for women to be part of. Veteran suicide commission chair says some ‘simply didn’t care enough to tackle the problems’ In his press conference outside Parliament House, the commission chair, Nick Kaldas, was pressed to elaborate on his claim of a failure of leadership on the issue of suicide of Australian defence force members and veterans. Kaldas said: When there’s been dozens of inquiries, hundreds of recommendations, and no one’s gone back to check whether they’ve acquitted the intent of the recommendations, I’d say that’s a failure of leadership. What is clear from some of the horrible stories that we’ve heard is that many people simply turned a blind eye, over many years and felt that it was too hard, or they simply didn’t care enough to tackle the problems. Having said that, we have come across many, many really motivated, excellent people, both within the ADF and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, who have tried their best within the system. Kaldas raised issued with the approach taken by government lawyers in particular. Asked about the level of cooperation with the royal commission, he said: I think there’s been systemic issues such as relying on parliamentary privilege for reports that have been tabled in parliament, therefore making it impossible for us to rely on or use those reports. That sort of problem is something that we’ve recommended [action on] in the first interim report, and there’s been discussion since to try and address. We’re aware that we’re not the first royal commission to raise these issues, and the Australian Law Reform Commission has, in fact, made recommendations along the lines we’d like to see. Let’s return to that press conference from earlier with the commissioners who conducted the inquiry into defence and veteran suicide. The commission chair, Nick Kaldas, said the royal commission should be a “line in the sand” and a “call to action once and for all”. He told reporters outside Parliament House that he believed there had been a “failure of leadership”, noting there had been dozens of past inquiries and hundreds of past recommendations “and the dial hasn’t moved”. Kaldas said he hoped that if the royal commission had achieved one thing, it was that the problems were now “undeniable”. He hoped the recommendations to be released later today were approached in a bipartisan manner rather than as a political issue. He also paid tribute to serving members, former members, and loved ones who relived their trauma and shared their experiences with the royal commission in the hope it did not happen to anyone else. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Leigh says ABS recommendation was that intersex questions would not have produced reliable data On why there will be no questions on variations of innate sex characteristics, Andrew Leigh said: We went with a recommendation from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the survey questions that had been proposed wouldn’t have produced reliable data. We recognise there are a group of intersex Australians born with variations of sex characteristics. We need to do a better job of counting those Australians. But the survey question which had been proposed, according to the experts in the Australian Bureau of Statistics, wouldn’t have produced reliable data. Leigh says LGBTQ+ census questions match Labor commitment in national platform Asked to explain to the host “like I am a 10-year-old” how the mess happened, Andrew Leigh said: I’ll leave others to talk about the internals. I’m pleased with where we’ve ended up, which I think is the right approach. We’ve got an appropriate balance here. We’ve recognised we’re able to ask questions which will count LGBT+ Australians in a way in which they weren’t counted before. That’s a commitment that Labor has in our national platform. And I understand, too, and you haven’t asked about it, but this is important. There was a proposal around intersex status. We weren’t able to have a question there that the ABS was confident would produce reliable data. We’ll continue to work with the intersex community to ensure that they’re counted in future surveys. Leigh on census questions: ‘I think we’ve arrived at the right result’ The assistant minister for treasury, Andrew Leigh, was asked on Canberra ABC radio this morning about the census debacle and “why it had to be like this” in terms of adding additional census questions about gender and sexuality. Leigh said: We’ve always sought to listen to people and in this case, I think we’ve arrived at the right result. We’re led by a prime minister who is as committed as anyone in the parliament to inclusivity of LGBT+ Australians. This is a Prime Minister who, back in 1997, whose first term in parliament, moved a private member’s motion to have superannuation for same-sex couples recognised. He was a strong advocate for marriage equality and was then the first sitting prime minister to march in the Mardi Gras. So, I think everyone recognises his strong commitment to the LGBT+ community, and that’s reflected in the decisions we’ve made here. Royal commission into defence and veteran suicide report has been received The governor general, Sam Mostyn, has received the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide. There were seven volumes and more than 100 recommendations. The report will be tabled in the parliament, but we will have to wait some time before the government response is made public. Victorian premier confirms gas stove ban not part of net zero plan The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has confirmed a ban on gas stove tops will be excluded from its net zero roadmap. The government released a plan in 2022 which included incentives for households to replace gas water heating and space heating with efficient, low-emissions electric equipment while phasing out incentives for all gas products by the end of this year. This would have required households to replace broken gas appliances with electric options. Speaking to reporters, Allan confirms the policy, saying the government has “listened to the Victorian community”: I want to be really clear today for Victorians, that Victorians can continue to keep cooking with gas, that gas will be there for their cooktops, for their stoves. Allan says Victorians will be able to cook on their existing gas stove and replace it if needed. She says the government is also committed to helping Victorian households transition to electric appliances and renewable energy. With polling showing that the Liberals could win in Goldstein and Curtin, there is renewed focus on what teal independent MPs are doing to withstand the campaigns. Zoe Daniel says she is just getting on with the job: In case you missed it: government to reinstate LGBTQ+ questions on census For those who missed it, here is the official statement from Andrew Leigh on the reinstatement of questions on gender and sexuality in the census. But there will not be a question on variations of innate sex characteristics. Leigh said yesterday: The Albanese government is setting a new topic of ‘sexual orientation and gender’ for inclusion in the 2026 census. This will allow the Australian Bureau of Statistics to ask questions on sexual orientation and gender for the first time, in keeping with their recommendation to government. These questions will only be asked of people aged 16 and over, and the ABS has told the government that people will have the option not to answer. The new topic reflects consultation with the ABS’s LGBTIQ+ expert advisory committee, including key peak bodies in the sector. The ABS did not recommend a topic on variations of sex characteristics (intersex status) in the census, and it will not be included. Although this topic was considered by the ABS, testing indicated high-quality data could not be collected due to the technical complexity of the topic. The government will continue to work with the intersex community about ways of gathering information in other ABS surveys. We value every Australian, regardless of their faith, race, gender or LGBTIQ+ status. The government’s position follows further engagement with the community and additional discussions with the ABS. The government will make a legislative instrument to implement these changes, and will introduce this instrument before the end of the year. Commissioners hold presser on report into defence and veteran suicide The commissioners overseeing the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide will officially hand over their report in the next half an hour. Ahead of the trip to Government House, they held a brief press conference at parliament. So you want to start an Australian airline? Here are all the reasons you can’t Given the airline discourse, it is worth revisiting this from Elias Visontay and the video team: Coalition considering changes to aged care legislation ahead of vote Last sitting fortnight we reported that Labor and the Coalition had reached in-principle agreement on changes to aged care to increase the element of users pay. But the government wouldn’t release the legislation until the opposition committed to vote for the whole thing. We understand that the Coalition was given the full bill last week, not just the section responding to the aged care taskforce, and will consider it at their party room meeting on Tuesday. So final approval is coming soon, unless they spot something else in its 500-plus pages they don’t like that sets negotiations back. What we know so far: The government dropped its proposal for criminal penalties for directors for sub-standard care. The reforms will involve greater user-pays for aged care residents, particularly with respect to residential accommodation and food The Coalition had pushed for those changes to be grandfathered so they didn’t bite those who were currently on waiting lists Queensland opposition proposes public child sex offender register The Queensland opposition has promised to create a public child sex offender register named for murder victim Daniel Morcombe. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, said the register would have three tiers, including a publicly available website with photos and personal details of offenders who have “failed to comply with their reporting obligations or provided false or misleading information to police”. People will also be allowed to apply for even more information on “high-risk offenders living in a local area”. At tier three, parents and guardians will be able to inquire about a specific person who has regularly unsupervised contact with their child. Crisafulli said the register would put the rights of children, victims and parents ahead of the rights of dangerous predators. He said: My LNP team and I are focused on reducing the number of crime victims in Queensland and if this register protects just one child from becoming a victim, it is a decision we must make. I’d also like to acknowledge the advocacy of the Morcombe family who through unimaginable tragedy have fought to keep children safe. These law changes will be attributed to an innocent young boy from the Sunshine Coast and forever known as Daniel’s Law. In 2003, the 13-year-old was abducted and murdered by Brett Peter Cowan, who had two previous convictions for child sex abuse. Morcombe’s parents have long called for a sex register. Western Australia is the only state with a public register, established in 2012. South Australia is considering a similar policy. Research shows that sex offender registries do “not have a statistically significant impact on recidivism” by sex offenders. Many experts regard Australia as having some of the weakest prevention programs in the western world. Independent parliamentarians Sophie Scamps, Monique Ryan and David Pocock have held a press conference calling for the federal government to end the exemption for native forest logging under regional forest agreements. Scamps also called to clean out the board of the NSW Forestry Corporation. Scamps noted that the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, had shown some willingness to end regional forestry agreements but there was no timeline, and they could be in place until 2040. She called for the change to be made before Australia hosts a world nature positive summit. Pocock said the environmental protection bill that passed the lower house was “a farce” because the proposed environmental protection agency would have no independence if the board can’t pick its own chief executive. Businessman and veteran environmental campaigner Geoff Cousins said he “can promise” there will be electoral campaigns and consequences for the federal and NSW governments if they don’t take action, promising to do “everything” he can to ensure it. Ryan also urged voters to remember inaction at the election. Cousins said failure to ban regional forest agreements showed the federal government’s commitment to no new extinctions was “feeble”. Matt Thistlethwaite continued: What we need to see is, of course, conditions that encourage more competition. And one of those big issues in Sydney airport, in my electorate, has been slot management, and the previous government sat on that for ten years and did nothing about it. We acted, we brought in a new system to manage those slots to make it easier for new operators and competitors to get into that market, to get access to those slots. I think that the Western Sydney airport coming online in a couple of years will make a big difference and there will be an opportunity for new players to come into the market. But it’s also a factor that we don’t have a very big market here in Australia compared to Europe, Asia and the United States, unfortunately. And we’re going to make the best of what we’ve got and make sure that we put in place measures to encourage as much competition as possible. Thistlethwaite rejects Coalition call to force Jetstar divestment Given the government response to the call for divesture powers when it came to the supermarkets, you can already guess where Labor is going with the call for divesture powers for airlines (hint: they are not fans). Matt Thistlethwaite, the assistant minister for immigration, confirmed that in the same Sky News interview with Hollie Hughes: Well, we all want to see more competition and cheaper fares, but this is a crazy economic policy. Let’s say you do divest Qantas of Jetstar. Who buys it? And if no one buys it, then you’re left with less competition in the aviation market and we’re all worse off. They’re the questions that the Coalition’s been unable to answer with this ridiculous economic policy. Let’s play “guess who said this”. They are speaking about the Nationals’ push to have the ACCC receive divesture powers for the major airlines. It’s not about free markets when you’ve got basically a monopoly. We’re not talking about a free market, and we know that it’s not just the airlines. You know, when you look at the airports and the landing spaces and where those capabilities are for new entrants into the market to participate, it’s very, very difficult because of landing fees, but also access to gates. So, there does need to be a wholesale review. … And what Qantas is doing with its airfares is helping contribute to higher inflation because we know those airfares are continuing to rise. If you guessed Liberal senator Hollie Hughes – congratulations! Dreyfus signals lawyers, real estate agents and gem dealers to come under increased money-laundering scrutiny The attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, has signalled the government is about to turn its eye to “tranche two” entities in the renewed focus on money laundering. What is tranche two? It is lawyers, accountants, trust and company service providers, precious metals and stone dealers and real estate agents – anyone who could be used to wash money. Dreyfus: Australia needs to remain vigilant and harden our businesses against exploitation. The Australian Government is committed to strengthening our anti-money laundering regime through these reforms which are critical in protecting Australians and our economy from the impact of transnational, serious and organised crime. Dreyfus says the government will be modernising the legislation that deals with money laundering “to ensure it keeps pace with the increasingly digital, instant nature of our global financial system – closing those gaps that we know increasingly sophisticated, professional criminal organisations can exploit”. He is responding to a report on the issue – which you can read on the AIC website. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responded to Joyce: They’ve only got one idea. Break up the supermarkets, break up the airlines. What we actually have to do with the airlines is make sure that takeoff and landing slots, there’s more competition there. The previous government got a report years ago recommending just that. We’re implementing it right now. Barnaby Joyce backs call for Qantas to be forced to divest Jetstar Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce appeared on the Seven Network this morning promoting the idea that divesture powers should be applied to the major airlines. Bridget McKenzie wrote an op-ed in the Financial Review calling for the power, particularly in terms of Qantas (the idea being if prices and service didn’t improve, Qantas could be threatened with the forced sale of Jetstar). Joyce: I think it’s important that if the study clearly says that we don’t have the competition, then we’ve got to do something about it. You’ve got to remember Qantas destroyed Bonza, and Qantas has destroyed basically Rex by their control of the marketplace. And we can’t just sit back and say, “well, that’s all right. We’ll just have a monopoly in Australia”. No other country would put up with this. The United States would not put up with this, so why would we? I am old enough to remember when Peter Dutton wanted to ban TikTok in Australia (March, 2024) – but he is now gracing the social media platform with his official presence. Peter Dutton MP (verified) has 19 followers. Three weeks ago we would have said this is very demure and mindful, but much like Brat summer, that is over (we truly pity whoever in his office has to explain social trends to Dutton). The parliament will sit from 10am this morning. You can find the house’s daily business here and the Senate’s here. (All things subject to change of course, because – parliament.) The government’s response to online privacy reforms will be a little clearer this week – Paul Karp has taken a look at what that will mean (and more importantly, what it won’t). More than 70% of Centrelink recipients cutting back on meals, medications and seeing friends due to cost, Acoss says The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) has a new report showing that almost three-quarters of people on jobseeker, youth allowance and the parenting payment are cutting back on meat, fruit and vegetables, because they can not afford it. Three in four are also struggling to afford their medications. The research found: 71% are cutting back on meat, fresh fruit and vegetables. 51% are skipping meals altogether. 74% are having difficulty affording the medicine or medical care they need. 92% said that the low rate of income support harmed their mental health and 84% said it harmed their physical health. 68% are cutting back on heating or cooling their homes, 54% are cutting back on using lights, and 42% go to bed early to save money. 81% said they use their car less than they would otherwise and 87% see friends and family less often. 94% of people renting privately are in rental stress, paying more than 30% of their income on rent. Acoss is calling on the government to: Lift income support payments to at least the pension rate, currently $80 a day, and index to wages as well as price movements. Establish a disability and illness supplement to recognise the additional costs that people with disability and chronic illness face. Establish a single parent supplement. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie has written for the AFR calling for divesture powers for airlines. Specifically, threatening Qantas with the forced sale of its low-cost brand, Jetstar. “[The government’s] competition review will be a failure if it does not address the role of divestiture in the Australian aviation sector,” McKenzie writes. McKenzie, expanding a Nationals call for more divesture powers, which includes the major supermarkets, says that the threat may be one of the only ways to ensure competition in the Australian aviation market. Peter Dutton endorsed the Nationals’ call when it came to supermarkets, despite discomfort from some Liberals. The Coalition did not move on divesture powers while in government for almost a decade, despite the original threat against energy companies. Union call for 12-day nationwide standard for reproductive leave The Health Services Union is pushing for 12 days of reproductive leave to be made standard nationwide. Disability service provider Scope has agreed to the leave, which will cover “IVF, severe menstrual pain, endometriosis, vasectomies, menopause, gender transitioning therapies and other health issues”. The HSU now wants the 12-day entitlement to be part of minimum standards and union officials will be in Canberra this week to lobby for the changes. The HSU’s national senior assistant secretary, Kate Marshall, said people, mainly women, were using up all their leave to look after reproductive health. Making 12 days’ reproductive leave part of the minimum entitlements for all workers will have incredible benefits across the entire economy. Women will be able to stay in the workforce longer, build more superannuation and help us close the gender pay gap. Westpac announces new CEO Westpac has announced a new CEO: Anthony Miller will be stepping into the role following Peter King’s retirement. Miller is currently the bank’s chief executive for its business and wealth division, but before joining Westpac, he was head of the Australia/New Zealand division for Deutsche Bank. He was also a partner at Goldman Sachs. He’ll take over the role on 16 December. The governor-general, Sam Mostyn, will receive the royal commission into defence and veterans’ suicide final report at 11am. It will then be up to the government to decide when it is tabled and made public. Penalties for social media companies under proposed ban should be ‘in seven figures’: Malinauskas Peter Malinauskas said in order for the government ban to work, the penalties have to be serious: Well, it has to be seven figures for those companies that knowingly, willingly, break the law with impunity. That comes out of the [Robert] French report. This is about creating an economic deterrence for those companies who really go about their business breaking the law. Infringements will happen, and there are lower levels of infringement notices that can be issued by a regulator under the proposition by Robert French. But where we see the most egregious breaches of the law, where it is done willingly, and then civil penalties can apply, and that would have to be of a seven-figure magnitude and talking about millions of dollars, given the nature of it. Social media companies ‘industrialising addiction’ in children, SA premier says The SA premier said the ban was about doing what is right: I mean, I don’t think that we can overstate this. Parents around the country are tearing their hair out with children who are suffering these addictions and knowing that they’re doing them harm. And even for kids themselves. I mean, you ask children, “do you want to give up social media?”, and they’ll say no. But if you ask them whether or not if they would give up social media if all of their friends would do it as well, they all would gladly give it up. We know that something is up here. We know that the companies industrialise the addiction for their own purpose, which is actually what invites governments to respond, and that’s what we’re going to do in South Australia, and I hope that the rest of the country is able to get on board. Peter Malinauskas says that the SA government is confident it can work out the legal issues with its proposal to ban under 14s, and the tech is there to ensure age verification can work: There are substantial advances made to age verification globally. And they’re already in place in some areas. The commonwealth is now trialling that as a federal level, which we think is a good thing. But it is about putting the obligation upon the companies themselves. This shouldn’t be up to parents or children, or even governments. The governments should be able to impose the obligations upon the services that are, quite frankly, profiteering out of addiction. South Australia’s Labor government wants to ban children who are under 14 from social media. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, told the ABC it was about protecting children: There is now a substantial and growing volume of international peer-reviewed research that makes it clear that social media addiction is actually doing children great harm that can be long lasting, particularly when it comes to their mental health. So what we are seeking to do is replicate what other parts of the world are now doing, and that is putting an obligation upon social media services and platforms from allowing children under the age of 14 getting access to accounts and allowing their addiction to take hold. So, we think that we can go a long way to making a difference. It is not a silver bullet but about making a difference where we can. Government to begin testing age-verification technology for social media platforms The federal government is set to begin testing technologies aimed at verifying the age of social media users and stopping children from accessing adult material, with phase three of the $6.5m age assurance trial starting on Tuesday. The first two phases involved assessing the community’s willingness to use age-verification technologies if they were available, and consulting with industry and key affected and interested sections of the community. The third phase will test the effectiveness of technologies that are activated when a phone, computer or tablet is set up, and those that are activated via an operating system, app store or through individual apps and platforms. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said parents were rightly concerned for their children’s safety. But parents and young people themselves have told me they also expect government to consider privacy, the ethics of different technologies and not isolating young people from their digital native world in our policy response. Rowland said big tech and social media platforms share a responsibility for users’ safety. Any parent hearing the message from social media companies that protecting children from harmful online content is the parent’s sole responsibility would be rightly dismayed.\" The three-phase trial is part of a suite of existing government measures to address issues relating to social media access and influence, including funding free school digital literacy programs and providing free information guides on using parental controls and on talking to kids about online safety. The government is also reviewing the Online Safety Act, introducing codes of practice for platforms in relation to pornography regulation and online dating, and updating its “stop it at the start” anti-misogyny advertising campaign. The age-verification trial is expected to provide guidance on how ready the sector is to provide effective age assurances and provide advice to both government and the eSafety commissioner on the future enforcement of policies and codes of practice. Invasive species could cost NSW nearly $30bn a year by 2030, new report says Failure to properly manage invasive species in New South Wales, including the speed at which some pests spread, could cost the state $29.7bn a year by 2030, according to a new report released by the Minns government. The “worst case scenario” figure is in a Natural Resources Commission review of the management of invasive species in the state, which include feral cats, foxes and weeds. The report finds there has been a lack of strategic planning and resourcing of programs to control or eradicate pests. Among a raft of recommendations, it calls for development of a framework to prioritise and resource programs that reduce current and future risks posed by invasive species. It recommends five yearly funding commitments from Treasury. The report notes that impacts caused by pest animals such as feral cats and foxes are more prominent and well understood and, when each invasive species is considered individually, widespread feral animals have a greater impact than any single weed species. But it adds: However, the overall number of weed species is larger than pest animal species and their combined impacts and associated costs are also much greater. The NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, said the government had already taken some steps towards addressing the recommendations by creating an independent biosecurity commissioner role and committing “record” funding to biosecurity and the NSW Local Land Services. She said the government commissioned the review so it could “understand the problems we inherited from the former Nationals/Liberal government’s management of this critically important area”: We are committed to responding to the NRC report comprehensively and we are already reviewing the current compliance settings to make sure they are fit for purpose. In addition, we will be making sure that public land managers are not only compliant but are leading the way in how they manage the public estate for future generations. Hello and welcome back to parliament, where we pick up where we left off – with the government trying to define itself as handling the cost-of-living crisis and the opposition doing all it can to derail the government’s narrative. In the parliament, the super on paid parental leave legislation will be up for debate, and the legislation to put in place the phased-in 15% pay rise for early childhood educators will be introduced. The Hecs legislation will also be debated (that is the one changing how interest is indexed), but all eyes will be on the future made in Australia legislation debate, given its importance to the Albanese government. You’ll also see the independent parliamentary standards commission legislation, logging laws and multinational tax pop up in the legislative mix. After two weeks in a mess of its own making over scrapping gender and sexuality questions from the census, the government has reverse-ferreted and announced the 2026 census will have a gender and sex section after all. It still won’t ask questions on variations of innate sex characteristics, but it is hoping that reinstating the other questions will cut down on criticisms. But so far this year, the parliamentary weeks have been dominated by what Peter Dutton and the opposition are doing, as the legislative agenda gets pushed to the side. With the ongoing argument over the government’s response to the reserve bank, inflation and cost of living in general, don’t expect that to change. Meanwhile, the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide will be handed down, with the government to decide when it is tabled. The number one recommendation in the interim report, reinforced by the commission in its closing ceremony, is for an oversight body – with teeth – to be established, to ensure that all agencies and departments follow through with what needs to happen in addressing the issue. We’ll follow all the day’s news and more as the first sitting day unfolds. You have Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Sarah Basford Canales and Daniel Hurst with you in Canberra and Mike Bowers behind the camera. You’ll also have me, Amy Remeikis, with you on the blog. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "TV audiences are plummeting, so how is sport bucking the trend?",
          "bodyText": "There was an undisputed winner of the summer of sport, which ended on Sunday night as the most spectacular Paralympics in living memory came to a close. Sport itself, and the unerring way it keeps so many of us watching – especially in a world where TV viewing figures increasingly resemble Tom Daley diving off a 10-metre platform. The numbers really were staggering: 23.8 million across BBC and ITV for England’s Euro 2024 final defeat, the highest UK audience of the year. The BBC’s Olympics coverage topped the charts for 17 consecutive days, with 5 million to 7 million viewers. Channel 4 also enjoyed Paralympics audiences that regularly hopped over a million. Broadcast TV figures have plummeted by 26% since 2015 – yet sport is the bubble that refuses to burst, the ratings winner that bucks the trend. Over the same period, it has fallen just 3%. Some of that is due to big falls in highlight shows, with Sky recently posting record figures for its live Premier League coverage. All of us will have our favourite moments from the summer: Jude Bellingham’s survive-or-die overhead kick against Slovakia, igniting a previously moribund England; a men’s 1500m final for the ages in Paris; Carlos Alcaraz dissecting Novak Djokovic with a matador’s relish at Wimbledon, before the Serb got revenge at the Olympics. But the fact is we watched it in our droves. As Enders Analysis, a company regarded as the gold standard for media research, put it in a recent report: “There is still a widespread misconception that sports viewing has declined at the same pace as the rest of broadcast TV due to increased competition, the high price of pay TV and the supposed short attention spans of the social media generation. In fact, sports viewing has been the most resilient component of broadcast TV.” As Enders points out, it’s not just the big-ticket items on network TV which are flying either. In fact, young viewers now consume nearly half of their sports through Sky, “dwarfing the combined efforts of the BBC and ITV, which refutes the widely held view that young people don’t watch sport behind a paywall”, while TNT Sports has also seen its audience share rise. That is noteworthy, given price rises and piracy concerns due to firesticks. And there is a final surprise in the Enders report. “Fears that young people are no longer interested in sport are overblown,” it says, pointing out that “sport is now a growing proportion of all under-35s’ live TV set viewing: 17% in 2023, up from 7% in 2015”. That is backed up by Jonathan Licht, the managing director of Sky Sports. He tells me that on Sunday 1 September, Sky Sports had its highest ever share of total TV viewing audiences for under-35s and women between 2pm and 6pm. “We’ve talked about how young fans tend to follow sport rather than always watch it,” he says. “But they do come for the big sport. Last weekend when we had Manchester United v Liverpool, the Italian Grand Prix, the Old Firm and the US Open, 60% of all under-35s that were watching TV were tuned to Sky Sports.” Sky Sports also had more than 10% of all women viewers watching TV last Sunday – a record. “It may be harder to bring those younger audiences to TV generally,” Licht says. “But they are coming in for sport.” So who are the winners and losers? Unsurprisingly football dominance has grown to the extent that it now “draws more viewing than the next nine sports combined and of the top sports is the youngest skewing”, according to Enders. Cricket also did well last year, largely because of the Ashes and the Hundred, while Formula One’s audiences have recovered since going behind a paywall in 2019. Women’s football and the NFL are also growing, according to Licht. The losers? The Enders report points out that rugby’s 2023 World Cup audiences fell a fifth on 2015, despite England doing well, and it also warns that “English club rugby is in an existentially unhealthy state”. Most Olympic sports, outside of the Games, also still struggle. But overall the picture is rosier than you might expect. How can we explain this? Partly it is because in a world of personalised algorithms and subcultures, sport is one of few glues that bind us together. It helps, too, that it has to be watched live. But Enders also credits broadcasters and leagues “for maintaining sport’s appeal in a changing media landscape”. There is a final point. Britain really does love sport. That much is made clear in “Game Changing: How sport makes us happier, healthier and better connected”, research out this week. The report, published by Sky and compiled by the policy agency Public First, says that UK adults “have spent approximately 9.1bn hours watching and participating in sports” in the past year. It also found that 15 million people across the UK “went as far as to say that sport is an important part of their identity”. And while sport is still seen as the toy factory, and remains down the list of the government’s priorities, the report makes clear the public is keen on more investment to encourage young people to enjoy sport. Meanwhile, broadcasters continue to face dangerous headwinds. According to Ofcom, less than half of 16- to 24-year-olds now watch TV in an average week, down from 78% in 2018. They also spend far more time on TikTok and YouTube than watching live TV. Sport probably can’t defy this gravity for ever. But so far it is giving it a damn good shot."

          "headline": "Monday briefing: What Nvidia’s stock market plunge means for the AI industry",
          "bodyText": "Good morning. For a long time, the only people who knew the name Nvidia were tech nerds and gamers. For about two decades the company was trundling along, carving a niche with its specialised computer chips, GPUs, which enhanced image display for computers, and making a tidy profit. But in the 2000s, experts realised Nvidia’s chips could do more than process graphics for video games – the tech could also be used to process the intricate equations driving AI systems. Nvidia’s decision to take a gamble on AI (and fortuitous timing), led it to eventually becoming the most valuable company in the world for a short time, overtaking Microsoft. Since the launch of ChatGPT, the company’s stock has gone gangbusters, soaring by 239% in 2023. Its CEO, Jensen Huang (pictured above) has become something of a celebrity unto himself, and has been dubbed the “Taylor Swift of tech”. GPUs are now the de facto way that generative AI is powered. But what goes up, inevitably, must come down. Geopolitical tensions, legal problems and concerns about an “AI bubble” have left the $3tn company facing an uncertain future, with $279bn (£212bn) wiped off its value in just one day last week. To unpick this story, I spoke with tech writer Chris Stokel-Walker. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Covid | A landmark study has uncovered corruption “red flags” in government Covid contracts worth more than £15bn – representing nearly one in every three pounds awarded by the Conservative administration during the pandemic. Politics | As many as 50 Labour MPs could refuse to back the government’s controversial plan to cut the winter fuel allowance, despite Keir Starmer urging back benchers to get behind a measure he has conceded is “unpopular”. Healthcare | Almost half of doctors internationally have been sexually harassed by patients, new research has found, prompting calls for medics to be given panic alarms to help repel such behaviour. US elections | Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the election campaign, according to a national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, raising the stakes of Tuesday’s presidential debate. Transport | Local transport authorities across England will be able to run and control bus services under a Labour overhaul designed to “save vital routes”, parliament will hear on Monday. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the “bus revolution” would empower local communities as the government prepares to formally announce measures to make services more reliable. In depth: ‘You cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia’ To emphasise the centrality of Nvidia’s products to generative AI, Chris equates its chips to oil. “You cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia’s products”, he says. Every company wants in on their tech, and it’s theirs if they cough up anywhere between $30,000 to $40,000 per AI chip. And companies are more than happy to fork out those sums – Nvidia announced record revenues of $30bn in just one quarter. “If you track Nvidia from its initial public offering in 1999 to when it became the world’s most valuable company, it experienced a 591,000% increase in its share price,” Chris says. So, if the demand is there, why has Nvidia’s value dropped so dramatically? *** Unsustainable growth For two years, Nvidia’s growth has been unprecedented, and investors wanted the company to maintain its momentum. But the simplest explanation for Nvidia’s plateau is that its rise has been unsustainable and time-limited. “People thought that Nvidia was going to continue growing at that pace,” Chris says. The company is now in a strange situation where, even though their growth rate is still high – their revenue was up a record-breaking 15% from last quarter – it still falls short of market expectations, with shares taking a 7% hit. “Practically any other CEO in the world would be overjoyed with the growth that Nvidia is seeing, but because it’s not like the obscene surges that were seen in prior years people are finding it a little bit underwhelming,” he adds. The jitters around Nvidia’s slowdown is mirroring a wider concern about sky-high valuations in the AI sector. For the last year and a half, Wall Street has been throwing bucket-loads of money into the sector, but now it seems that investors are slightly more reserved, as they become more clear-eyed about the extent to which generative AI is going to become a transformative, world-changing technology. “I think most people still think that there will be an impact, but they maybe don’t think that everything is going to change quite as quickly as many thought,” Chris says. *** Supply chains While Nvidia owns the technology, they do not mine or create the raw materials themselves, leaving them vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Their primary supplier is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, and there is apprehension about possible supply chain disruption given the increasing hostility between Taiwan and China. “There is unease [about what would happen if] China decided to do something to Taiwan, then suddenly, what is already a very tight supply of chips which are being sold as fast as they’re being produced, could become even tighter,” Chris says. It has the potential, he says, to derail the whole supply chain. *** Legal woes A report from analytics platform CB Insights estimates that Nvidia has 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, effectively creating a monopoly. According to reports, the US justice department has begun ramping up an antitrust investigation into whether the company has breached competition laws. “Nvidia can, to a degree, both name its own price and terms, so there are some concerns by antitrust officials that the company could be offering perks to those who block-book with them,” Chris says. The US is also highly concerned about Nvidia selling its chips to China, which, they believe, is using the technology to modernise its military capabilities. With a degree of success, Washington has set up a tech blockade by banning the export of advanced chips – but, as a New York Times investigation found, Nvidia has simply found workarounds and these chips are still ending up in China. *** Is there a bubble? Nvidia is not like one of the many so-called unicorn tech startups of the last decade that were wildly overvalued while offering very little in the way of goods, services or profit. It has sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its product and there continues to be huge demand. But Wall Street analysts are split about its future. “Some are saying it’s a boom stock, others aren’t quite as negative yet but they have started winding down their expectations for growth in the last month or so,” Chris says. In a situation where there is a bubble – and it does pop – the wider knock-on effect, not just on Nvidia and the tech sector but also on the broader economy, could be significant. “There is this worry in the air, where people are wondering, are we seeing a replication here of the dotcom bubble,” Chris says. “But we just don’t have the answer right now”.

          "headline": "Impact of Covid lockdowns to disrupt England’s schools into the 2030s, report says",
          "bodyText": "Repairing the damage to children’s education caused by the pandemic lockdowns and closures will disrupt England’s schools until the mid-2030s, according to a new report. The analysis, published by the Association for School and College Leaders (ASCL), forecasted that the after-effects of the pandemic will hit schools in a series of waves, with different age groups requiring varying solutions for their problems with learning, behaviour and absence. Tim Oates, the report’s author and an expert on assessment, said: “While secondary schools are reporting an increase in reading difficulties among year 7 pupils, poor personal organisation and challenging patterns of interaction, staff in primary schools are reporting very serious problems of arrested language development, lack of toilet training, anxiety in being in social spaces, and depressed executive function.” Oates said it was a mistake to think schools have returned to pre-pandemic normality that ignores “the massive scale and enduring persistence of Covid-19 impact in education”. Recovery “will be a long slog, not a walk in the park”, requiring “protracted, grinding effort” and cooperation between schools, parents and the government, he added. Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the ASCL, said: “This report shows that, while the headlines have moved on from Covid-19, the impact on schools and children remains a day-to-day reality. “Unfortunately, the previous government failed to get to grips with this issue, ignoring recommendations from its own education recovery commissioner for a substantial and ongoing package of support for children and young people. “Schools continue to see high rates of pupil absence and they have many pupils with complex needs. At the same time they are struggling with severe budget pressures, staff shortages and a special educational needs system on the brink of collapse. “We urge the new government to work with us on developing targeted, well-funded policies that respond to the challenges outlined in this report.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know the pandemic has had a profound impact on children’s development – and we are determined to break down barriers to opportunity and improve the life chances of all children. “We’re also committed to providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school to increase attendance, and ensuring earlier intervention in mainstream schools for pupils with special needs.” The Guardian has reported concerns among school leaders and experts that there could be further classroom disruption in the coming school year, as a “behaviour bubble” of pupils affected by the Covid-era lockdowns at primary school reach the peak ages for suspensions and exclusions. But Oates’ report said that even babies born during the pandemic now starting in primary schools were likely to be profoundly affected throughout their education. “Covid-19 impact is not a thing of the past; it is moving like a series of different waves up through the system,” Oates said. “Eleven-year-olds affected by interrupted learning are entering secondary school with very different problems to those born and young in the pandemic entering primary schools, who are displaying acute developmental needs,” said Oates, the group director of assessment research and development at Cambridge University Press and Assessment. Those born during the pandemic “now appear to be prone to fundamental problems in cognitive and social development”, he said, bringing educational challenges that “will continue to unfold over the next five to 10 years as children whose early development was affected by the pandemic pass through school”. The report criticises the government’s post-pandemic response, including funding extra academic help for pupils through the national tutoring programme (NTP), as uneven and “headline-grabbing” that failed to reach disadvantaged children. Di’Iasio said: “While this report shows that the NTP had mixed success, it was at least something, and it has been replaced by nothing.” Oates said that recovery policies now in place do not match the scale of the challenges facing schools. “An evidence-driven response requires strategy and resources co-designed by schools, unions and the government. It will require parental support and community engagement. It will require protracted, grinding effort. It will require politicians dedicated to following the detail of what is happening on the ground, analysing data, listening to schools and fine-tuning strategy,” he said."
